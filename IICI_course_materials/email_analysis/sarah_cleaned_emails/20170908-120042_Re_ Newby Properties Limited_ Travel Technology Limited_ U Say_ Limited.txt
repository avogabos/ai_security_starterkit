I looked under my account number 84611716 and I can see

U Say Limited
Travel Technology Limited

I cannot see Newby Properties Limited - is that under a different account number?
When I went online I did find the renewal reminder for Travel Technology from 2nd July - apologies for my mistake on that.
Anyway, how do I automate the renewals for all 3 companies to avoid any future problems?
I would like to deal with that today if possible.
Many thanks.
Best regards.
Tim.
