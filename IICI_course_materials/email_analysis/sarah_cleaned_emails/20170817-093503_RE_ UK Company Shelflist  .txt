In the UK it is not required for the bank as they check the company at
Companies House to see current owner/ shareholder etc.

If the client wishes to have an Incumbency for their records we can provide
for £150

 

Ok, we can do that, but one thing to state on the name chnge, it can be
changed at companies house now, but the bank account will still have the old
company name until after they take over the account, and then the name
change form can be done then too. The bank dont orry too much about
matching the name, its more matching the company reg number etc

Dear Sarah,

 

Please advise is the a certificate of incumbency of the UK company required
for the banks requirement at change owner and change of company name, one
for each? What is your fee quotation for the certificate?

 

The customer is planning to purchase the company first and use your service
to file all information on-line and also change the company name afterward.
Is it OK to do all the filings now including the change of the company name
and the customer comes to UK in September for taking over the bank account?
Or the bank account must be updated within a certain period of time after
the company is acquired by the customer? Maybe only proceed the whole
process a little bit earlier before the customers arrival to UK?

 

Please advise.

 

 

Thank you.

 

Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact us.

 

 

Best Regards,

Scottie Liu
