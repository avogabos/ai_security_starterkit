Dear  .

 

In relation to the sale of the Active company Corporate App Limited to your
client, I can confirm that the company is free of any liens and
encumbrances.

The accounts for the company have been filed up to date and will be due next
year. For the period of 2017 in which the company is still under my
ownership I confirm the company has made no sales nor purchases and
therefore any accounts to be prepared for this current accounting period
should only consider transactions taken place from the date your client
takes ownership of the company.

 

Should any debt, penalty or other encumbrance arise following the transfer
of ownership that is due to activities or actions undertaken during my
active directorship then I shall take the responsibility of these directly.
