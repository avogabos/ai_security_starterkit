Dear Sarah,

We made a annual accounts filing request online for Business Resources Asia
Limited. It might be a late filing so please tell us the penalty cost.


Also please check if any letters from RBS are received at your office.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,

Asami Yamada
