Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well.

Please note that we called this week and we were informed by one of your colleagues that the page should be up and running by today.

Unfortunately, we tried to login today without success. When should the service be brought back to normal?

Additionally, is the a possible alternate webpage where we can access the information in the meantime?

Regards,

Ana
