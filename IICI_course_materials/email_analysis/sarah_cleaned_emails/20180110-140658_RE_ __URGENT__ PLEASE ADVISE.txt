Hi Rachel

 

Yes I see the emails and messages and I realise I do not always reply.

 

The situation is somewhat untenable and this week I am discussing with Fahad
what we can do to alleviate some pressure. 

Sales are virtually non existent, and as we appear to only be reactive to
incoming sales and not proactively seeking new customers etc I cannot see
that the sales will increase enough to manage the business. 

I am still hopeful to resolve the cashflow crisis with an alternative, but
right now I don't have an exact idea

 

We can pay for one van to stay in service, 

In terms of due pays, we will bring it all up to date but I cannot tell you
exactly when.

 

The situation in the London office is the same, I have not taken a salary
fro some time and with all savings I had put into the business I also face
difficult time, as I am a single parent.

 

Im remaining positive and hopeful as I know the business can pick up and the
projects I have been working on will pay out but meantime you will need to
decide what is best for you.

 

Thanks

Hi Charlotte,

 

I hope you are doing well.

 

We wanted to speak to you about our salary and commission which is due since
October 2017. We have messaged and emailed you on numerous occasions
regarding it and have not received any response. We would appreciate a reply
from you about it as is not easy for us. We have bank payments and bills etc
which are overdue.

 

Rizwan and Fahad does not seem to have any information about it.

 

Also, our van driver will discontinue his services if his bill is not
settled soon and we do not have enough funds to come to office. We informed
Fahad and Rizwan about it last week.

 

Please advise. Thank you!

 

Regards,

 

Preeti & Sarah
