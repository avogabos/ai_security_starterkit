Dear Valued Customer, 

Our New Address

We're delighted to inform all our customer that our new, permanent registered address is now confirmed. We are well aware that the uncertainty during the switch over of our registered/mailing address may have had an affect on many of you, and we are truly grateful for the patience and support expressed by many of our customers. As stated previously, any mail items addressed to 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR are being collected and sorted as before so there should be no concern for any mail service during our move of Service Address.

Formations House took the search for a new address very seriously; we were insistent on finding a long-term, stable solution to ensure there would be no need for our clients to swap their address again.

The new address for all our registered/mailing address services is:
85 Great Portland Street
London
W1W 7LT

Meeting rooms are available at 85 Great Portland Street to all our customers with address services registered there, subject to availability. Should you require the use of a meeting room at our new address, please contact our sales team at sales@formationshouse.com <mailto:sales@formationshouse.com> .

Collections
For those customers who wish to collect their mail in person, all collections will take place from our main office, at 22 Harley Place, W1G 8LZ (click here for a map <https://goo.gl/maps/Vosd3JagziA2> ). It will not be possible to collect mail from Great Portland Street under any circumstances.

What You Have To Do
For those customers with active registered address/virtual office packages with Formations House, we will automatically change your registered office at Companies House. Customers may need to change their address with their banks, or other institutions and with their clients..


Our Offer To You
As a token of goodwill, and to thank you for your continued loyalty, we are freezing the price of all our address services (registered address, virtual office, directors’ privacy service) for the next three years for existing service users. The price of certain address services may be adjusted for new customers in the following weeks. We will also be offering some alternative addresses in the coming months for customers who would like to establish their company presence in other parts of London.


We hope the resolution of this issue is satisfactory to all our customers, but should you have any remaining concerns or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@formationshouse.com <mailto:info@formationshouse.com> .
