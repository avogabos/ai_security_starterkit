Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your email.

Please I also like to know what documents will be signed by the client in order to take over the company?

And will the owner of the company sign a letter to bear all responsibilities of the company before the date of transferring the ownership of the company to our client? The client wishes the letter could be notarized in UK.



Thank you.

Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact us.

Dear Scottie,

Thank you for your email.

Please note that the company your client is interested in purchasing is a previously trading company. The accounts for Corporate App show small trading turnover with no profit, which is the case.

The company Corporate App had a loan which completed in 2015, its completely satisfied and we will provide a letter to confirm. The credit report is also clean and all taxes etc are up to date

Purchasing a company that has an existing bank account with absolutely no prior trading or business activity is rather uncommon, as banks tend not to open accounts for non-trading companies or for the purpose of being sold on unused.

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
