Subject: 2 invoices for TERMSAT (Renewal & COGS)

 

Hi, 

I have checked the records. The payment of GBP 130 that was made by FH was
for the COGS ordered(invoice issued by Mayfair attached). The second invoice
is for the renewal of the company; we need to make the 2nd payment of GBP
155(invoice issued by Mayfair attached) to bring the company back to good s
tanding. Customer renewed the company (193679; GBP 500).

 

Thanks
