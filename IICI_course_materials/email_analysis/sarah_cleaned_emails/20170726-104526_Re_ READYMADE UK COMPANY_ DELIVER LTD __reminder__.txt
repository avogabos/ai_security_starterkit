Dear Sarah

Thanks for your email

As I stated in my previous email your asking price is way to expensive for
me.

I am a sole trader just starting a business .

The fact it is a 12 year old company is of no value to me .

I just like the name that s all. I have registered deliver app ltd but I do
like deliver ltd and am keen to negotiate but you are asking wsg more than
I can afford.

I will increase my offer to 750 pounds for the company .

Regards
