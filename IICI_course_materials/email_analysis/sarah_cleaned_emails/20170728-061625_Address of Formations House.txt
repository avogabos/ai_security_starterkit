Dear Rachel,

Hope all is well.

We have dispatched the original Certificate of Restoration of MICROGLOBAL TECHNOLOGY UK LIMITED to your UK office last Friday and I have just be informed that your address is relocated.

May I have your new address for update our records and deliver the Certificate?

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact us.



Best regards,
Nim
