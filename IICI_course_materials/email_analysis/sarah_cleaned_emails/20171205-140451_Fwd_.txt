Hi,

Bank Account details for ITS Natwest 60-17-21 acc numb 99159686

please let me know when this is done.

As to vat number you as to our conversation which I relayed to others was
that you would apply for vat number free for us and as such I can only pay
your
original invoice.

Andrew Peter Clark’s is to be the sole director, shareholder and PSC
officer in the company.



Once he is appointed and is added as a director in Bank Account; we will
then remove our director and back date the termination   - ok

We cannot provide online login as it’s tied to the current director; the
new director will receive his own login after he is added- ok



if we can do tomorrow at 2pm Andy will go in to the branch. Will he meet
someone from your company or go alone ?

I will get docs over to you as required
