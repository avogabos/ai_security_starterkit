Hi Sarah,

 

Unfortunately we will be traveling again tonight. We are now infront of 29 Harley st. And the offices seem to be under construction.

 

Have you moved to a new location?

 

If it would at all be possible for you to meet us for a few minutes that would be greatly appreciated.

 

I realize this is short notice and I do apologize.

 

Many thanks &

Best regards,

Eyvi

Hello Sarah,

 

We are in London now, can we pop by your office and sign the papers with you? That way we can also discuss the whole process.

 

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

 

Do I need to fill out any additional information on the pages or are the forms completed and ready for signature? I see that one of the files is 62 pages long, I’m not an expert at these things and I do not want to make any mistakes. Can you advise?

 

Many thanks and
