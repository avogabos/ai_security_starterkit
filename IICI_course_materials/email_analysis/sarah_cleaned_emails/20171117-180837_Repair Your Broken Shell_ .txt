Repair Your Broken Shell!
“
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.”
~Jean de La Fontaine
I walk past the house of the Smiths every day while returning from my morning jog. Most of the days Mrs. Smith is up and about working on her garden or strolling with her earplugs in. Each time she sees me she beams warmly at me.
We had never really exchanged any words, but she was still part of my day with her radiant smile and soothing demeanor. Recently, I rarely saw her or if at all she was there she would sit still staring into space, listless and morose.
I often got a gut call to inquire after her when she wasn’t there for days in a row, but I hesitated until one day I saw her garden deserted, plants dying and grass unkempt. I rang the doorbell and a woman answered after what seemed like eternity. My mind juggled with the idea of turning back and moving on in the direction I came from, after all I had a lot to accomplish in the day, while a part of me kept pushing me to find out if everything was okay with her.
