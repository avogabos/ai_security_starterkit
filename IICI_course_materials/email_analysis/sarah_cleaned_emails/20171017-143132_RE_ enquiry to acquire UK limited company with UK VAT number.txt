Dear Sarah 

 

I received your telephone message but have been unable to ring your number.
I have tried a few times now. 

Therefore I send you this email to the email provided in your message. 

 

As mentioned earlier we would like to find a suitable UK company that is
already registered for VAT and has a valid UK VAT number. 

Please let me know if your firm is able to help us find a suitable company. 

 

 

Kind regards 
Mary Prendergast
