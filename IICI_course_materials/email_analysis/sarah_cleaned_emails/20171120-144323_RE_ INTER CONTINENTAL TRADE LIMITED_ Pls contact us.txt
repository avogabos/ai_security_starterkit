Thank you kindly for your update, hopefully this means that the company will be up and running again this week, right? 

I’m really getting anxious to start using the company and unfreeze our bank account for trading.

 

Many thanks again &

Hi Sarah,

 

Unfortunately we will be traveling again tonight. We are now infront of 29 Harley st. And the offices seem to be under construction.

 

Have you moved to a new location?

 

If it would at all be possible for you to meet us for a few minutes that would be greatly appreciated.

 

I realize this is short notice and I do apologize.

 

Many thanks &

Best regards,

Eyvi
