Dear Peter,
Thank you for your email.
Please confirm the Name of the company you have finalized so
that I may advise accordingly.
Also, we will do the appointments and termination and file
Confirmation Statement accordingly.  We can change the name of the company; the
cost of the service is GBP 25 +  VAT. We  will contact Companies House to check
if it is possible to back date the name change.
Also advise if Andrew Peter Clark is the sole director,
shareholder and PSC officer in the RM Company?
We look forward to hear from you.
