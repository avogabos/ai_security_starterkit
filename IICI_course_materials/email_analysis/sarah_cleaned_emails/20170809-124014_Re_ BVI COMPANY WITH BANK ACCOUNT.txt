the BVI Business Companies Act 2004, all active company must file their
Register of Director at the BVI Registry. New incorporations have up to 21 days
after incorporation to file the ROD with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs.
This amendment is a response to the policies enforced under FATF 40, whereby
there was a recommendation that directors’ information on companies to be
maintained on a central register. This measure ensures that the BVI remains
compliant with international financial initiatives, particularly those
initiatives relating to the automatic exchange of information and the fight
against money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
The first registration of Directors requires both a government
fee and an agent fee for the local agent to file with the government. The
combined first cost for an existing BVI company will be £600.After the due
date; the cost to file will increase. Failure to file at all will incur a
penalty and the company to be removed from the register.
Hence, you will be required to also make the payment of the
Register of Director filing fee of GBP 600 with company incorporation.
FEE:

follows:
BVI company Formation: GBP 770

documents for company director/s and shareholder/s:
- Proof of ID (Passport copy or driving license copy)
- Proof of Address (Bank statement, bank letter or a utility
bill i.e. Electricity or Water or Gas stating director’s name and address and
issued within the last 3 months).
The company will be formed in 15 - 20 Working days. Once the
company is formed; it will take about 1 week’s time to receive the company
documents.
Regarding Bank Account, the bank accounts we offer are
maintained at Euro Pacific Bank which is an offshore bank based in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines and provide banking facilities such as online banking and
bank transfer services etc. You will be required to have an online meeting on

The cost of the service is GBP 500 and you will also be required
to purchase Apostille set of company documents which will be needed for Bank
Account opening service.

currencies:
