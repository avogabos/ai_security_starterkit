Apologies for the problems coursed mainly as a result of my being at my
mothers funeral yesterday............. all payments should have come
through us as we own 25% of the holding company and manage all the finances
and the new company will now come in to the group. ITS should not have made
the payment as its going to be very difficult to then have them repaid as
we do not like inter company payments.

We would look to keeping with the current company if the Vat provided is an
established number of 1 year plus as we can apply for Vat number ourselves.
If you can do this, once ITS have been refunded we will pay you immediately.

We would have paid you ourselves had we not been told that you took credit
cards, which was RCD preferred way of payment.

I wait your reply.

Dear
Peter,
I
need to clarify the position currently.
We
have been communicating for some time for the purchase of a Readymade company,
and I have sent options including Interpath ltd and also the higher priced
Mobile Electrics Ltd which has a VAT number and a bank account with Natwest.
You
were aware of the pricing at the time of quoting, and agreed to proceed with
the purchase of Interpath Ltd.
I
have received the due diligence documents for this and raised the invoice,
which you say is paid however its not yet showing cleared in our account.
You
have now returned and stated you must have a company with VAT, and I have
requoted the options we have available and at the prices we offer.
We
cannot sell a company with VAT for the same price as one without, as this would
not make good sense as a business.
I
am prepared to offer VAT registration with Interpath, at no additional cost,
however if you wish to purchase a company with VAT in place, you will need to
pay the difference in cost for Mobile Electrics.
As
a gesture of goodwill, I am authorised to offer a further discount of £1000
from the price, meaning the cost of Mobile Electrics is £9000 plus VAT.
If
you prefer a refund, we will have to wait until the funds show in our account
and I can request my manager to refund the sum paid.
We
will not however agree to provide a company we have quoted twice before and now
offered a discount on, for the same cost as the one you have to date agreed to
purchase.
Kind
Regards
Sarah
