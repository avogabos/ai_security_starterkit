Mail Request
Hello Sarah,
It has been a long time since I last contacted you. How have
you been?
We would like to ask you something. Do you remember that
Seven Star Management Limited requested you to send mails from your office to
Japanese clients? They firstly sent a parcel that contains some envelops to
your office and you opened the parcel and sent back the envelops to the
Japanese address written on it. It successfully worked at the beginning but you
just kept the envelops in your office ultimately and some of their clients did
not receive mails. This may have been happened because of communication
negligence in your office. You needed to tell clearly about their order to the
person in charge of mails. However, this time, we would like you to do it
without any mistakes for our client.
Once again, all you will have to do is open the parcel,
check the number of envelops in it, bring all the envelops to post office and
send them by an ordinary mail. The envelops already contain letters in them and
destination and the sender's address are already written. You just open the box
and bring the letters to post office. It is going to be twice a month and 50-100
envelops each time.
Each envelop contains only one letter so it weighs only
about 10 grams.
If you can do this, please tell us the cost for mailing of 1
envelop. If the cost is acceptable, we will order a company formation in UK
with the service.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Asami Yamada
