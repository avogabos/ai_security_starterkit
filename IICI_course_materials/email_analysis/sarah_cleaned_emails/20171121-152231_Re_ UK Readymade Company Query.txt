Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your email.

Please advise if the client used your managed company service, how could he be able to apply the pre-paid card of the company?

Kindly confirm is the company with the HSBC bank account able to apply a credit/debit/prepaid card? Not applying one for the director but one for the company.


Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Scottie Liu

Dear Scottie,

Thank you for your email.

Please note that we do not usually provide this with managed company, but there is possibly subject to customer compliance. We can wither provide the card number to customer so they can use the debit card for online orders etc or they can apply for a pre-pay card themselves and request us to top that card up from the managed account.

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

We look forward to hear from you soon.

Best Regards,

Sarah
