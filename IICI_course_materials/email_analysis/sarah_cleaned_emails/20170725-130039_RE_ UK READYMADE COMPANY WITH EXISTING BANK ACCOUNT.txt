We have companies with hsbc,, but reg at Harley st where other amazon and
ebay accounts are stored

 

What we would need to do is use an alternative address for the business
addres,, ie buy from another agent,

Ask if needs to be London based or not

 

And on the business, UTR no problem but did they also require VAT?
