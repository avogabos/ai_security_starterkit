Dear Valued Customers,
Further to our

earlier this year of the increase by the BVI Government of fees and penalties in respect of most Registry transactions for BVI Business Companies, we would like to kindly remind you that the increase will be effective 1
st
January 2018, and will apply to all transactions effected at the BVI Registry after that date. (Click here forÂ  the
"BVI Business Companies Act (Amendment of Schedule 1) (No.3) Order, 2016"

Accordingly, commencing 1
st
January 2018, the Government fee on the incorporation of new companies with authorized shares of no more than 50,000, or the renewal of such companies will be increased from USD350 to USD450. For further details of changes in BVI Government fees, please refer to the attached schedule.
We have been further advised that, starting in 2018, in respect of all renewals of BVI Business Companies the Registered Agent will charge a USD50 Compliance Fee which will be included in the annual renewal invoice.
