Hi

 

Yes customer is right we will not charge him any VAT and mark this
transaction as zero rated vat sales. I have verified the VAT number. If  any
of our customer belongs to any EU country and provide us valid VAT number
then we will not charge any VAT.

Hi, pls advise!

----------

Dear Sarah, 

you have become VAT payer? Please, provide us with your VAT number. Anyway,
we cannot agree with charging the VAT to the services due to the Reverse
charge system. As our company Haglley Corporation s.r.o. is based in the
Czech republic and we are still in the European Union, the Sixth directive
and the Reverse charge system is applied (Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17
May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to
turnover taxes - Common system of value-added tax: uniform basis of
assessment).

Please see attached the extract from the Czech Companies House and also
extract stating our VAT number, which is CZ27433196 (you can verify the
number at the below mention VIES link).
