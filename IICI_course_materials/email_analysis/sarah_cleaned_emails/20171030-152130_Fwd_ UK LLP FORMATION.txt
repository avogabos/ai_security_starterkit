Hi Sarah,

Thank you for getting back with me so quickly and for the information as
well, but I may have misunderstood the website. 

I am looking to purchase an already-established LLP company, preferably
a dormant one. Does Formations House provide this service? 

Thank you and I apologize for the confusion. 

Best Regards,
Jagoda Janiak
