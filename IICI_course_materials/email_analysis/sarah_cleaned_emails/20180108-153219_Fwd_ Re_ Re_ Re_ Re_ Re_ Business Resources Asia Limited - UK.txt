Dear Sarah,

Hope all is well with you.
As you can see from the email below, we have successfully filed the annual
accounts for Business Resources Asia Limited lately. However, since it is
an overdue filing, you should have received some notice regarding the
penalty from Companies House to this company. Please check if some letters
are arrived at your office or not.


We look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Asami Yamada
