Dear Ross, 

 

As you can see from the email below the bank has declined the application due to the business activities.

 

We can submit another application to another bank that may work for you, but there may be application fees and we cannot guarantee they will open either. 

 

Please could you kindly advise what it is you require from the bank account?

 

Kind regards

Hi Nadya,

 

After reviewing the documents and speaking to the client, our compliance department determined that the client was not a good fit. His business revolves around managing third party funds. This is a prohibited business activity.

 

We regret to inform you that his application has been denied at this time. 

 

Best regards,
