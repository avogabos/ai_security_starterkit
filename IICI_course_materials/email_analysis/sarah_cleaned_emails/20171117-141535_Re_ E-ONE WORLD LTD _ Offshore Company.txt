Thank you Dear Sarah,

I want to tell I've really appreciated our meeting with Charlotte on
Wednessday - I notice her professionalism.

As you say let proceed step by step and start first with E-One World ltd
dissolution. Can you send me please a link to pay the 660 £ ?

Once this is done and company account closed, I will provide you all the
documents requested and my accountant will propose a service contract for
the due diligence to be reviewed together.

I wish you an excellent weekend.
Best Regards,
Costin

Dear
Customer,
Please
find attached the proforma invoice for filing the Accounts and processing the
company dissolution for
E-ONE
WORLD LTD. The total cost of the service is GBP 550 + VAT.
Additionally
according to the conversation with Ms Pawar, she advises an international
company and bank account for a fee of 1200 + VAT. However we will confirm if

In
relation to the other business discussed in the terms of providing contract
services she will email directly once the first stage is complete.
Please
feel free to email her directly on
charlotte@formationshouse.com
regarding
that in the mean time.
Due
Diligence Details & Documents:
•
Certified passport copy of each beneficial owner, director and shareholder;
•
Certified proof of address document of each beneficial owner, director and
shareholder;
•
Particulars of the business activities of the company in detail;
