Dear Sirs/Madam,

With reference to the below email, we have created the emails accounts
that we wanted as per the guidance provided by you.

Now we would like to know the following:

1. There are two email IDs in the email account.  For eg.
admin@mmrholding.org was created by us, but automatically another
email ID, admin_73843@10091808.infinioffice.com got created.

admin@mmrholding.org	
admin_73843@10091808.infinioffice.com	

Please clarify.

2. The Administration Panel is not opening.  When it is clicked it
shows the following and remains the same.

"Please Wait while loading the interface......"

3. We are not able to attach any file.

4. What about the size of each email account?

5. How to configure in outlook express?

6. How to configure on iphone, android, etc.

7. POP account details for incoming and outgoing emails.

We look forward to your reply ASAP.

Regards,

Sasikumar
