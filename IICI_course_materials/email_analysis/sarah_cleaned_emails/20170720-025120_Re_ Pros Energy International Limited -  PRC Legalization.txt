Dear Lewis, 



We cannot apostille the Incumbency as I explained before, I presume you meant Certificate of Incorporation?



Please confirm if you would like express or standard service? I believe Sarah has given you detailed information previously?



The cost to courier will be 65GBP.



Kind regards

Nadya
