Good afternoon, Dear Support,

 

I checked the services for our companies in our client system ot the web
site Formation house- and after the controll I have one unfunctional service
registered office address for company WORLD ASSOCIATES OF SPORTING
ORGANIZATIONS LTD, but we paid for this service on the 23th of October 2017.

 

Can you please put it all right?

 

Best Regards
