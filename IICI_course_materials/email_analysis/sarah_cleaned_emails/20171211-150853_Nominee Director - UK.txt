Dear Sarah,


Please note that Mr. Sushant from Phoenix has given me your reference. I
need to discuss with you regarding Sunrise Commodities Limited. Company
number is 07868146.

Please note that the current local direct Mr. Dhava is leaving, therefore,
we need to appoint a local director.

In addition to that we have to open up bank account locally in London with
different banks for trading finance operations and to make this company as
onshore company and next year I will also moving from Dubai and residing in
London to operate the business from London itself. I am just working on
entrepreneurship immigration visa and it will be processed in next 3 month
maximum.

Kindly advise us the procedure to appoint new local director and how to
transfer the company shares on my name.

Many thanks,

Muhammad Imran
