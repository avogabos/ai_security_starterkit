Dear
Customer,
Thank
you for the email.
Please
note that you can purchase our Readymade companies International Commercial Ltd
& TAX CENTRE LTD.
These
are clean readymade companies with up-to-date Annual Accounts and Confirmation
Statements. The cost of the company is GBP 10,000 per company.
However,
you will be required to appoint your own director in the company as we do not
provide
director
for this type of business activity and it might be difficult for us to obtain a
bank account for US transactions. However there are many banking service
providers (not banks) who support the crypto currency market
Best
Regards,
Sarah

Good morning Sarah,
regarding the request of my client, and his needs, I
communicate the following:
- my client intends to buy an LTD or LLC in the UK. I
have identified n. 2 companies available at Formation House: International
Commercial Ltd; Tax Center Ltd.
- Customer activity: brokerage and sale of crypto
currencies
- All payments arrive from the USA and return to the
USA
- Our client requires total management of the company
with the inclusion of only one director of his own competence and another
director of your competence. They require certificates of ownership of the
bearer company.
- The customer requests a bank account in the name
of the company that buys and possibly the opening of a new bank account.
I look forward to knowing if the companies indicated are
still available; which one is the most suitable for my client; what is the
total cost of the operation; what is the annual management cost of the company.
Thanks.
Regarde
