Dear Madam,

I am Deepak from Shikar Dharamsey's office. I have received one mail
from Mr. Bharat Shah regarding the payment of GBP 900/-. once we have
received one mail from AC Online and we have paid the amount. Is it
the same or any separate payment, if it is the same we have done the
payment . Could you please advise us then we can do the necessary
arrangement accordingly.

Thanks and regards,
Deepak.
