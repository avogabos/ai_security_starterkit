Dear Sarah:



I checked with bank again, the bank can not make signature or seal on that reference letter, but it is standard procedure for them to give "Capital proven letter", which gives details of my debit account in certain period of time, normally for applying traveling visa or mortgage.  this letter will be on bank headed paper and with seal on it ( sorry officially Chinese don't use signature)



could you check if this is going to be OK?. but, there is no my address on the letter.



if this is OK, i can have the letter and get translated and notarized.



Best Regard



Bo
