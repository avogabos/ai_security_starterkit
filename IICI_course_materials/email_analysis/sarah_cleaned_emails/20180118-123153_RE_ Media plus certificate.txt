Regarding our company, Media Plus LTD, I'm wondering why the Companeis House dissolved it! Can they give you official writen letter?
Please send the companeis House  a letter to restore it and let me know about the reason.
After you restore the company, we will start with the other steps regarding what I asked through the last email.
Thank you

Media plus certificate
Dear Sara,
I hope you are doing well and fine.
Well, Media Plus still working on our branch in Amman,
Jordan.
After we met the officer at the Comercial and industry
ministry here they ask us to offer them decuoments for License to practice
the profession, such as the company certificate, Memorandum of
Association, Authorized signatory and the 2015 & 2016 Financial
balancing.
All these papers must signed by the British side and the
Jordanian Embassy in London.
Our new branch in the middle East spent mony to finish this
project since 2015 vis 2017. So I can send  you our Expense Table to
use it.
The financial balancing must signed by an Accountant at
Formation House.
The
Authorized
signatory must incloude Autorisation me (Jawdat Hasan Jebreen Manna) the
General Director from the partner of Media Plus to to open a Non-profit
company in Jordan and to use any name for this company. If you want me to send
you the Authorization text I will send it as soon as possible.
Please inform
me about costs of these papers and the Signatures from the House of
Comerce and the Jordanian Embassy in the UK.
Other thing,
while I'm looking to the papers of the company, I found different number of our
cetificate and other country of our original home Pakistan instead of
Palestine. Please explane to us about it.
As you send
us earlier I found that you moved Formation House to onother building. Is that
mean we must change the Media Plus Company adres! Please let me know.
Please do not
hesitate to ask for mor informaton.
Thank you
very much indeed.
Kind regards
