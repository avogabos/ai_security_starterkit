Hi Sarah,

 

Please can you chase this customer?

 

INTER CONTINENTAL TRADE LTD 

 

The registered address needs to be updated to 85 GPS and also the accounts
are due for filing by 31/01/2018 for the period ending 30/04/2017.

 

If the accounts are delivered late, he company itself will incur a financial
penalty. The penalty increases with period of delay, and there are no
exceptions because of a company's size, nature of business or trading
position. Where there is failure to comply with filing requirements in
consecutive years, the penalty will be doubled for the current year's
accounts.

 

Many  thanks!
