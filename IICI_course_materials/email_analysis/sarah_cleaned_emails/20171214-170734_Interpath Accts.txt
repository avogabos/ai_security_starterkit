Dear Gareth and partners,

 

I've looked at the history of the discussions and can see there are a lot of
changes and requests within a short time.

 

Our accounts team finish by 3pm each day as typically all filings are done
by 2pm on the day required. The accounts we filed had been approved by
yourselves and I understand that perhaps they weren't checked. I understand
this is sometimes the case.

 

The accounts you wanted to file are quite different to the ones from the
period before in terms of the headers and columns, micro entity accounts
merge these and as a result sometimes the totals do not quite reflect the
assets or shareholder funds. I understand however you would like all headers
to be unmerged and less abbreviated.

I can see from the accounts you prepared, there is a tax liability.

In the morning I will speak with our head of accounting again and check
before filing they will match in terms of assets and revenues what you wish
to show, and we will ask once more for an approval in our filing format, and
then file.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
