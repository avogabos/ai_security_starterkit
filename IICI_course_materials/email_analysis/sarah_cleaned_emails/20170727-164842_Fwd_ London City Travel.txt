Hello Sarah,
I just chatted with Athena and she suggested me to email you
sarah@formationshouse.com or to contact you on +44 203 823 6006
I called this number on 18 July and somebody told me to call a couple of
days later.
I wrote an email to Felix Almeida (he seems no more working in FH) and I
received the attached answer  from Mr. Elliot B. (I tried to call him today
but nobody connect me to him ).
I called the phone number to talk you , but you were not available.
I received  a few weeks ago an email from FH regarding services expiring
soon, but how can I do it if the website is down ? I received another email
from support with attached letters from HMRC.
By the way I forgot my ID number to login in FH "My account".
Sarah, how can we solve  everything ? Do you have a direct phonenumber
otherwise by writing it is a waste of time.
I suppose  you have my name in a file: Alberto Ferrari
Sorry for my english.
ciao from Italy
