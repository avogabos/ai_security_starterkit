                      Your Life With Love!
It is freezing cold here 
                      in New York and we are waiting for the Groundhog to predict 
                      the weather in our favor on the popular
Groundhog 
                      Day
. Life has come to a standstill. I use the time to 
                      visit friends and folks and read as much as I can. I am 
                      lately enjoying capturing images on my DSLR gifted by Aaliyah.
Remember my friend Kim who 
                      is
recovering 
                      from a break-up
since the eve of New Year?
I thought of paying a visit 
                      to her place and check on her well-being. I was surprised 
                      to find a note on her door addressed to me.
“
Hey, Bob! I was 
                      feeling claustrophobic in here and decided to hit the road 
                      alone. Yes I am kind of doing the moonlight flit. I know 
                      you will worry about me but please don’t, I will get 
                      back to you soon
.”
I tried calling her but 
                      every time I got the voicemail. I left a message for her 
                      and realized that to find her way back to the society she 
                      has to go through her own self.
