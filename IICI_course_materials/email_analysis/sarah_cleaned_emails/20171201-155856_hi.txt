Oliver [2:28 PM] 

for Interpath he has one questiion

 

 

[2:28] 

when you do the confirmation statement can you put a company name change was
done just after the last acccounts went in (July1st 2016)?

Also can you remove you director or add Andrew Clark from July 1st 2016?

 

 

charlotte-1852 [2:28 PM] 

thats not a field in the conformation statement

 

 

[2:29] 

you can amend the appointment date for a director

 

 

Oliver [2:29 PM] 

i think changing director in previous dates are not possible, as the bank
account is opened in that name as signatory

 

 

charlotte-1852 [2:29 PM] 

then file the conormaiton statement after

 

 

[2:29] 

if it wasnt already filed for that period

 

 

[2:29] 

doesnt matter

 

 

[2:29] 

the bank wont check that but will want to ensure whoever is current has
access

 

 

Oliver [2:30 PM] 

so we change director in back dates, file CS, and then inform bank that
director is changed

 

 

charlotte-1852 [2:30 PM] 

yes

 

 

Oliver [2:30 PM] 

ok

 

 

[2:31] 

do we need to terminate our own director also on the back date after
appointing new one

 

 

charlotte-1852 [2:33 PM] 

yes

 

 

[2:33] 

we should

 

 

Oliver [3:33 PM] 

who will inform the bank, that director was changed back in 2016, and we are
informing them now

 

 

[3:33] 

doesnt it looks suspicious

 

 

charlotte-1852 [3:33 PM] 

its fine

 

 

Oliver [3:34 PM] 

the cus will inform the bank or we do it

 

 

[3:38] 

there will be technical issue, as the last confirmation statement was filed
in June 2017, as our Director

 

[3:38] 

how can we backdate the change of director and file a new confirmation
statement

 

 

[3:38] 

it will contradict

 

 

[3:39] 

we can simple tell him that we can backdate only till June 2017 and then
file a confirmation statement, and he then take over the company and infiorm
bank

 

 

[3:40] 

we can appoint him Director in June 2017

 

 

[3:40] 

then file CS

 

 

[3:40] 

ok ?

 

 

charlotte-1852 [3:43 PM] 

will say the new director  took over but didnt take over bank yet as still
novating the business

 

 

[3:43] 

you can still do that

 

 

[3:43] 

it might conflict but we can state was admn error

 

 

[3:43] 

file from june

 

 

Oliver [3:43 PM] 

Ok, so we make his appointment in backdate, then take off our director and
then file CS 

 

[3:43] 

Ok, thanks

 

 

[3:44] 

we will do that now

 

 

[3:45] 

he wants his appointment to be done in 2016

 

 

[3:46] 

but the CS filed in june 2017 only show our Director as the only director of
the company

 

 

[3:46] 

i dont know, its complicated

 

 

new messages

[3:46] 

now whatever you decide

 

 

charlotte-1852 [3:50 PM] 

if the system lets us file a backdated appointment its fine, and can tick he
is pcs

 

 

[3:50] 

the new CS01 file will then have him in addition

 

 

[3:50] 

it will be fine
