Hi Charlotte, 

 

Company Name: KNOWLEDGE MEDIA LTD (GBP 10,000 + vat)

Managed Company (GBP 3500 + vat)

Pls confirm below ; I told her that that they can apply for a pre-pay card
and request us to top that card up from the managed account.

Dear Sarah, 

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please advise if the client used your managed company service, how could he
be able to apply the pre-paid card of the company?

 

Kindly confirm is the company with the HSBC bank account able to apply a
credit/debit/prepaid card? Not applying one for the director but one for the
company.

 

 

Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,

Scottie Liu
