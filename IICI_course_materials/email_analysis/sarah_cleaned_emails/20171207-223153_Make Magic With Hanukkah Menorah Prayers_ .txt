Make Magic With Hanukkah Memorah Prayers!
“May the lights of Hanukkah usher in a better world for all humankind.” ~ Anonymous
Hanukkah,
the Jewish festival of lights. The festival commemorates the re-dedication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century BCE. It is an eight day long festival where Jews all around the globe celebrate by exchanging greetings, playing games, eating traditional food like potato latkes and doughnuts (sufganiyot) along with main course of Brisket. Draped in blue and white dresses and prayer shawls they celebrate with a ritual which is very close to my heart,of lighting of a menorah, or eight-branched candelabra, to recall the miracle of oil found in the temple. The oil was only enough for one day, but it burned for eight.
My neighbor is lighting the menorah and me and Aaliyah will be joining them during the prayers and festivities. We are believers. The first night he lights only the shammus(the one at a different height) and with it he lights one Chanukkah candle, one candle is added to the menorah each night. By eighth night we light all candles.
