Dear Oliver,

 

The banks we deal with can be found at : 

https://www.offshorecorpserve.com/index.php/en/our-services/bank-account

 

After initial evaluation of every client's background and requirements, we
can then ascertain which bank(s) are suitable and we can try apply with
those banks. 

 

All banks have their own list of high risk/ sanctioned countries. These are
countries where if the client's business or remittances are involved, the
bank will not even consider their bank application. 

Hence, we will need to understand the following before recommending.

 

*	which countries will be involved in incoming/outgoing remittances,
*	business nature
*	country where company is incorporated
*	countries businesses will be conducted
*	nationality of UBOs (Ultimate Beneficiary Owners)
*	and any other questions posed by the bank. 

 

 

As for required personal/ business documents, generally these are required.

*	Certificate of Incorporation
*	Certificate of Incumbency  
*	Memorandum & Articles of Association 
*	Register of Directors
*	Register of Members
*	Organogram of the company (if any)
*	Passport copy
*	Proof of residential address less than 3 months (Do not accept
TV/Mobile phone bill. Driving license/ Utility bill/ Bank statement/ Bank
reference letter. Full physical address must be seen.)
*	CV
*	Business Plan
*	Bank reference letter 

 

Do note that all banks may ask for additional information/ documents. Some
banks do not require bank reference letter or may request for 2 bank
reference letters.

Granting of bank account opening is also subject to banks' discretion. 

 

As for time, it should take 2 weeks or lesser. Sometimes, it can take longer
than that as it depending on how soon we get the complete notarised
documents, application forms signed, and turnaround time by the bank and
client.  

 

Let me know if you need further clarifications. Thank you.

 

 

 

With Regards,

 

Wai Meng Choo

Offshore CorpServe Pte. Ltd.
