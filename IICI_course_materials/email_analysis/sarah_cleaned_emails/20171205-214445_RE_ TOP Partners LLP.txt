Dear Mr Tinák,

 

It was a pleasure to meet with Mr’s Bojkovsky this morning and discuss all the requirements.

 

Process

1.	Appoint Mr Adam Bojkovsky to UK Readymade Company – 1 working day
2.	Incorporate 2 BVI companies (Company Reg no. issued in 3 working days)
3.	Appoint LTD & 2 BVI as partners in LLP – 3 working days
4.	Process bank Account Opening for BVI’s – typically 10 working days
5.	Provide Documents needed to client for LLP and LTD bank account. – next day from process 3


Mr Adam Bojkovsky selected EUROPEAN SOLVE LTD formed in 2014. However, this company has already been sold. We will provide  ADVANCED CENTRE LTD or any other company formed in 2014. Please confirm.

 

For the  process 1 -3 we shall require the ID documents for 3 persons.

For process 4 it is likely we shall require the notarised ID for 2 persons (Mr Bojkovsky & Mr Tinák)

ID should be clear colour scan of passport and proof of address such as bank statement dated within 3 months.

 

We shall check the availability of names in BVI for Green Servis Consulting Ltd and Lutin Corp Ltd (and offer similar alternatives if not available)

For the UK company, we do not think it necessary to appoint a UK based director at this time as I believe with the correct ID Mr Bojkovsky (jr) should be able to open an account at Barclays if not the ANZ branch  in UK for the business. 

 

Please let us know when you will make a payment, and we shall prepare the partnership Agreement for the LLP when we appoint the new partners, confirming which are the nominated (UK LTD and Mr Tinák BVI) and the designated partner as (Mr Bojkovsky (Sr) BVI).

 

If in the future you wish to draft and file a custom partnership agreement we will be happy to assist you.

 

To confirm if you require any further information relating to the technical delivery of this solution please feel free to email Charlotte directly at  <mailto:charlotte@formationshouse.com> charlotte@formationshouse.com or msg at 44 7788883680. All other enquires, please email me.

 

 

Kind Regards,
