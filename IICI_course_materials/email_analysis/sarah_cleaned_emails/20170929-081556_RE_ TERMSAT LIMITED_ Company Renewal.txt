Dear Nellianne,

Please note that the previous payment(GBP 130) is for GOOD STANDING Certificate which cannot be issued until the company is RENEWED and is in good standing. Therefore, a second payment of GBP 155 has been made for company renewal. You can utilize the payments for renewal and good standing certificate issuance,.

I have explained it to you in my previous email. Please check and advice if the you have received the 2nd payment?

Regards,

Sarah
