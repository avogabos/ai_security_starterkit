Dear Shaun, dear Sarah,

Mrs. Saveriadou has only recently moved to the new address.  We shall proceed in updating the company’s house records the soonest .

Regarding the PSC persons in FAITH MARINE please note that this was only mentioned in the AnnuaL return during the Administrative restoration. We need the authorization codes of FAITH MARINE to urgently file a revised PSC with the correct person ( which is one physical )

We cannot provide you the details of Mr. Paul  Andy William – nor the FIDES SECRETARIES – as they are not the PSC !!

We will of course provide you with the details of the correct PSC person, once we file the Amended and correct PSC


Please help us get the authentication codes the soonest as both companies must file accounts !!


Thanking you in advance,


Kindest Regards,

Maria Mita Nicolaou
