Dear Rachel,

 

thank you for talking to me just now.

 

As you had asked me, I am writing an email to you with the request to pass
this on to management.

 

As discussed, the exact timing of the change of address has significant
consequences for any business including mine.

I had been told the address changes on the 18th of August or earlier
(possibly the 12th). This has not happened.

 

It is not a matter of just having mail forwarded from a different address,
it is not only a national issue, where, as soon 

as Companieshouse has changed the address, I can inform my partners and all
is fine.

 

I have the urgent need to register for tax in other countries outside
Europe. And I cannot register there with an address, and a week

later tell the foreign tax office the address is changing. People will
wonder, I would. It is not professional.

 

So, I really need to know the date of the change of address for Sleex Ltd
and Sleex USA Ltd. I cannot live with "we will

let you know when it has happened". There are too big consequences.

 

So I need your help. Please clarify whether the address change will likely
be in one month time or in one week's time.

 

Many thanks for getting back to me as quickly as possible.

 

Best regards

Corinna
