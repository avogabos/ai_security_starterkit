Sarah,

I have tried to initiate the issue of new shares but the system just says “failed to load information.

We need to issue additional shares to Mr Victor F Keen to take his total shareholding to 172 shares (69 additional shares) Can you please provide the required documents and further confirm the cost to affect this change.

Kind Regards,
Richard Chamberlain
