Dear Support, 

I would like to ask about our company Freewill Consulting Ltd.

We have found a mistake in the balance sheet that we provided for the Value
accounting service for the previous accounting period ended 30 June 2016,
based on which tax return was made and thus the corporation tax had been
calcuted wrong. Is there a possibility to file an additional tax return or
corrected tax return or something similar to make it right?

 

Thank you

 

Sincerely,

Petr Lein
