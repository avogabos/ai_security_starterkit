The account is in London

 

We need to understand if what you mean is you wish for a nominee to be
appointed in order to change the name and then for the company to actually
operate, as we call this a Managed Company, in which case the existing
director will stay in place, do a name change, and then take instruction on
making payments on the owners behalf,

The fee is dependent upon the intending activity and level of transactions
but typically from the information we know so far we would charge 4500 for
one year, the company can then operate with the existing director in place,
under a new name and following instructions from the BO until they are able
to formally take over the company

Dear Sarah, 

 

As the client can't make the trip to UK within the month but he worries the
new name might be used before his arrival. 

 

Can you provide nominee service to take over the company and bank account
and change the company name for the client first? 

 

Please advise your fee quotation and requirements if you could assist.

 

Kindly advise if hitch city is the bank account at? London?

 

 

Thank you.

 

Best regards,

Scottie Liu
