Good morning Sarah

I have been given your details as I am looking to purchase an off the shelf
company with the relevant financials with merely to save time.

I have been briefly on your site and see a number of companies that would
be suitable for which I am willing to pay the going rate for such companies
of £4,000.

One of the companies of interest to me is interpath Ltd, please come back
to me asap as I have another of other agents providing me with suitable
companies.

Kind regards
