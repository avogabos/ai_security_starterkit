Dear Lewis, 

 

RE:  PRC  - CHINESE EMBASSY LEGALISATION 

 

I believe my colleague Sarah, your account manager, has already emailed your team about this, regarding the fact we need a new authorisation letter?

 

We require a new authorisation letter as Darius Khan is unable to go to the PRC Embassy it will be Danielle Ardern going we cannot process it without the amended authorisation letter. Also the wording is incorrect it should be AC ONLINE LTD trading as Formations House 

 

Please see below correct wording.

 

I, …………………………..., Director of Pros Energy International Limited do hereby entrust our agent, AC ONLINE LTD (trading name of Formations House), to act on our behalf and Danielle Ardern, who is acting as representative agent for Formations House to submit the application on our behalf for the legalisation process. 

 

Yours Sincerely, 

 

*Signature*

 

Name: 

Director of Pros Energy International Limited 

 

 

Please kindly provide to us as soon as possible. We will need the original letter posted out to us.

Subject: RE: Pros Energy International Limited - ROC Legalization Query

 

Dear Lewis, 

 

Please see attached notarised and apostilled documents. The document “IN01” is called – Application to register a company.

 

The documents are now ready to go to the PRC Embassy we are waiting for your instruction to proceed. Please advise what you would like to do?

 

From my understanding you want the same documents to be legalised BOTH at PRC and ROC? OR you would like another set of documents legalisation at ROC? 

 

Once established I can issue another Invoice. 

 

Kind regards

Dear Lewis, 

 

Please accept my apologies! I was a little confused, regarding Republic of China and Peoples Republic of China. 

 

It is the Taiwan Embassy that you require legalisation from? 

 

The cost is the same however the process is a little different. 

 

Please kindly fill out the form (link below) and have the client sign. The signature must be notarised as genuine by UK/Taiwan notary public or R.O.C. overseas missions.

Once done please kindly scan and email back and I will give you the correct address to send the original too. 

 

Once again sincere apologies. 

 

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest conviencne.

Dear Lewis,
RE:  PRC  - CHINESE EMBASSY LEGALISATION
I believe my colleague Sarah, your account manager, has already emailed your team about this, regarding the fact we need a new authorisation letter?
We require a new authorisation letter as Darius Khan is unable to go to the PRC Embassy it will be
Danielle Ardern
going
we cannot process it without the amended authorisation letter. Also the wording is incorrect it should be
AC ONLINE LTD trading as Formations House
Please see below correct wording.
I,
…………………………
..., Director of Pros Energy International Limited do hereby entrust our agent,
AC ONLINE LTD (trading name of Formations House),
to act on our behalf and
Danielle Ardern
,
who is acting as representative agent for Formations House to submit the application on our behalf for the legalisation process.
Yours Sincerely,
*Signature*
Name:
Director of Pros Energy International Limited
Please kindly provide to us as soon as possible.
We will need the original letter posted out to us.

RE: Pros Energy International Limited - ROC Legalization Query
Dear Lewis,
Please see attached notarised and apostilled documents. The document “IN01” is called – Application to register a company.
The documents are now ready to go to the PRC Embassy we are waiting for your instruction to proceed. Please advise what you would like to do?
From my understanding you want the same documents to be legalised BOTH at PRC and ROC? OR you would like another set of documents legalisation at ROC?
Once established I can issue another Invoice.
Kind regards

RE: Pros Energy International Limited - ROC Legalization Query
Dear Lewis,
Please accept my apologies! I was a little confused, regarding Republic of China and Peoples Republic of China.
It is the Taiwan Embassy that you require legalisation from?
The cost is the same however the process is a little different.
Please kindly fill out the form (link below) and have the client sign. The signature must be notarised as genuine by UK/Taiwan notary public or R.O.C. overseas missions.
http://www.taiwanembassy.org/uploads/sites/172/2015/10/Letter-of-Authorisation.pdf
Once done please kindly scan and email back and I will give you the correct address to send the original too.
Once again sincere apologies.
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest conviencne.
