What Everybody Ought To Know About Old Friends!
Cherish the friends that make tomorrow better than yesterday! ~Editor Bob
Blueberry, chocolate or caramel? Aaliyah bellowed from the kitchen as she pondered over a list of ingredients needed for baking a cheesecake.
Blueberry, I said as I entered the kitchen.
Adding the last few elements to her list, Aaliyah folded the paper, grabbed her purse and we were out of the door. We were on a mission to bake the best
cheesecake
in town.
For many days now, Adrian, Donna, Kate, Megan, Steve, Aaliyah and I had been planning to have a dessert rendezvous to beat the
summer
heat. Each of us had decided what we were bringing to a dessert potluck at our home and we were making a cheesecake!
Within 30 minutes, we had picked up all the necessary ingredients and were back home. We both immediately jumped into action, beating the cream cheese, whisking the eggs and blending all the ingredients together. Once in the oven, Aaliyahs eyes kept darting to see how it was coming along.
When the oven ring went off, she ran towards it. Her eyes gleaming, she took it out of the oven, satisfied, relieved and ecstatic about what we had been able to create. It took a lot of willpower to not devour it immediately.
Next day, our house was buzzing with people and the smell of delicious desserts. As everyone began placing their creations on the table, Aaliyah went to take hers out of the fridge as well. While walking, she tripped and the whole cake went smashing on the floor.
Her face fell, she was devastated. All the effort and
love
she had put in the day before, had come down to nothing. What happened next was surprising and wonderful at the same time.
