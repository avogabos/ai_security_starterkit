Dear Sarah,



as my email of the 11th September, I confirm that the SIC code of the
company is the same as last year (82990 - Other business support service
activities not elsewhere classified).



The PSC is the Director Mr. GEORG GERHARD RODE.



The Shareholder is Mrs. MARITA METTNER holding 1000 Shares of GBP 1 each.


Remember that Mr. Ghezzi Paolo is not more Director of the company, he has
given up his resignation in the year 2015.



Thanks for your attention and help.



Regards,



Aldo Zezza
