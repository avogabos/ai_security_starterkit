Dear Sarah,

Please advise is the a certificate of incumbency of the UK company required for the bank’s requirement at change owner and change of company name, one for each? What is your fee quotation for the certificate?

The customer is planning to purchase the company first and use your service to file all information on-line and also change the company name afterward. Is it OK to do all the filings now including the change of the company name and the customer comes to UK in September for taking over the bank account? Or the bank account must be updated within a certain period of time after the company is acquired by the customer? Maybe only proceed the whole process a little bit earlier before the customer’s arrival to UK?

Please advise.


Thank you.

Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact us.

Dear Scottie,

Thank you for your email.

Please note that Company Name Change service is for GBP 50 & the name will be changed in 3-4 working days. Kindly provide us the new name so that I may check the availability.

Also note that the name change will be done after the company and bank account are fully transferred to the new director as this will delay the entire process.

The name change application will be submitted online to Companies House and the New Name will then be updated on Bank Account records.

Dear Scottie,

Thank you for your email.

Please note that the company your client is interested in purchasing is a previously trading company. The accounts for Corporate App show small trading turnover with no profit, which is the case.

The company Corporate App had a loan which completed in 2015, its completely satisfied and we will provide a letter to confirm. The credit report is also clean and all taxes etc are up to date

Purchasing a company that has an existing bank account with absolutely no prior trading or business activity is rather uncommon, as banks tend not to open accounts for non-trading companies or for the purpose of being sold on unused.

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

: UK Company Shelflist ::REMINDER::
Dear Sarah,
Thank you for your email.
Does the company director have to present at the bank for the change of account name process? Or the client can sign everything regarding the change of name at the bank first then you can
 submit the required documents after the change of company name filing is done?
Thank you.
Best regards ,
Scottie Liu

Dear Scottie,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that Company Name Change service is for GBP 50 & the name will be changed in 3-4 working days. Kindly provide us the new name so that I may check
 the availability.
Also note that the name change will be done after the company and bank account are fully transferred to the new director as this will delay the entire process.
The name change application will be submitted online to Companies House and the New Name will then be updated on Bank Account records.
Regards,
Sarah

One last question before the client confirm to proceed.
The client would like to change the company name after take over and he likes to pay the fees altogether and arrange Chang of the company name at the bank when he is in UK at once.
Kindly advise the fee for the change of UK company name and if you could arrange the change of account name together when the client is in UK taking over the bank account?
Thank you.

Dear Scottie,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that the company your client is interested in purchasing is a previously trading company. The accounts for Corporate App show small trading turnover
 with no profit, which is the case.
The company Corporate App had a loan which completed in 2015, its completely satisfied and we will provide a letter to confirm. The credit report is also
 clean and all taxes etc are up to date
Purchasing a company that has an existing bank account with absolutely no prior trading or business activity is rather uncommon, as banks tend not to open
 accounts for non-trading companies or for the purpose of being sold on unused.
I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
We look forward to hearing from you soon.
