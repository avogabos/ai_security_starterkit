Dear All Customers,

 

Firstly Formations House would like to apologise for the major disruptions caused during our planned move out of our office in 29 Harley Street. We appreciate the impact this may have had on your business and we appreciate the patience and support we have received from many of you.

 

We are pleased to announce that we have moved into our new premises at 22 Harley Place, London W1G 8LZ.

 

We still cannot confirm our exact service address for the registered address and mailing address service, as we are in negotiations with two other service providers to partner with them permanently to ensure that should we ever need to move again your address services will remain unaffected and continuous. The reason for the delay in confirming the address is due to legal compliance requirements and sourcing the best long term option as an address partner that will have little to no impact on our existing customers compliance and costs.

 

Please do note that we continue to collect all mail items from 29 Harley Street.

 

We intend to finalise and provide the address for registered offices and virtual mailing address by the end of next week, and we will make the arrangements with Companies House to move the registered office addresses, and with HMRC for the companies to which we providing accounting services.

 

All existing Registered Address customers will receive a 2 year price freeze for their service, and we shall offer alternative addresses for use at optional premiums. New customers and new companies ordered by existing customers may be subject to a price increase of our existing �100 per annum fee for Registered Address.

 

All existing Mailing Address customers will receive a 1 year price freeze for their service, and we shall offer alternative addresses for use at optional premiums. New customers and new companies ordered by existing customer may be subject to a price increase which will be dependent on the selected Mailing Address location, as multiple options will be offered.

 

We are aware the Virtual Telephone Service is still not reactivated and this is a technical issue we are resolving with BT due to the move of our servers from the old building to our new datacentre. We hope to have all numbers including the Formations House service numbers active again within 2 weeks but please do bear with us and we shall contact individual customers to handle customer service issues they may be facing.

 

Our new office has a customer waiting reception area and a private meeting space to enable us to provide professional consulting at our office. We unfortunately cannot provide a meeting space for rent by the hour, however we can refer you to a number of other meeting room space providers depending on the location of preference.

 

Please feel free to come and see us, whether it’s to drop by and say hello or if you need some time to discuss your business with one of our consultants. Contact our support team to let us know when you would like to visit.

 

The new office is available Monday to Friday (working days) 9am until 5pm. 

 

Many thanks for your continued custom.
