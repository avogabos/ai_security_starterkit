Dear Peter,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that we have verified Andrew Peter Clark's id
document; you need to provide your due diligence documents as a reseller.
we are regulated under HMRC policy for Money Laundering
Regulations, as we are a business services provider. To maintain this they
expect a high level of compliance in how we address the Know Your Customer
policy. Therefore, as a reseller you are required to please provide us your due
diligence documents. We will require the following documents:
-Passport Copy
-Proof of address(dated within last 3 months)
-MLR number (if MLR registered in UK)
-Brief description of business activity
Also, we will need to see the cleared funds in our account and
then we can process the appointment to Companies House. Kindly make the payment
in our account. The revised invoice is attached.
Once the appointment will show on Companies House website, we
let you know, we are currently checking whether our director needs to be
present or can simply sign the form in advance.
The nominee director for this is in on Thursday, and can meet at
the Tottenham court road branch easily.
This should provide enough time for the appointment processing
for the director to be completed.
I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further
information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
We look forward to hear from you soon.
Best Regards,
Sarah

Dear
Peter,
Thank you for your email.
Please
confirm the Name of the company you have finalized so that I may advise
accordingly.
Also,
we will do the appointments and termination and file Confirmation Statement
accordingly.  We can change the name of the company; the cost of the
service is GBP 25 +  VAT. We  will contact Companies House to check
if it is possible to back date the name change.
Also
advise if Andrew Peter Clark is the sole director, shareholder and PSC officer
in the RM Company?
We
look forward to hear from you.
