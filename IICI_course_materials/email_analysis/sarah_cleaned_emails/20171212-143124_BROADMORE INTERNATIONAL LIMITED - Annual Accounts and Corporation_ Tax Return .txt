Dear Sarah,

I tried unsuccessfully to pay for the value accounting service online as per the instructions provided below. Do you think you can just help me pay for it by sending you the card credentials as we sometimes do?

The card details are as follows:

Address: Drake Chambers, P.O. Box 3321, Road town, Tortola, British Virgin Island

Thank you
