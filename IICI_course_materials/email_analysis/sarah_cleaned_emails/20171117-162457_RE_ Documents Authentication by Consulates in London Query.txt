Subject: RE: Documents Authentication by Consulates in London Query

Hi Sarah! 

 

So this seems very tricky, it would be better for us to find out for what
reason they need this type of legalisation and then we would be able to
advise better. I can say that it would not be in one set, ID documents and
corporate documents are normally in different sets. 

 

Why does it need to be legalised in London? For instance we can get the
Certificate of Incorporation from Seychelles apostille and then it can be
stamped by the Chinese Embassy in Seychelles - this more realistic. 

 

I'm currently emailing an International Notary to see if this is possible to
get a Seychelles document notarised in London, I know that our regular
notary that we use would not do this. 

 

Below will not be possible unless the person is physically present in London
with the original documents. What will the nationality be?

Copy of POA

Copy of the passport of the Director

 

Please see what I have taken from the Chinese Embassy in London. 

Sept One: If your documents were not issued by a British government
authority, please send them to a local international notary public for
notarisation. 




Step Two: Send the documents, notarised by notaries, to the Legalization
office of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) or an authorised
department by FCO for legalizations. If the documents were issued by a
British government department, you may send them for legalizations to FCO or
an authorised department by FCO. 




Step Three: After completing the initial stage of notarisation and
legalization, submit the documents to the Chinese embassy or consulates for
legalization.
