Refund processing now

 

We will need to see the cleared funds in our account and then we can process the appointment to companies house

Once its showing on their site, we let you know, we are currently checking whether our director needs to be present or can simply sign the form in advance.

The nominee director for this is in on Thursday, and can meet at the Tottenham court road branch easily.

 

This should provide enough time for the appointment processing for the director to be completed

thanks

Hi,

 

Bank Account details for ITS Natwest 60-17-21 acc numb 99159686 

 

please let me know when this is done.

 

As to vat number you as to our conversation which I relayed to others was that you would apply for vat number free for us and as such I can only pay your

original invoice.

 

Andrew Peter Clark’s is to be the sole director, shareholder and PSC officer in the company.

 

Once he is appointed and is added as a director in Bank Account; we will then remove our director and back date the termination   - ok

We cannot provide online login as it’s tied to the current director; the new director will receive his own login after he is added- ok

 

if we can do tomorrow at 2pm Andy will go in to the branch. Will he meet someone from your company or go alone ? 

I will get docs over to you as required
