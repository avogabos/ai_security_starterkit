10 Ways To Detoxify Your Mind!
Today, the blankness of the paper is mirroring my mind. I just got up from my meditation and reading regime. Aaliyah has replaced my morning cup of Java with celery and cucumber juice. She is obsessed with detoxifying our diet and nutrition these days. She has mastered making smoothies, which is not so smooth by the way. My friends are dreading coming to the house for Black Friday Weekend because instead of chilled beer, they will be consuming veggies and crushed grass. Aaliyah is on the wagon and encourages us all to give up alcohol.
However, I am on another kind of detox lately. I am cleaning my mind of all the beliefs, unfinished business, grudges, unrealized dreams, so on and so forth. You must be wondering about my plan for mental detoxification?
Here it is! I believe the only thing that is fairly in our control is our thoughts. This mental chatter is what holds the steering wheel of our life. So, I like to dust my mind and get rid of the traces of negativity.
