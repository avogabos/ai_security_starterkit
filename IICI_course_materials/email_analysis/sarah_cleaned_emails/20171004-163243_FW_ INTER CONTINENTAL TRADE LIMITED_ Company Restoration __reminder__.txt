Hello Sarah,

 

I see as per the Annual accounts and on the restoration pages, that the
1000000 GBP shares are mentioned. However it must be clear that one million
GBP have never been paid into the company at any time. Only one of those
shares has been issued and Mr. Kristjan Snorri Ingolfsson is the holder of
that one share. So the million is not actually available nor has it ever
been.

o   C2 do we need to tick a box here? The company has never been traded on
an open market.

-          Part 5

§  F2 Indiidual  Home address for Kristjan Snorri Ingolfsson is at Street:
Krokavad 11, City: Reykjavik Pstcode: 110, Iceland

§  F3 The PSC individual has 75% or more control

§  F1 on the 2nd person on PCF particulars: Eyjolfur Vestmann Ingolfsson,
Date of birth: 11 OCT 1977, note that Ingolfsson is the surname, Eyjolfur
Vestmann are the forenames

§  F2 DOB: 11 OCT 1977 for Eyjolfur Vestmann Intolfsson

§  F3 PSC individual should have the right to exercise significant influence
or control over the company

 

 

Can you update this information and resend me the form so that I may sign
and return it to you?

 

Can you advise how long it will take after the documents have been
submitted, for the company to be fully restored again so that we may
unfreeze the bank accounts as well.

 

Many thanks and

Best regards,

Eyjolfur V. Ingolfsson (Eyvi)

Hi Sarah,

 

Do I need to fill out any additional information on the pages or are the
forms completed and ready for signature? I see that one of the files is 62
pages long, Im not an expert at these things and I do not want to make any
mistakes. Can you advise?

 

Many thanks and

Best regards,

Eyvi.
