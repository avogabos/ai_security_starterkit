Dear Rachael

 

i have received the two forms before, from Sarah. 

 

i have informed Sarah that the Chinese notarization office can only provide
the notarization document in the standard format provided by Chinese
judicial department, as i provided.  the office can not use forms provided
by outsider.

 

please note that within the notarization documents of my passport and
electricity bill,  you can see the translation done by independent
translator company. 

 

please check the notarization documents again and explain this to the
registry.

 

 

Best Regards

 

Bo
