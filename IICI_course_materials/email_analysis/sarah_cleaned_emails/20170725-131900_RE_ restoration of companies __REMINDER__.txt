Dear Sarah,
Thank you for your e-mail, I was out of the office that is why I didn't reply earlier.
We do not require the service of Online Administrator - only registered office. Please send us your invoice so we can arrange payment.
Please also send us  the company's authorization codes as these are needed by the company's accountant to file the company's accounts.
Thanking you in advance and waiting for your feedback.
