Super Charge Your Love Life With Antia And Brody Boyd!
Love is the ability to hold your partner in the light and also in the shadow.~Antia Boyd
I interviewed a special couple who live in San Diego, fell in love in Hawaii and were about to renew their marital vows on their third wedding anniversary. Interestingly both of them have the same calling in life, they are the most sorted after love coach and support singles to find their perfect one and couples in strengthening the bond with their partners.
As I interacted with them online, they both seemed like Greek love god and goddess professing the prophecies of flawless love which accepts and transcends the flaws, which sees perfection in the imperfect. With Hug Week approaching I was in awe at how everything aligns when you want to do something meaningful in the lives of people who you connect with.
Importance Of Hugs And Touch In A Relationship
So, when I asked them about the significance of hugs and touch in a relationship, Antia stated that her first language of love is touch. She believes that touch creates the trust and comfort with the other person. You feel safe and there is the flow of the feel good hormone, oxytocin which allows you to deeply connect with your love.

Brody winked at her smilingly, We cuddle all the time as I believe it is part of the bond we share, just like it happens between a mother and the baby.
