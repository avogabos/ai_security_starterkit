U.K. Company with bank account
Hi, I am interested in buying a ready made U.K. Ltd. company with a bank account.
The reason is that I have a bad credit record and am worried that to open a ltd and a bank account by myself will not be easy.
Can you confirm I will not have the same problem when I buy a ready made company from you?
Will the bank account have a debit/credit card and internet banking access?
What price am I looking at for such a company?
Thanks
Robert
