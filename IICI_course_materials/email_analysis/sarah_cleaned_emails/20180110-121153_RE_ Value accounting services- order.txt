Subject: Value accounting services- order

 

Dear Support,

 

we have ordered the Value accounts service for the company HAGLLEY
CORPORATION LIMITED under the order no. 195016 (also see below). Please take
the amount of 300 GBP of our balance/credit - Haglley Corporation s.r.o., ID
595189.

 

Please, and order No. 195017 is mistake, because we received two e-mails
with different No., but for the same service: Value accounts service for the
company HAGLLEY CORPORATION LIMITED. Thank you very much for your
undestanding.

 

Best Regards
