The company provide investment management services on behalf of clients located in the UK, UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong. This involves us taking on the investment via our Asset Management Agreement and providing access to trust services. Funds would be received from UAE and the UK and turnover would be circa £2.3million GBP and the likely transaction size would be from £2,000 to £300,000. The asset types we manage include real estate including fractional units, royalty contracts, loan note contracts and other forms of investment contracts including unlisted shares.

Hope this helps and await your further advices.

Kind Regards,
Richard Chamberlain

Dear Customer,

Thank you for the email.

Please note that the cost of Bank Account opening service is GBP 500, and we would require the apostilled company documents  and notarised id for the UBOs; and a full breakdown of the business, trading countries and transaction sizes.

Initially it may be easier to let us know which Countries funds come in and out from and what the purpose of the transactions are and we will check with the bank any preliminary issues before taking a fee for our service.

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

We look forward to hear from you soon.

Best Regards,

Sarah.

I see on your new website that you offer a bank account opening service for ABC Bank in Mauritius. Would you be able to assist in a bank account application for my company Glenmuir International Limited?

If yes can you please confirm the costs and what is required for me to open an account.

Richard Chamberlain
