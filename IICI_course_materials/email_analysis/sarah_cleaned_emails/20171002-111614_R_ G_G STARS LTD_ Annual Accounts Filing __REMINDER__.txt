Dear Gabriele,

Thank you for your email.

You are requested to please provide me the payment proof that has been given
to you by the bank so that we may track the payment that you made for
company restoration as we have not yet received it.

 

Also find attached complete details of all your companies with DUE DATES of
filing Annual Accounts and Confirmation Statement. You can also view the
details online on Companies House website via the following link:

 

http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//wcframe?name=accessCompanyInfo
<http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/wcframe?name=accessCompanyInfo> 


We have an automated system and we send reminders by email to our clients
when the statutory submission are due. Account submission reminders are sent
to clients who have our accounting services.

Please note that we send reminders to all our clients for filing
Confirmation Statement. You must file it online from your account or FORWARD
ME THE REMINDER EMAIL AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE IT. The companies are striked
off by Companies House if the Confirmation Statement for a company is not
filed


Also, you must purchase VALUE ACCOUNTING service for all your companies for
this year so that our accountants may contact you when the Annual accounts
are due for submission and file it on time. Penalty is incurred on  a
company if Annual Accounts are not filed on time and also it is striked off.


 

The accounts submission  that have been delayed for the companies were due
to incomplete information as your clients did not provide the transaction
details and other relevant information that was required to process it and
hence the penalty was incurred.

 

The Annual Account for D.M.R.E. LTD will be overdue by the end of this month
(Next Accounts Due: 30/04/2017). You are requested to please order value
accounting services for the company and provide us the transaction details
in the attached file or confirm if we should file non trading dormant
accounts for the company

 

Regarding invoices, all the Formations House invoices(generated from 2014
till 2017) for your company are available online in your account. You can
find the name of the company and the services in the invoices when you will
view it in PDF format. Or you can provide me the name of the company and I
can email you the order numbers & invoices paid in 2017.


I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information
or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

RE: G&G STARS LTD : Company Restoration
Dear Gabriele,
Thank you for your email.
You are requested to please provide me the payment proof that has been given to you by the bank so that we may track the payment that you made for company restoration as we have not yet received it.
Also find attached complete details of all your companies with DUE DATES of filing Annual Accounts and Confirmation Statement. You can also view the details online on Companies House website via the following link:
http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//wcframe?name=accessCompanyInfo
We have an automated system and we send reminders by email to our clients when the statutory submission are due. Account submission reminders are sent to clients who have our accounting services.
Please note that we send reminders to all our clients for filing Confirmation Statement.
You must file it online from your account or FORWARD ME THE REMINDER EMAIL AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE IT
. The companies are striked off by Companies House if the Confirmation Statement for a company is not filed
Also, you must purchase VALUE ACCOUNTING service for all your companies for this year so that our accountants may contact you when the Annual accounts are due for submission and file it on time. Penalty is incurred on  a company if Annual Accounts are not filed on time and also it is striked off.
The accounts submission  that have been delayed for the companies were due to incomplete information as your clients did not provide the transaction details and other relevant information that was required to process it and hence the penalty was incurred.
The Annual Account for D.M.R.E. LTD will be overdue by the end of this month (Next Accounts Due: 30/04/2017). You are requested to please order value accounting services for the company and provide us the transaction details in the attached file or confirm if we should file non trading dormant accounts for the company
Regarding invoices, all the Formations House invoices(generated from 2014 till 2017) for your company are available online in your account. You can find the name of the company and the services in the invoices when you will view it in PDF format. Or you can provide me the name of the company and I can email you the order numbers & invoices paid in 2017.
I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
Looking forward to hear from you.

Sarah

Dear Sarah,
thank you for your email
About G&G, link that you sent me does not work.
Please, I prefer that you give me notices about restore directly.
Could you tell me notices regard to the end times of this restore?
Regard my invoices, I just entered in my private area but there are no invoices for 2017 payments (see receipts attached).
Could you send me invoices directly?
With the opportunity, I would like to verify with you about other companies position to pay penalties made (gems, pure, GRIDA,, ecc.) and avoid others.
With previous company with I have collaborated there ha ve never been any problems.
I would like to find a way to avoid paying penalties of any company.
I am waiting for your suggestion.
