Hi Sarah,

I have not heard back from you so assume the company has no Vat number as
previously advised and as such the amount of £6,000 plus vat for such a
company is
to much.

I am willing to conclude a quick sale on the amount offered of £4,500 but
make plus vat so the total amount being paid is £ 5,400, please advise so
we can conclude his sale quickly.

Regards

Good morning Sarah
I have been given your details as I am looking to purchase
an off the shelf company with the relevant financials with merely to save time.
I have been briefly on your site and see a number of
companies that would be suitable for which I am willing to pay the going rate
for such companies of £4,000.
One of the companies of interest to me is interpath Ltd,
please come back to me asap as I have another of other agents providing me with
suitable companies.
Kind regards
