Dont Give Up On Yourself!
“The night you 
                      gave up on her is the night she gave up on her too.”
While the Big Apple was 
                      all wintry white and crimson last week, rejoicing in the 
                      magic of
Christmas
and spirit of New Year’s eve, my friend Kim, was going 
                      through her darkest moments.
She was constantly being 
                      slighted by her boyfriend in the past months. Avoidance 
                      came with a host of excuses from work to folks and friends 
                      but ultimately on the eve of New Year’s eve he broke 
                      up with her. She only heard his first few words that left 
                      her lifeless, “We need to let go of this relationship,” 
                      he continued but the words did not matter, the lame reasons 
                      were of no importance to her. She felt her entire world 
                      crashing down in front of her eyes. She had given him a 
                      piece of her soul, she did not know how to move on. She 
                      was lost. He went on and on justifying himself but she knew 
                      she had become an embarrassment for him, her uncontrolled 
                      emotional outbursts and her growing weight made her undesirable 
                      to him.
He wasn’t ready to 
                      accept his relationships with her in front of his friends, 
                      always belittling it. She would also laugh it away despite 
                      of her heart’s warning she would play along with him 
                      on his terms.
Alas! The game was over. 
                      I met her on the first day of the year and was traumatized 
                      to see her underneath a heap of negativity and dismay. She’d 
                      lost her vivacity, her confidence and her laughter. Her 
                      smile was a pretence, she wasn’t herself.
I decided to make her well-being 
                      my goal and she needs to get back to a state of innate freedom 
                      physically, emotionally and mentally in
2018
.
I told her mustering all 
                      courage in my voice trying hard not to choke, “You 
                      treat this as a challenge that you can overcome or a catastrophe 
                      that has wrecked you, it’s your choice.”
