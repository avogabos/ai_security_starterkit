Dear
                  Mr Tinák,
It
                  was a pleasure to meet with Mr’s Bojkovsky this
                  morning and discuss all the
                  requirements.
Process
1.
Appoint
                  Mr Adam
                  Bojkovsky to UK Readymade Company – 1 working day
2.
Incorporate
                  2 BVI
                  companies (Company Reg no. issued in 3 working days)
3.
Appoint
                  LTD & 2
                  BVI as partners in LLP – 3 working days
4.
Process
                  bank
                  Account Opening for BVI’s – typically 10 working days
5.
Provide
                  Documents
                  needed to client for LLP and LTD bank account. – next
                  day from process 3
Mr Adam Bojkovsky selected EUROPEAN SOLVE LTD
                      formed in 2014. However,
                      this company has already been sold. We will
                      provide  ADVANCED CENTRE LTD
                      or any other company formed in 2014. Please
                      confirm.
For
                  the  process 1 -3 we shall require the ID documents
                  for 3 persons.
For
                  process 4 it is likely we shall require the notarised
                  ID for 2 persons (Mr
                  Bojkovsky & Mr Tinák)
ID
                  should be clear colour scan of passport and proof of
                  address such as bank
                  statement dated within 3 months.
We
                  shall check the availability of names in BVI for Green
                  Servis Consulting Ltd
                  and Lutin Corp Ltd (and offer similar alternatives if
                  not available)
For
                  the UK company, we do not think it necessary to
                  appoint a UK based director at
                  this time as I believe with the correct ID Mr
                  Bojkovsky (jr) should be able to
                  open an account at Barclays if not the ANZ branch  in
                  UK for the business.
Please
                  let us know when you will make a payment, and we shall
                  prepare the partnership
                  Agreement for the LLP when we appoint the new
                  partners, confirming which are
                  the nominated (UK LTD and Mr Tinák BVI) and the
                  designated partner as (Mr
                  Bojkovsky (Sr) BVI).
If
                  in the future you wish to draft and file a custom
                  partnership agreement we will
                  be happy to assist you.
