Faith Over Fear!
“Fear is the inner demon and you can defeat it.” – Editor Bob
As
Autumn
unfurls, leaves turn rusty and tan, old gives way to the new. Change is never comfortable, is it? It is accompanied by fear, anxiety and resistance. But it is all that is constant in the course of life. We have been talking about
decluttering
inside out in 21 days this Fall. Today is Day 17. It is important to set our hearts free from fear which stifles our existence and inhibits our growth.
Have you ever wondered what your biggest fear is in life? What do you do to deal with it?  The best way to overcome it is to inculcate faith and live in hope. In times of affliction, keep calm and endure with patience. When you can’t see the road ahead, pray with all your heart. Pray to surrender and not to grab or want feverishly. This is the only way forward.
