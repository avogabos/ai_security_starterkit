Dear Sarah,

I hope that money came on your bank account alright for invoice TOPL2337 
(amount £13,990).

I confirm that Mr Adam Bojkovsky will be appointed as the sole director, 
shareholder and PSC officer in the company and provide us the SIC code 
for the company so that we may process the order accordingly.

Best regards.
