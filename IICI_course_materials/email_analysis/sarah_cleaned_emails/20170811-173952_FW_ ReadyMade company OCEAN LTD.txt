Hi Rachel,

 

Do the copies of the passport/ID and proof of address need to be notarised?

Hi Rachel,

 

Chris Hagan asked me to get in touch with you regarding Readymade company OCEAN LTD.  

 

Could you please send me all the identification documents required for directors & shareholders in the company?

 

Also, are there any age requirements for shareholders? One of the intended shareholders is 15 but turns 16 in three weeks. 

 

Thanks 

 

Sid
