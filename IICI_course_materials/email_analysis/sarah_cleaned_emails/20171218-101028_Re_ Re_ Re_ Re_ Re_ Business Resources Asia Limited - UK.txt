Dear Sir/Madam,

We would like to CANCEL the previous accounts filing order for Business
Resources Asia Limited. Please file the accounts as a NON-TRADING AND
DORMANT company. The conversion from Total Exemption Small to Dormant
Accounts has cost GBP 360 and we already paid 600 GBP. The REMAINING GBP
240 can be used for Registered Address fee(GBP 120) and Wallet charge (GBP
18). The last REMAINING GBP 102 shall be used for our next payment.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,






Asami Yamada
