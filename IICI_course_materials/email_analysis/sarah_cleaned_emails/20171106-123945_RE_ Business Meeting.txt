Hi Sarah, 

 

We have moved from 29 Harley street! ! 

 

to 22 HARLEY PLACE, W1G 8LZ 

 

meeting room hire is 35 + vat per hour 

 

can accommodate 6 people comfortably.

 

You will need to find out how many people and for how long they would like it for. It would be best if we can take the payment in advance 

 

Many thanks!
