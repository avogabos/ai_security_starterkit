Dear Karim,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that you do not need to have any accounting for the Seychelles Company as it doesn’t have to file accounting.
You will be required to file returns which we will file along with company renewal; the cost of the service is GBP 100 + VAT.
Regarding administration of company; please note that you may purchase the Online Company Administration for the company. This service will allow you to do appointments and terminations in the company. However, you will be require to download and sign the forms once it is submitted and is available online. The signed forms and resolutions will be submitted to the Registered Agents in Seychelles for updating the company records.
Regards,
Sarah
Formations House
