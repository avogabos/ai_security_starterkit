Dear Sirs/Madam,

Thank you very much for your reply.

I have advised the Director to approve the email to activate the
domain and email account.

As regards the Email Account, in your previous email also, you had
mentioned about the attachment only and not about the size of email
account.
"3- Normally there is no limit on the size of attachment."
We would like to know how much capacity for each email ID.

Regarding the Administration Panel, we confirm that we are accessing
through the Formations House account.

This is for your kind information and request your further guidance/assistance.

Regards,

Sasikumar
