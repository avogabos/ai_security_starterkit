FOREXTERMINAL Trade Mark certificate
Dear Sarah,
you wrote us "
Also, you can make the payment for our value accounting service
(GBP 300) if you would like us to assist you in processing the Annual Accounts for
the company.
"
Is it too late for sending the Annual Accounts? I don't remember the time and
deadline of reports submission. Write us please what we have to do now
and  if there is the opportunity Formations House to assist us in this
process, we are ready to pay for it.
Also, we haven't received the Trade Mark certificate (FOREXTERMINAL). When did
you send it to us?
And we have one more question. We'd like to open Scottish LP. What the price of
it?  This company will rent the software for natural persons and legal
entities. Do you know, does this activity have to be licensed?
By the way, we can't go to you web site  There are problems
"SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN"
Thank you very much
Maria
