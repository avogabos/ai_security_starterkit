the buy the registered office service in any website the mail forwarding
and scanning is included in that option. Is it included in your website too.

Price Difference
Dear Sarah,
Our company has decided to opt for the Circle Concepts Ltd from
your premium company list along with the registered office and infinioffice
package for 3 months. I saw another company today Â known as Access Logic
LTD incorporated on the same date as cicle concepts. I want to know why the
price of Access logic is higher than Circle Concept. Are they providing any
additional benefit. Also while changing the name of the company can I use Pvt
Ltd instead of limited only. Lastly can I pay by a debit card or I have to use
credit card only.
