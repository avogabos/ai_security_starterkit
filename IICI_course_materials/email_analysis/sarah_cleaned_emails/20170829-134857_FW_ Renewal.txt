Hi

I wish to send a cheque for 
GBP 1350 re above renewal of agreement for services as listed in your
invoice.

Please give me address where to mail cheque.

Are you forwarding incoming mail going to your old address to your new
address for next month or so? I haven't received confirmation from Barclays
that they have amended my address although wrote to them some weeks ago. I'm
concerned their statements may go astray ??

Regards
Paul Wakelin
