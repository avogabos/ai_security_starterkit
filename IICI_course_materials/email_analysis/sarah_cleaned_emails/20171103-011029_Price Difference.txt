Dear Sarah,
                   Our company has decided to opt for the Circle Concepts
Ltd from your premium company list along with the registered office and
infinioffice package for 3 months. I saw another company today  known as
Access Logic LTD incorporated on the same date as cicle concepts. I want to
know why the price of Access logic is higher than Circle Concept. Are they
providing any additional benefit. Also while changing the name of the
company can I use Pvt Ltd instead of limited only. Lastly can I pay by a
debit card or I have to use credit card only.
