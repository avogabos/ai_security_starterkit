Dear Sir,


As we told Sarah, please send us the scan of letters which seem to be very
important. Our client cannot log in to their online banking so please send
us only that kind of notice. We REALLY NEED TO RECEIVE IT  BY TODAY.
We already paid the wallet service.


Please send it to us by TODAY. Our client has been complaining about your
slow response to us. Please make sure to send it by TODAY.

Best Regards,
Asami Yamada
