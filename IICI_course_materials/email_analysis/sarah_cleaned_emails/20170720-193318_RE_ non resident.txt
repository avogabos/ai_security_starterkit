Thank you for the info Sarah, but I'm sure that when your website was still

I still like the idea of a quick and easy solution for my particular
problem, but with this price tag it is to expensive for me.

Regards,

Andre Verhoeven

Hi, i have a question about your ready made Ltd.’s. Is
it possible for a non resident
to buy such a company, and what are the implications when I
do so?
I am interested in a Ltd. with an adress and a business bank
account.
