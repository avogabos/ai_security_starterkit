YES! This is new set to be done at the Taiwan Embassy. The Taiwan Embassy process is a little different to Chinese Embassy I have already emailed him all this info before. Please issue them a new invoice the cost will be the same. 

 

 

Please kindly fill out the form (link below) and have the client sign. The signature must be notarised as genuine by UK/Taiwan notary public or R.O.C. overseas missions.

Once done please kindly scan and email back and I will give you the correct address to send the original too. 

 

1.	A power of attorney or authorisation letter signed by the applicant (please note: the applicant’s signature must be notarised as genuine by a UK or Taiwan Notary Public or an R.O.C. overseas mission). 
2.	Please download the Letter of Authorisation <http://www.roc-taiwan.org/uploads/sites/172/2015/10/Letter-of-Authorisation.pdf>  here.

The TRO does not accept alternative formats.

 

 

For the Chinese Embassy, The authorisation letter is still wrong we are waiting for this letter so that Danielle can go to the PRC embassy and get it legalised. Without it we cannot proceed.
