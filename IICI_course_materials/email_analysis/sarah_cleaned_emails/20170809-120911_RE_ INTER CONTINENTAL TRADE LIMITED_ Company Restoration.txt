Good morning Sarah,

 

I believe they are mistaken on the outstanding fees. They have already been
paid except for perhaps the 1500 GBP for 2016 but that might actually also
be paid but please see attached the payment confirmation for the other fees.

 

I have sent an e-mail to companies house to ask them to correct this.
