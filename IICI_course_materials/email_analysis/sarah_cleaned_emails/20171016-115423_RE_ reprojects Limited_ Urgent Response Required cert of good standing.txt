I am getting concerned in that you guys are never available your web site
lists wrong contact details for you i.e. old address, nobody answers the
phone

 

I made a request for a certificate of good standing, my initial request
payment was not approved and made a new request but to date no confirmation
this is ok, the order number is 194246 18 sept 2017. My bank is pushing for
a new cert. please confirm is I have this or not. My internet is terribly
slow and can not access your site. 

 

Please advise

 

Thanks robin
