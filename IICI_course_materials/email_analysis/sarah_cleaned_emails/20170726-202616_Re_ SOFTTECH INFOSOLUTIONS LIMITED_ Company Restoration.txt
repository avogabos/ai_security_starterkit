Dear Customer,
Thank you for your interest in our services.
We can certainly assist you in registering a UK company.
Following are the details of our services.
-UK Company Formation:
The cost to register a private limited company in the UK is 95
GBP; the time required to complete the procedure is 2-3 working days.
However, if you choose our Express formation service for
additional 25 GBP, your company will be formed within 8 working hours (our
working hours are 0900-1700 GMT).
The basic company requirements are as follows:
• 1 Company Director (can be of any nationality and can reside
anywhere in the world)
• 1 Shareholder (Director can also be a Shareholder)
• Registered address in the UK (i.e. a valid postal address in
England, Wales or Scotland).
The company package includes:
- Company formation fee
- Preparation of Memorandum and Articles
- Hard copy of certificate of incorporation
- Online account to manage your company register (company
documents)
- Online Company Administrator service which allows you to
update the details of the company online (Renewal of this service from next
year will be GBP 25 per annum)
- UK registered office address (Renewal of this service from
next year will be GBP 100 per annum)
- Domain name registration & 1 free email address
*Please note, that this address will only be used for receiving
official mail coming from Companies House; everything else will be returned to
the sender.
You can provide us the company formation details in the attached
file. We also provide other services such as :

; to be submitted to
UK government bodies (Companies House and HMRC) every year. (need to submit for
both trading and non-trading company) : GBP 300 per annum
-Apostille service:

150 GBP and the whole procedure takes 10-14 working days to complete. You will
also be required to pay the courier fee of GBP 65. The following documents will
be Apostilled:
• Certificate of Incorporation
• Articles of Association
• Memorandum of Association
• Form IN01
-Director Privacy Service:
This service enables
Company directors to keep their personal information away from prying eyes and
increase the level of security. Under normal circumstances, the personal
details of company directors (residential address) can be viewed by anyone who
wishes to see the information. For a very modest fee of GBP 150 per annum, we
will provide a “service address” from our central London offices, which will be
the only address visible to the general public.
-Shareholder Protection Service:
This
service is for GBP 150 per annum and enables Company Shareholders to keep their
personal information away from prying eyes and increase the level of security. For
a very modest fee of GBP 150 per annum, we will provide a “service address”
from our central London offices, which will be the only address visible to the
general public.

You will be required to provide following details and
identification documents for the company director/s & shareholder/s
-Brief description of business activity
1. Proof of ID (copy of passport)
