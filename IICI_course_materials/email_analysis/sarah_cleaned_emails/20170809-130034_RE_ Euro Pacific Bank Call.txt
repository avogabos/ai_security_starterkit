Hey, I have been dealing with the bank by email only and they kept asking me to revise the tax form and I emailed them the final draft yesterday. They did not mention anything about calling the customer directly or contacting me. 

 

I hope that they come back to me with good news! As soon as I hear anything from them I will update you.

Dear Sarah,

 

I had a call yesterday from a man saying that he was from Euro Pacific Bank, he asked me several questions relating to the company and also asking where funds where coming from etc. 

 

He mentioned that they will be calling you guys with regards to my application, please can you update me with regards to communication with the bank, as I felt not prepared for the call. Also I would have thought the bank would call from a not with held number.

 

I hope all things being well, that the account is open as soon as possible.

 

Kind regards

 

Ross
