Hi Sarah,

I will obtain proof that the company ITS Projects another company owned by
Gareth made the purchase to you, in the mean time however I emailed clearly
bring to your
attention the constraints facing us:-

We needed a company that had a Vat number trading for 3 years or more for
the same amount, you subsequently came back to me and Gareth who two other
companies for a fee greater
that the parameters I had clearly given you. I then asked if you could do
Mobile Electrics Ltd for the same amount for which after several hours we
have had no reply.

Can you confirm you can this company for the same amount or refund the
money back within 30 minutes.

Regards
