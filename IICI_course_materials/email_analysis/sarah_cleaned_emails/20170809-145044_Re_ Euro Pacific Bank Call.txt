Dear Ross,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that we were requested by the bank official to
revise the tax form and we emailed them the final draft. They did not mention
anything about calling you directly.
I hope that they come back to us with good news! As soon as I hear
anything from them I will update you.

Euro Pacific Bank Call
Dear Sarah,
I had a call yesterday from a man saying that he was from
Euro Pacific Bank, he asked me several questions relating to the company and
also asking where funds where coming from etc.
He mentioned that they will be calling you guys with regards
to my application, please can you update me with regards to communication with
the bank, as I felt not prepared for the call. Also I would have thought the
bank would call from a not with held number.
I hope all things being well, that the account is open as
soon as possible.
Kind regards
Ross
