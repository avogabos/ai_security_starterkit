Dear Sarah,
I found on your web site the possibility to have a Gaming License.
Can you please tell more about this license?
How much would it cost? Which kind of company may have this kind of
license? Annual fees? Which documents are required? What about the tax to
be paid?

Thank you very much for your attention and help.

Best regards,

dott. Aldo Zezza
