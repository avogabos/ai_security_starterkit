Good morning Sarah
I have been given your details as I am looking to purchase
an off the shelf company with the relevant financials with merely to save time.
I have been briefly on your site and see a number of
companies that would be suitable for which I am willing to pay the going rate
for such companies of £4,000.
One of the companies of interest to me is interpath Ltd,
please come back to me asap as I have another of other agents providing me with
suitable companies.
Kind regards
