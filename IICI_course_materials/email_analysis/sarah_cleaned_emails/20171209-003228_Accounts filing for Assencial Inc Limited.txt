Dear Sir/Madam,

We would like you to please file the annual accounts for Assencial Inc
Limited. It is a dormant and non-trading company.
We tried to make the request online but in the company's list, we could not
find 'Assencial Inc Limited'. We only found 'Fish Financial Index Limited'
which is the old name of Assencial Inc.


We look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Asami Yamada
