Dear Support Team,

With regard to the subject Domain, we have the following queries:

1. We would like to manage the domain and email server on our own by
subscribing to cloud or gmail, etc.  How to go about it?
Now, we are accessing the email accounts through Formations House Website.
2. We would like to develop the website using the domain and administer it
solely by us.  How to go about it?

In a nutshell, we would like to manage and control the email accounts and
website by ourselves, and not through Formations House.

Kindly reply.

Regards,

Sasikumar
