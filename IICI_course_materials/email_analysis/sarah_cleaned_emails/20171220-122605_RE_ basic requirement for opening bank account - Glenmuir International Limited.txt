Hi, 

 

Glenmuir International Limited  (BC - Seychelles) 

 

The company provide investment management services on behalf of clients
located in the UK, UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong. The assets that are managed
are real estate property.

 

This involves us taking on the investment via our Asset Management Agreement
and providing access to trust services. 

 

Funds would be received from UAE and the UK and turnover would be circa
£2.3million GBP and the likely transaction size would be from £2,000 to
£300,000. 

 

Mr. Richard Chamberlain is the UBO and director. 

 

Please let me know if they would be ok to open an account?

 

Many thanks!

Hi Nadya

 

Please have this information ready to send them in order to evaluate if they
can process or not

 

 

Hi,

 

All banks have their own list of high risk/ sanctioned countries. These are
countries where if the clients business or remittances are involved, the
bank will not even consider their bank application. 

Hence, we will need to understand the following before recommending.

 

             which countries will be involved in incoming/outgoing
remittances,

             business nature

             country where company is incorporated

             countries businesses will be conducted

             nationality of UBOs (Ultimate Beneficiary Owners)

             and any other questions posed by the bank. 

 

 

As for required personal/ business documents, generally these are required.

             Certificate of Incorporation

             Certificate of Incumbency  

             Memorandum & Articles of Association 

             Register of Directors

             Register of Members

             Organogram of the company (if any)

             Passport copy

             Proof of residential address less than 3 months (Do not accept
TV/Mobile phone bill. Driving license/ Utility bill/ Bank statement/ Bank
reference letter. Full physical address must be seen.)

             CV

             Business Plan

             Bank reference letter 

 

Do note that all banks may ask for additional information/ documents. Some
banks do not require bank reference letter or may request for 2 bank
reference letters.

Granting of bank account opening is also subject to banks discretion.
