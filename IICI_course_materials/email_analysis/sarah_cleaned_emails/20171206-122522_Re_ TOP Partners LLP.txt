Dear
              Mr Tinák,
It
              was a pleasure to meet with Mr’s Bojkovsky this morning
              and discuss all the requirements.
Process
Appoint
                Mr Adam Bojkovsky to UK Readymade Company – 1 working
                day
Incorporate
                2 BVI companies (Company Reg no. issued in 3 working
                days)
Appoint
                LTD & 2 BVI as partners in LLP – 3 working days
Process
                bank Account Opening for BVI’s – typically 10 working
                days
Provide
                Documents needed to client for LLP and LTD bank account.
                – next day from process 3
Mr Adam Bojkovsky selected EUROPEAN SOLVE LTD formed
                  in 2014. However, this company has already been sold.
                  We will provide  ADVANCED CENTRE LTD or any other
                  company formed in 2014. Please confirm.
For
              the  process 1 -3 we shall require the ID documents for 3
              persons.
For
              process 4 it is likely we shall require the notarised ID
              for 2 persons (Mr Bojkovsky & Mr Tinák)
ID
              should be clear colour scan of passport and proof of
              address such as bank statement dated within 3 months.
We
              shall check the availability of names in BVI for Green
              Servis Consulting Ltd and Lutin Corp Ltd (and offer
              similar alternatives if not available)
For
              the UK company, we do not think it necessary to appoint a
              UK based director at this time as I believe with the
              correct ID Mr Bojkovsky (jr) should be able to open an
              account at Barclays if not the ANZ branch  in UK for the
              business.
Please
              let us know when you will make a payment, and we shall
              prepare the partnership Agreement for the LLP when we
              appoint the new partners, confirming which are the
              nominated (UK LTD and Mr Tinák BVI) and the designated
              partner as (Mr Bojkovsky (Sr) BVI).
If
              in the future you wish to draft and file a custom
              partnership agreement we will be happy to assist you.
To
              confirm if you require any further information relating to
              the technical delivery of this solution please feel free
              to email Charlotte directly at
charlotte@formationshouse.com
or msg at 44 7788883680. All other enquires, please email
