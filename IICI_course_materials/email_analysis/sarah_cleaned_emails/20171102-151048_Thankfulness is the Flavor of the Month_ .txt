Thankfulness is the Flavor of the Month!
We 
                      must find time to stop and thank the people who make a difference 
                      in our lives.
~John F. Kennedy
The flavor of the month of November is thankfulness. 
                      With
Thanksgiving
coming up this month is special.
Autumn
is at its peak giving way to winter. The air has already 
                      started to feel cooler and it is really windy here in the 
                      Big Apple.
I was going through the emails and was delighted 
                      to receive some generous comments and appreciation for my 
                      blogs and
weekly 
                      newsletters
. I want to take a moment to thank all my 
                      readers for being with me in this journey of lifes exploration 
                      through stories which move us, provoke us and makes us wear 
                      our thinking hats. I am glad to bring you a daily dose of 
                      joy no matter what you are going through, my win is your 
                      smile.
I was thrilled to read some remarkable 
                      comments on our

                      Let go and let God as my North star point of reference, 
                      has been a marvellous unravelling of myself and a magnanimous 
                      understanding of me within the bigger picture. There are 
                      so many wonderful references youve made in this piece,

                      all which lead me to think that we are of like mind surely, 
                      but more interesting to me is the evolution of you up to 
                      this point. A great writer indeed, you have me wanting to 
                      know more.Yours is a timely reminder today and I appreciate
