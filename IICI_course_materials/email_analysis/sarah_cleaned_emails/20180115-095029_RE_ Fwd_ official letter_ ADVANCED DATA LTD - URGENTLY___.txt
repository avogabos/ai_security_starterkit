Dear Lubos,

 

We have looked into this and confirm the CT600 which this relates to was filed, so we are talking to HMRC to resolve this. When we sold the company we ran a credit report and the company had nothing negative, this will be removed soon.

Once we know the exact date we will inform you.

But note there is no debt against the company

Thanks

Charlotte Pawar
