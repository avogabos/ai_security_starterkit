Dear Sarah,
I checked too by CompaniesHouse:

*Status*: Dissolved 01/08/2017
*Date of Incorporation*: 25/09/2013

I suppose we have time to solve the issue before end of July.
Please let me know the cost to renew FH's services and fill the HRMC forms
(sent on 2 July 2017 from your support).
I will contact straight away the real owner (who doesnt speak english at
all) and let
you know his decision.
please let me know your direct phonenumber.
best regards.
alberto

Hello Sarah,
I just chatted with Athena
and she suggested me to email you
sarah@formationshouse.com
or to contact you on +
44 203 823 6006
I
called this number on 18 July and somebody told me to call a couple of days
later.
I
wrote an email to Felix Almeida (he seems no more working in FH) and I received
the attached answer  from Mr. Elliot B. (I tried to call him today but
nobody connect me to him ).
I
called the phone number to talk you , but you were not available.
I
received  a few weeks ago an email from FH regarding services expiring
soon, but how can I do it if the website is down ? I received another email
from support with attached letters from HMRC.
By
the way I forgot my ID number to login in FH "My account".
Sarah,
how can we solve  everything ? Do you have a direct phonenumber otherwise
by writing it is a waste of time.
I
suppose  you have my name in a file: Alberto Ferrari
Sorry
for my english.
ciao
from Italy
