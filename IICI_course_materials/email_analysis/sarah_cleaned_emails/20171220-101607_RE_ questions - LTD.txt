Apologies Lubos, I did not see this email ..

My Answers:

 

1.	The monthly salaries are below the PAYE (Pay As You Earn HMRC tax registration for employees – which is roughly £950 per month per employee), so you only need to ensure you issue payslips each month for when you pay the employees.
2.	Sorry im am unclear what you mean, the employees can be paid from an account anywhere but should be from an account in the company name. for the LLP you can state that is why you want to open an account and the bank will ask what the employees job will be .
3.	This company may be able to assist, however it is likely the account will be an accounts within a trading facility and not with a tier 1 bank like HSBC. However if you first make an application to either Barclays, RBS or HSBC with at least two proofs of address for the director and attend an appointment in branch, I think it will not be a problem.
4.	Please explain this question again, if you mean can we provide a bank account in the UK, we cannot provide it, only give you guidance and support to do so in the UK.
5.	Yes you must register VAT once you receive more than £88,000 GBP in reveneue, and yes we can assist in the registration and once registered we will assist in the accounting each 3 months for VAT as required.

 

Please let me know any other questions or help we can provide

 

Thanks
