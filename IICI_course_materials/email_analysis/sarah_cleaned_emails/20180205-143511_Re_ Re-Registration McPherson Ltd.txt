Dear Sarah,

I’m unable to access my A/C on line, I think because the registered email address is not current. 
Would you please be so kind as to inform me what I should do to gain access to my account with you. I would like to change the registration email address to this one: bduderwebb@gmail.com.
The situation is quite urgent as I’m trying to arrange a bank A/C for McPherson Ltd and I need to print out various registration documents.

Pls call me on +30 6951951222 if you need to discuss this with me.
Thanking you for your kind attention hereto.
Awaiting your reply.

Sincerely

Bernard Webb
