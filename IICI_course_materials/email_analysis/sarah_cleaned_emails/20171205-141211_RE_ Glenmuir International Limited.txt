The fees are 500, and we would require the company documents apostilled and notarised id for the UBos; and a full breakdown of the business, trading countries and transaction sizes.

 

Initially it may be easier to let us know which countries funds come in and out from and what the purpose of the transactions are and we will check with the bank any preliminary issues before taking a fee for our service.

 

thanks

Sarah.

 

I see on your new website that you offer a bank account opening service for ABC Bank in Mauritius. Would you be able to assist in a bank account application for my company Glenmuir International Limited?

 

If yes can you please confirm the costs and what is required for me to open an account.

 

Kind Regards,

Richard Chamberlain
