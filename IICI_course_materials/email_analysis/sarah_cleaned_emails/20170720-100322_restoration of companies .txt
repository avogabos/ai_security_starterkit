Dear Sarah,
I trust my e-mail finds you well.  Please kindly note that we have restored 2 companies of ours which were previously liquidated.
We have requested the new authentication codes to be sent to the company's reg. office and I would highly appreciate if these were sent to you, to forward them to us.
The 2 companies are:

*         BLUE HORIZON NAVIGATION LIMITED

*         FAITH MARINE LIMITED

Thanking you in advance and looking forward receiving your feedback.
Kindest Regards,

Maria Mita Nicolaou
