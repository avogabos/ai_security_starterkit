Good afternoon Dear Support,

 

but I sent to you and Mrs. Sarah these documents from Monday maybe five times as the attachment of the e-mails.

 

Do you have these documents?? I´m sending documents once again now. 

 

I don´t know, where can be a problem.

 

But we are really hurry for the establishment of the company, because it is long time form paying of the establishment.

From 15th of November 2017, they aren´t no changes with establishment.

 

Really thank you for your answer

 

Best regards
