 Dear Sir / Madam,

 Thank you for your email.

  

 Company Number:

 08706470

 Company Name:

 LONDON CITY TRAVEL LTD

 The above company was dissolved for failure to file statutory documents.

 When thinking of restoring a company it is always best to ask the following
 questions:-

 Why does the company need to be restored-

 To release assets

 To pursue litigation

 To trade

 If the company is required to be restored to release assets, you can ask the question
 ”Is the sole reason to restore the company to release money from a company bank
 account and if so were the assets under £3000 at the time of dissolution”.

 IF YES - There may be no need to restore the company, you may consider
 contacting the Treasury Solicitors office for further advice on how to access
 the money, either by the following web address  www.gov.uk/bonavacantia or via
 the following telephone number: 0207 210 4700.

 IF NO - If the assets are over £3000 the company must be restored to the
 register to release assets.  The company must be restored by an order of
 court - guidance notes on restoration procedures can be found on the Treasury
 Solicitors web site -  TheTreasurySolicitor@governmentlegal.gov.uk

 The cost for a company to be restored by an order of court is between £1,200 to
 £2,500.  The breakdown of the costs are Court fees ranging from £150 
 and the Registrar's fees of £300.  The rest is made up of solicitors fees
 and the restoration process can take about 6-8 weeks.

 IF THE COMPANY HAS NO ASSETS - It may be more cost effective and less time
 consuming to incorporate a new company.

 IF THE COMPANY IS TO BE RESTORED TO PURSUE LITIGATION ACTION - The same
 procedures apply and an application can be made by a creditor, Liquidator or
 any interested party 

 IF THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO BE RESTORED TO TRADE - If the company was
 dissolved by voluntary dissolution, the company can only be restored by an
 order of court, the application must be made by a member or director of the
 company and guidance can be obtained from the Treasury Solicitors, website -
 TheTreasurySolicitor@governmentlegal.gov.uk

 If the company was dissolved by default procedures, the company can either by
 restored to the register by an order of court or by an application for administrative
 restoration.

 An application for administrative restoration must be made by a former member
 of director of the company - the forms required for an application are:

 RT01 FORM together with an administrative fee of £100 (this form also includes the
 statement of compliance) 

 ALL OUTSTANDING DOCUMENTS (including relevant filing fees)

 ALL OUTSTANDING LATE FILING PENALTIES - This information can be obtained from
 the Restoration Department in writing (or by email to
 enquiries@companies-house.gov.uk)

 A BONA VACANTIA WAIVER LETTER - This can be obtained from the Bona Vacantia
 Division of the Treasury Solicitors Department by accessing the website -
 www.gov.uk/bonavacantia.  The fee for this document is £64 and the onus is
 on the former member/director to provide this document.

 On receipt of the application, if all documents and fees are acceptable
 restoration of the company will take approximately 10 days.

 If any documents or fees are not included in the application, the application
 will be rejected and all documents, late filing penalties and filing fees will
 be returned.

 Please note that the filing fee of £100 for the RT01 form will be retained as
 this payment is due on receipt of an application for administrative restoration
 not registration.  However we will not charge an additional filing fee
 when the application containing the appropriate documents, penalties and
 payments are re-submitted.

 ANY FURTHER GUIDANCE REQUIRED CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE TREASURY SOLICITORS
 WEBSITE ON COURT ORDER RESTORATION PROCEDURES OR CH WEBSITE FOR ADMIN
 RESTORATION.

 If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact
 us.
