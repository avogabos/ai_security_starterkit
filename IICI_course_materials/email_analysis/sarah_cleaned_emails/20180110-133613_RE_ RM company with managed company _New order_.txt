As we always advise, we cannot provide a managed company service with their director also present.

We would not really be able to assist with providing a director for this type of business activity, and it might be difficult for us to obtain a bank account for US transactions however there are many banking service providers (not banks) who support the cryptocurrency market and wont require the director to be UK based.

I don’t understand the last enquiry of name of the company that’s buys

 

They can buy the companies as RM and we can offer a small discount but im unsure we can assist with providing a director

Good morning Sarah,

regarding the request of my client, and his needs, I communicate the following:

- my client intends to buy an LTD or LLC in the UK. I have identified n. 2 companies available at Formation House: International Commercial Ltd; Tax Center Ltd.

- Customer activity: brokerage and sale of crypto currencies

- All payments arrive from the USA and return to the USA

- Our client requires total management of the company with the inclusion of only one director of his own competence and another director of your competence. They require certificates of ownership of the bearer company.

- The customer requests a bank account in the name of the company that buys and possibly the opening of a new bank account. 

I look forward to knowing if the companies indicated are still available; which one is the most suitable for my client; what is the total cost of the operation; what is the annual management cost of the company.

Thanks.

Regarde
