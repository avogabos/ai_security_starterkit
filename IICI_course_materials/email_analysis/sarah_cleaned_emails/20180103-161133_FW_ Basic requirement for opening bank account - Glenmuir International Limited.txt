Hi Oliver,

 

A Happy New Year to you !

 

Ive look through the information you provided. Its not sufficient for
banks full assessment as some information is missing. For instance, goals
and objectives, origins of initial deposit, revenue will be generated from
which countries, expected annual expenditure, UBOs CV/background, etc.
Attached Business Plan for clients completion. 

Also required are Registers to show proof of director/UBO. 

 

Also, do note that after initial assessment, an notarised recent proof of
address, recent Certificate of Incumbency is required. 

 

All other requests/clarifications will be upon banks full assessment. 

 

 

With Regards,

 

Wai Meng Choo

Hi Oliver,

 

A Merry Christmas to you. 

You mentioned investment management services. Does this company have a
