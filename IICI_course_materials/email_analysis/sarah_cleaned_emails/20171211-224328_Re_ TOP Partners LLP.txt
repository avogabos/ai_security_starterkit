Please
                    find attached an updated invoice with the chosen
                    company.
We
                  sell our shelf companies
                  quickly hence why the last 2 became unavailable.
Please
                  let me know when
                  payment is sent, and I shall reserve the names now

Re: TOP Partners LLP
Dear Charlotte,
I'm happy that your meeting was successful and the
                client was satisfied.
About change company => I suggest company with name
                =>  ADVANCED
                CENTER LTD  If it is not possible second company can be 
                ELITE TRAVEL
                LTD
I know not if price of invoice will be also change when
                we want ELITE TRAVEL
                LTD. This company is more good because the client is
                golfer and he wants
                organize a golf tournaments for our business partners.
Tomorrow I will do pay the invoce. Also we prepare shall
                documents and passport
                (ID card) with the notarised.
Best regards.

Dear
                    Mr Tinák,
It
                    was a pleasure to meet with Mr’s Bojkovsky this
                    morning and discuss all the requirements.
Process
1.
Appoint
                    Mr Adam
                    Bojkovsky to UK Readymade Company – 1 working day
2.
Incorporate
                    2 BVI
                    companies (Company Reg no. issued in 3 working days)
3.
Appoint
                    LTD & 2
                    BVI as partners in LLP – 3 working days
4.
Process
                    bank
                    Account Opening for BVI’s – typically 10 working
                    days
5.
Provide
                    Documents
                    needed to client for LLP and LTD bank account. –
                    next day from process 3
Mr Adam Bojkovsky selected EUROPEAN SOLVE LTD
                        formed in 2014. However,
                        this company has already been sold. We will
                        provide  ADVANCED CENTRE LTD
                        or any other company formed in 2014. Please
                        confirm.
For
                    the  process 1 -3 we shall require the ID documents
                    for 3 persons.
For
                    process 4 it is likely we shall require the
                    notarised ID for 2 persons (Mr
                    Bojkovsky & Mr Tinák)
ID
                    should be clear colour scan of passport and proof of
                    address such as bank
                    statement dated within 3 months.
We
                    shall check the availability of names in BVI for
                    Green Servis Consulting Ltd
                    and Lutin Corp Ltd (and offer similar alternatives
                    if not available)
For
                    the UK company, we do not think it necessary to
                    appoint a UK based director at
                    this time as I believe with the correct ID Mr
                    Bojkovsky (jr) should be able to
                    open an account at Barclays if not the ANZ branch 
                    in UK for the business.
Please
                    let us know when you will make a payment, and we
                    shall prepare the partnership
                    Agreement for the LLP when we appoint the new
                    partners, confirming which are
                    the nominated (UK LTD and Mr Tinák BVI) and the
                    designated partner as (Mr
                    Bojkovsky (Sr) BVI).
If
                    in the future you wish to draft and file a custom
                    partnership agreement we will
                    be happy to assist you.
To
                    confirm if you require any further information
                    relating to the technical
                    delivery of this solution please feel free to email
