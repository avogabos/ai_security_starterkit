Director and can be contacted by email at: ross@wcgci.com or telephone

World Class Group Consultants INC (WCGCI)
Hi
Can you please advise what you know about this Campany who
are using your name and address as contact details for their business
UK Head Office:
101 Finsbury Pavement, Moorgate, London, EC2A 1RS
International Headquaters:
World Class Group Consultants INC (WCGCI) company no. 134519 Mayfair
Trust Group Limited, Second floor, Capital City, Independence Avenue, P.O. Box

I can find no trace of the company in its own right and
there is little uK tracability
If the Company is known to you do you have any details of
its senior managment so I can contact them to validate their authenticity as
part of some due dilligence I am doing as a client who wishes to invest in them
