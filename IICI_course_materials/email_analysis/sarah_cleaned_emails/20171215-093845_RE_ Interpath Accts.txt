Hi Gareth,

 

Im actually just checking with Companies House as ive looked at our tech
system this (the filing queue) and see what we sent to be filed, is not what
is showing. CH ae checking and we have told them we are resubmitted this
morning, to ensure they add the correct file. both their end and our end
think the file that was posted on the system at CH is the previous micro
accounts and not the latest in the filing queue.

 

Give us 45 mins to confirm when the right ones are posted on their system..
then I will call and check that CH can post them on the public system asap,
and ensure it's the right file. 

 

Re Peters email, given that an order was placed for a company, payment
received, then we were told to refund immediately and then asked to offer a
higher priced product at the same rate, and pushed for further discount, we
have been very reasonable. Once the sale was agreed, we proceeded as we
would with any RM sale and started to move the mandate. My team have
received many many calls to try force us to accommodate your timing, which
is not in our terms and conditions but never the less we have accommodated
them. We are then asked to appoint a number of directors, back date
appointments etc again we are not obliged to do. You then insist on filing
accounts for a company we owned during the period you wish to file for,
again not under our terms and conditions and we have never had any
obligation to support this. However we did agree based upon our goal to
provide good customer service. For this reason I do ask that you do not keep
calling Nadya, she was the nominated director for the company before but is
not your account manager, not an accountant, not a manager nor any other
position that she should receive so many calls. 

 

I shall chase up and push for the accounts to be reflected at CH asap and
let you know when they are. 

 

If you have any further issues after this point I shall suggest you arrange
to meet us at our offices in Harley Place next week, when I should be
available. 

 

Thanks

Charlotte Pawar

Dear Gareth and partners,

 

I've looked at the history of the discussions and can see there are a lot of
changes and requests within a short time.

 

Our accounts team finish by 3pm each day as typically all filings are done
by 2pm on the day required. The accounts we filed had been approved by
yourselves and I understand that perhaps they weren't checked. I understand
this is sometimes the case.

 

The accounts you wanted to file are quite different to the ones from the
period before in terms of the headers and columns, micro entity accounts
merge these and as a result sometimes the totals do not quite reflect the
assets or shareholder funds. I understand however you would like all headers
to be unmerged and less abbreviated.

I can see from the accounts you prepared, there is a tax liability.

In the morning I will speak with our head of accounting again and check
before filing they will match in terms of assets and revenues what you wish
to show, and we will ask once more for an approval in our filing format, and
then file.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
