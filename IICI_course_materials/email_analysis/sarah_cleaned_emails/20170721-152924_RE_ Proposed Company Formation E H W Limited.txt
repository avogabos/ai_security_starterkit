Dear Paul,

With reference to the query received from you, please note that currently
our website and servers are down for maintenance. The server will be up
shortly; we are sorry for the inconvenience.

 

However, we can take company formation orders directly and submit it to
Companies House accordingly. You can provide us the Incorporation Details in
the attached form and the service you would like to order and I will process
it accordingly.

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information
or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.
