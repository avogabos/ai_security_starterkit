Thank you foe your email.
Well I'm in vacation untill monday evening.
However, please note that media plus registeration on my name

bought it.

Companies House is March 2015 - March 2016. Unfortunitly it is the
responcebility of the old owner of Media Plus. Thus we are eager ti fill thr
Dormat form of March 2016- March 2017.
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any request.
