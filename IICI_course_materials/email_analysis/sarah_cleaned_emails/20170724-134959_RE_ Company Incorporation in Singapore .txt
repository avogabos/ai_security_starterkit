Hi, Sarah,

A company is ment to be only a SPV special purpose vehicle to invest  some funds (100k€) and buy another Singapore company – a start-up which is valued at almost nothing - 1SGD and capitalise it to 100k€.

There will be no trading, SPV should get profits at the end of business year – there is a possibility that we will merge SPV with the start up.

6500gbp is a lot for that purpose. J

Hope you can come up with some better solution

Best, Matjaz
