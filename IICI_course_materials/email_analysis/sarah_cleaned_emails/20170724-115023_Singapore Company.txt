Dear 

 

Thank you for your enquiry about forming a Singapore company.

We are able to provide a complete Singapore company service in line with the
local registry requirements and to provide you with the service you have
requested.

The total fee will be £6500 GBP including the required resident Director and
Secretary, and the opening of a Bank Account. 

 

Processing time will vary but the company process itself is approximately 4
working days, and for the account there will be a number of business
information items requested.

If the business is considered a higher risk or has a high turnover
additional fees may apply.

 

There may be other suitable alternatives we can offer if we are able to know
I little more about your business.

 

Please can you let us have a little more information on the nature of the
business, where it trades and anticipated level of turnover

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
