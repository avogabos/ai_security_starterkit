Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that the cost of Seychelles Company License renewal
and registered address and registered agent fee has increased from April 2017
and the new renewal cost is now GBP 500 per annum.
We rarely increase our prices but with global costs increasing
we have no choice as the company renewal not just includes Govt License fee but
also offshore registered agents fee, registered address and company
administration fee.
The renewal amount has been updated in our customer's account. I
have placed the below renewal order:
Ishtar Advisory Limited
Renewal order 193850
Amount: GBP 500
You can update the payment of the order online by implementing
the following steps:
-Go to
www.formationshouse.com
-Click on the option "MY ACCOUNT"
-Provide your login details
-Click on the option “Update Payment” that is on the top.
-Click on the option “Update Payment”.
Clicking on this will take you to the page from where update the
payment.
I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further
information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
Best Regards,
Sarah
