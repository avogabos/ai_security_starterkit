Dear Sirs/Madam,

Thank you for clarifying our queries.

We will follow your guidance.

As suggested, kindly re-generate an activation email and send to Email
ID ahmed_awan@hotmail.com to activate the domain and email accounts.

We have noted your answer on the size of the attachment.  Also, kindly
inform us the size (capacity) of each email account.

As regards the Administration Panel, kindly be informed that we are
using Google Chrome to access the email accounts.

Awaiting your reply.

Regards,

Sasikumar
