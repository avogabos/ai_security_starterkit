Dear Sarah,

 

We will arrange the payment by tomorrow.

 

The client also wishes to pay a retainer fee for the managed company service and wish if you could arrange the name change of the company and bank account ASAP by end of this month? 

 

The client wishes to apply for the bank line service as well for himself and please advise the requirements? Kindly confirm the bank line service will allow the client to make payments overseas by himself?

 

Please also provide a revised invoice with the USD bank account for my colleague’s immediate handling.

 

 

 

Thank you very much!

 

Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact us.

 

 

Best Regards,

Scottie Liu
