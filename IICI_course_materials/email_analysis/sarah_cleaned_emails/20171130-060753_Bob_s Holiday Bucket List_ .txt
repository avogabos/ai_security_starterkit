Bobs Holiday Bucket List!
What keeps you going year on year? Life is same and predictable like the hanging wall tapestry is woven with threads of the same colors with measured twists and turns, blended into a uniform pattern. Whats new here? What do we look forward to?
I often feel a gloom come over me until I weave into my lifes artwork a new colorful thread of my wishes and dreams, which gives it a newness and me a reason to go on.
This holiday season I am making a bucket list for me and my folks, join me!
