Re: READYMADE UK COMPANY: DELIVER LTD ::reminder::
Dear
Sarah
Thanks
for your email
As
I stated in my previous email your asking price is way to expensive for me.
I
am a sole trader just starting a business .
The
fact it is a 12 year old company is of no value to me .
I
just like the name that s all. I have registered deliver app ltd but I do like
deliver ltd and am keen to negotiate but you are asking wsg more than I can
afford.
I
will increase my offer to 750 pounds for the company .
