Good morning Sarah,
regarding the request of my client, and his needs, I communicate the
following:
- my client intends to buy an LTD or LLC in the UK. I have identified n. 2
companies available at Formation House: International Commercial Ltd; Tax
Center Ltd.
- Customer activity: brokerage and sale of crypto currencies
- All payments arrive from the USA and return to the USA
- Our client requires total management of the company with the inclusion of
only one director of his own competence and another director of your
competence. They require certificates of ownership of the bearer company.
- The customer requests a bank account in the name of the company that buys
and possibly the opening of a new bank account.
I look forward to knowing if the companies indicated are still available;
which one is the most suitable for my client; what is the total cost of the
operation; what is the annual management cost of the company.
Thanks.
Regarde
