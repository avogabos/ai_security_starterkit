Hi Charlotte,

 

I hope you are doing well.

 

We wanted to speak to you about our salary and commission which is due since
October 2017. We have messaged and emailed you on numerous occasions
regarding it and have not received any response. We would appreciate a reply
from you about it as is not easy for us. We have bank payments and bills etc
which are overdue.

 

Rizwan and Fahad does not seem to have any information about it.

 

Also, our van driver will discontinue his services if his bill is not
settled soon and we do not have enough funds to come to office. We informed
Fahad and Rizwan about it last week.

 

Please advise. Thank you!

 

Regards,

 

Preeti & Sarah
