Taking 
                      Good Care Of Yourself!
We owe it to ourselves. Dont we?
I was walking down the road and like always my eyes were traveling from one thing to other skimming through the colors, the textures, the adventures and the misadventures. I stopped at the sight of a cobbler who sits there every day at this time. I couldnt help noticing how tattered his own shoes were, I wondered why would he ignore himself while he works so diligently on shining and mending others shoes. I shrugged with disbelief and carried on.
As I entered the office, 
                      I noticed the lady who sits at the reception. She had dabbed 
                      her face with cosmetics but her eyes were weary and her

were cold and often unreturned.
This made me think. Shouldnt those people who are meant to make others lives easy and joyful, be cheerful, hale and hearty themselves?
