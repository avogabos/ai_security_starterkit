When doing the transfer at RBS the forms to appoint a new director will be filled and taken to the branch with the new director and their ID docuemnts,

While the director is here we will ask them to sign undated Change of Name form for the bank and also a signatory removal form in the name of the existing director.

Once the new director is added to the account successfully, then we can file at the bank the 2 forms, and the name will be changed and the existing director removed and no questions should be raised.

 

Changing the name and then filing to change ownership will result in an account review which is lengthy, so this way there is not trigger for an account review

Dear Sarah, 

 

If the client did as you say to change the company name after the transfer of the bank account, what would be the procedures? Will client have to go to the bank again for the account name change process and can it be done on the next day if the company name was changed right after the transfer?

 

I think would it be easier for the client to arrange the bank account transfer and change of account name at once. The bank will review the new owner and his business anyway... Or do you provide nominee service that could easier transfer the bank account successfully?

 

As you said that the bank will review the new business before transfer of the bank account and SIC code. Are you indicating that with high possibility the new business might not be accepted by the bank and close the bank account? Please advise the rate of the possibility of success to transfer the bank account according to your previous cases?

 

The client is not fluent in speaking English, can you please assist the client to find a Mandarine translator to accompany the client to attend the bank meeting? Please obtain the fee quote for the client. 

 

Thank you.

 

 

Best regards,

Scottie Liu
