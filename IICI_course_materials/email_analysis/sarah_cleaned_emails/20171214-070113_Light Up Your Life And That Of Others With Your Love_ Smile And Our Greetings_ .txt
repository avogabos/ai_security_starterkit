Light Up Your Life And That Of Others With Your Love, Smile And Our Greetings!
The festive time is upon us. Send
Advent
regards,
Hanukkah
prayers,
Season's 
                      Greetings
or
Christmas
wishes, it is indeed time to reach out to your loved ones.
The
autumn
temperatures descended with the rains that brought 
                      along with it some chilly winds. We are preparing for the
winter
and
Holiday 
                      Season
, the warm clothes are out of the attic 
                      for puffing life back into them. Aaliyah has an interesting 
                      way to get rid of the odor from the winter gear, she uses 
                      up my vodka and mixes one part of it with two parts of water 
                      and sprays it on the woolens and lets it sit for a while 
                      and it kills the musty smell.
She loves to stock the refrigerator and 
                      freezers with exotic vegetables, meat and sauces for her 
                      festive cooking and our backyard get-together. I like to 
                      restock my wine and beer to welcome my buddies to the many 
                      relaxing evenings that we spend during this time reflecting 
                      on the past year and planning for the
New 
                      Year
.
