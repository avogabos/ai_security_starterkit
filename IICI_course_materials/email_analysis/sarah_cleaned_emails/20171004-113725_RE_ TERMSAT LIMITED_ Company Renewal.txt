Hi Charlotte, they only received USD 135; pls make the remaining payment of USD 20.

Some offshore renewals are due; waiting for invoices from Mayfair. Will forward it to you as soon as I will receive it.

 

Thanks!

Dear Sarah

 

Thank you for your email.

 

The USD130 was received in full – thank you.

 

We note that you sent the 2nd payment USD155. We only received USD135 in our bank account (short of USD20). Kindly make payment of the USD20, in order that we can proceed with the renewal.

 

Kind regards
