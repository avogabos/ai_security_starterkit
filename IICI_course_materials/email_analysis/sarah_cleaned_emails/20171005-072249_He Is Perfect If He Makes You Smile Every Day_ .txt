He Is Perfect If He Makes You Smile Every Day!
The humdrum about perfect relationships, 
                      prince charming and the ideal woman sometimes makes me question 
                      the basis on which real relationships are formed. I believe 
                      with my own fallouts and relationship experiences in this 
                      fast-moving city of New York where time waits for none, 
                      that in the hope of perfection we miss out on many right 
                      ones.
For a long time I did not understand 
                      what is it that will make me stay in a relationship until 
                      I met Bob. No matter, Bob and I have our lows and highs. 
                      At times I yell when he makes me mad, at other times, he 
                      forgets about me and becomes insensitive around his buddies. 
                      We overanalyze each other and become too judgmental. We 
                      also try to fix each other more than accepting each other 
                      at times. It is so simple to step into the role of a parent 
                      instead of a
friend
without understanding that we dont need to change the other 
                      one. We need to just make sure we are like buddies and allow 
                      the space for self-growth.
What is important for both 
                      of us is to have moments when we laugh together, hug, smile 
                      at each other, love hard and share our challenges and milestones 
                      with each other every single day. I accept that I wont 
                      be on his mind all day, he understands my millionth mood 
                      swing. We take care of not hurting each other and thats 
                      the only promise between us. The moments of closeness are 
                      enough to make our not so perfect relationship perfect enough 
                      to create a lifetime of memories.
I
love
you Bob.
