Hi Sarah

Thank you for the email.

I am into furniture business and these company names doesn't go with my
business. I am sure you can help me with the name change if I go ahead and
buy one of the companies but this price is way out of my budget.

Kindly provide me a good price so that I can finalize it asap.

Thanks
Alex
