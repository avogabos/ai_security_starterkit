                      Resolves For 2018!
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering, It will be happier.
~ Alfred Lord Tennyson
It is human behavior  to dream and set higher benchmarks for themselves, not backing the same with a concrete and reasonable plan. Get out of the what  until you have established your why.
Often we get so lost in the list of fancy stuffs we want to do that we ignore the most important ones and overlook the creation of new possibilities.
Megan, a photographer and blogger friend of mine, loves to travel and past year she travelled almost every month but that led to disharmony in her family life. She felt distant from her daughters and  that ultimately upset her so much that it overshadowed all the joy she experienced in her expeditions. We sat at the club reviewing our year and she shared that even though she followed her passion and achieved most of the goals she had set for 2017 she felt somewhere she lost her precious time as a mother. She stated that when she sat down to understand why this happened she realized she had become obsessed with her bucket list of wishes and dreams rather than balancing it with her present gratefulness list. This year she promised to pack in a few of her photography expeditions with her children.
The ultimate goal of resolves is to break out from anything that limits you in experiencing happiness to the fullest. We must be aligned with our why and not just our what and then the how will fall in place.
Be a realist when you are setting your resolves for 2018. Make sure you have enough space for your loved ones in your intentions.
Remember the social needs and love needs are what makes us human. So enjoy and reach out.
Have a splendid
