Sarah,

The payment for the renewal on both the Carlton James BVI companies has been paid and we need to provide a new share certificate as per the recent allocation made. However the online system is suspended and I cannot download the new certificate for Mr Keen. Can you please send one via email to me.

Kind Regards,
Richard Chamberlain
