Dear Lewis,



Please accept my apologies! I was a little confused, regarding Republic of China and Peoples Republic of China.



It is the Taiwan Embassy that you require legalisation from?



The cost is the same however the process is a little different.



Please kindly fill out the form (link below) and have the client sign. The signature must be notarised as genuine by UK/Taiwan notary public or R.O.C. overseas missions.
