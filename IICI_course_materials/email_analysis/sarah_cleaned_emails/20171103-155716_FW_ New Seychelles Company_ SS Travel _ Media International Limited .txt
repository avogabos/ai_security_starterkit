Well before we took the new order we should have done a check on how he
mamages the other companies he has with us, I see a trail of dissolved
companies before they file accounts, 

 

So we need to explain to the customer this;

Dear ..

 

Following the additional compliance steps required for a Seychelles company
we have raised some concerns and need to clarify.

Please enxplain why many of your directorships are to companies that became
dissolved without filing accounts. One of your companies is due to file by
19th November, do you intend to file account for this company? As we will
need to understand why so many are named similarly and allowed to become
dissolved. 

 

Some additional searches have linked your name, age and location to some
news stories in 2011 to 2013 involved illegal betting. Please clarify this
information.

 

We await your reply

Many thanks.

 

 

 

 

Then send to Seychelles:

 

The name is very common so its difficult to be 100% sure however the
customer has incorporated other companies with us and a director of active
trading ravel related companies that trade in the UK such as

https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.travelunravel.com

we will check further and come back to you if we feel there is some
compliance issues, but meantwhile please consider this information
