Dear Lubos,

 

Thankyou for sending the proof. I have checked and the funds are not in our account yet however it can take 2 business days, so I shall check again later. Meanwhile we prepare the order and information for the BVI incorporations too so everything moves swiftly.

 

I note the email with the new order and Sarah will raise an invoice for you today

 

Kind Regards,

Charlotte Pawar
