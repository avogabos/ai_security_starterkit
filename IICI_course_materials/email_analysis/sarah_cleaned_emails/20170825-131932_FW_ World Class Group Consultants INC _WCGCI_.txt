Hi

 

Can you please advise what you know about this Campany who are using your name and address as contact details for their business

 

UK Head Office:
101 Finsbury Pavement, Moorgate, London, EC2A 1RS 

International Headquaters: 
World Class Group Consultants INC (WCGCI) company no. 134519 Mayfair Trust Group Limited, Second floor, Capital City, Independence Avenue, P.O. Box 1312, Victoria, Mahè, Republic of Seychelles.

 

I can find no trace of the company in its own right and there is little uK tracability 

 

If the Company is known to you do you have any details of its senior managment so I can contact them to validate their authenticity as part of some due dilligence I am doing as a client who wishes to invest in them

 

Regards John
