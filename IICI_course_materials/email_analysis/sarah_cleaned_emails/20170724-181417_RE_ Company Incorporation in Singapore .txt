Dear Customer,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please clarify the below details so that we may advise you accordingly:

 

-Where is the investment coming from and will this be paid into the bank account

It is coming from Slovenia, it will be bank account to bank account 

 

-Will the bank account be used for anything else, or is there an option for you to use a different bank account or escrow provider if the account is only being used for the investment and therefore bring down the cost of the company.

Basically maybe escrow provider is ok, but I don’t have that option. 

 

-Is there a specific reason for it being a Singapore company?

Well, because I am buying Singapore company..do you have any other better alternative?

 

 

The problem with Singapore is that it’s an open registry with accounts required, and therefore for a nominee to take a position and open a bank account they must ensure they are compensated enough should they become responsible for the company if the UBO(ultimate beneficial owner) absconds.

 

We can’t reduce the cost as we have to cover all the fees for the local partners to provide the address, director, secretary, bank forms and other required forms with us

 

The minimum for this solution would be £6000 and we would require payment before the end of the month

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Best Regards,

 

Sarah

Hi, Sarah,

A company is ment to be only a SPV special purpose vehicle to invest  some funds (100k€) and buy another Singapore company – a start-up which is valued at almost nothing - 1SGD and capitalise it to 100k€.

There will be no trading, SPV should get profits at the end of business year – there is a possibility that we will merge SPV with the start up.

6500gbp is a lot for that purpose. J

Hope you can come up with some better solution

Best, Matjaz
