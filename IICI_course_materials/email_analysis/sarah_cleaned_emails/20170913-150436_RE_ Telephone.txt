Hey Sarah, 

 

So we have emailed the bank if they will open account still waiting for them to get back to me. 

 

We have all his docs here and we will have to hold on to them until we hear back from them if the originals are required or not. We are working on the situation.  

 

As soon as they will get back I will update you. 

 

Thanks

Dear Sarah,

 

I tried to call you today several times to discuss my requests, and I have had no response. 

 

Can you please either call me on 02078460332 or email me to update me with regards to all my requests made last week.

 

I await your response.

 

Kind regards

 

Ross
