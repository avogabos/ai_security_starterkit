Dear Rachel and Sarah,

I received information from our accounts department that there are two invoices remain outstanding from your company as at today's date.  Please find attached a statement of account for your attention.

As we know that your company has a very good payment history, and that there is an invoice which is unpaid for more than one year.  In this connection, may I ask for your kind assistance to forward the same to your accounts department for checking?  If payment have been arranged for that invoice, kindly provide a copy of your payment advice for our checking. Alternatively, please send us the payment details once the payment is made so that we may update our accounts department.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact us.

Best regards,
Nim
