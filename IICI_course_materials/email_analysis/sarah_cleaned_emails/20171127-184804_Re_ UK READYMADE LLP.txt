Please

                    VAT.
                    The cost of our Readymade LLPs is GBP 10,000 as the
                    companies are 6 years old
                    Active and clean companies  with a good credit
                    report and up-to-date

Yes,
                      the BVI companies can be partners in the LLP.
                      However, you
                      will need to appoint at least 1 human director in
                      the LLP. The partners will
                      pay tax on their individual income(including
                      profit received from
                      partnership).
