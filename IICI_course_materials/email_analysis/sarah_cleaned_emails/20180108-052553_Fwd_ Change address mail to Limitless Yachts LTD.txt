Dear  Sarah
Please i need to know what happen now that we changed the company name and director:

<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 23px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(66, 133, 244);">-with the variation of the name does not change as registration? is not it like creating a new company right?
everything is the same ...
-the boat headed to the company, automatically changes the name of the company owner right?</span>
