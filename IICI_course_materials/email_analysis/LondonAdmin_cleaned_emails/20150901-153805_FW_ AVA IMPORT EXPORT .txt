Dear Nadya,

 

Please file the form DS-01 for this company in which you are the director.
You would need to sign it. Charlotte has confirmed that we will not charge
the customer for this as mentioned in the emails mentioned below.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Michael

Dear Charlotte,

 

Should we ask the customer to make a bank transfer or will we file the
dissolution free of cost on his behalf.

 

Kind regards,

 

Michael

We have received the email below from the above mentioned customer. He has
visited Companies House to submit the DS-01 form but they have refused to
accept the form as he is not the director in the company. He has purchased
natural person nominee director service and Nadya is appointed as the
director in this company. Please advise.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Michael

Hello,

 

I have been told I cannot strike off the company as I am not the director.
Kindly help me to reset my account so I can book the strike off service, the
account email is:

 

 <mailto:lutz@bantuba.com> lutz@bantuba.com

 

I try to reinstate via "lost password" but the password sent via email also
don't work and it appears I have 3 different customer IDs?

 

This is what I get via email:

 

                               71202346

                               86UOYTPW14

 

                               91202349
