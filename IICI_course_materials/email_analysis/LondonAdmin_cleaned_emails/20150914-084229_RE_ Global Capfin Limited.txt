Dear Nadya,
I attach our invoice with the duly apostilled document for your settlement.  Please let me know when your client will come to pick up the same.
Do I also need to pass the stamped original Bought Sold Note, Instrument of Transfer and NC3 to your client?
I await hearing from you.
Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nadya,



I confirm receipt of the original NNC3 and Bought and Sold Notes of Global Capfin Limited.



I will proceed to file to Company Registry and IRD.  After filing the same, I will also arrange Alfred to notarize true copies and send to High Court for apostille.  Please confirm if we only need to apostille the NNC3 and Bought and Sold Notes or with all the company documents, includes NNC1, AA, CI and BR?



I await hearing from you.
