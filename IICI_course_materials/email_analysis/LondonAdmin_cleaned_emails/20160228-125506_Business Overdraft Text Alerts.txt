Coming soon to a mobile phone screen near you, alerts that could help you to avoid paying informal overdraft fees and interest

We're launching our new Business Overdraft Text Alerts service from mid-March 2016.

These alerts will notify you when we've agreed an informal overdraft1. If your account is back in credit or within your formal limit by 23:45 on the same day, you'll avoid informal overdraft fees and interest.

These alerts are free of charge and you'll receive them automatically providing we hold a UK mobile number for you, so you dont need to register to benefit from this service. If you haven't provided us your mobile number before or if it has changed, call us2 and we'll update our records.

If you don't want to receive these alerts, call us and we'll update your preferences and opt you out of the service.
