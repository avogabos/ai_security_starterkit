Sorry Oliver, but these documents are incorrect once again - it should be "Enterprise Partnership Limited" as it is a limited company. The "Limited" was omitted". This company owns Atlantic Private Bank Ltd. The share certificate for the Atlantic Bank was also incorrect as it also omitted the "Limited" in the name. 

 

In order to not cause extra work for you, I didn't say anything to the client about the share certificate and hadn't noticed the A & E also had the same mistake.

 

In any case, these documents for Enterprise are not a hurry, whereas the documents for RS Bank & Centurion Banks very much are - so please give priority to those rather than the Enterprise A& E and share certificate.

 

Best,

 

Michael
