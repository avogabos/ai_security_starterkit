Yes, Companies House informed that a penalty of GBP 750 has to be paid with
restoration for 2015 accounts which Is why Nadya is asking to provide her
the letter that we must have received and emailed to this client as he has
our registered office address service. She needs it for her reference as
this reseller might ask her for it.

 

Pls have someone look into it and email the letter to Nadya on
londonadmin@formationshouse.com. Thanks
