Dear Charlotte,

This customer had purchased the apostile express Order No. 190078 (300 GBP). The apostile was not delivered on time. Hence he has requested for a refund of 150 GBP. I have already inform him that we would maintain a credit amount of 150 GBP as per Rachel’s instructions but he insists he wants a refund.
 
Please find below email received from customer.
 
Awaiting your reply in this regard.
 
Thanks & Regards,
 
Michael

Dear Sir/Madam,you have done it beforein our account, so technically is possible. Furthermore , we have paid youfor a service that you did not deliver and thus we insist on getting our money back NOW. I would suggest you to reconsider , otherwise we will take all possible legal actions against your company and inform the authorities. It is illegal and even a fraud to keep money that do notbelong to you.Please reconsider.BR
