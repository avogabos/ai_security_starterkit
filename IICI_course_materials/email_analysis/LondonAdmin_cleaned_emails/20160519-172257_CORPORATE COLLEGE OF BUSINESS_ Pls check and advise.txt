Hey Nadya! This customer is has requested the following:

but from the end 2016 we plan to start the business. One of our partners
requires the business plan (please see 2 files attached) certified by a
third party.

 

Documentsubmitted should be certified by corporate service
provider/management company or by a
notary/advocate/lawyer/solicitor/practicing accountant; with the
stampbearing the certifier's name, position, signature and contact details.
Certification should be in English with the wordings "Originalsighted",
"Certified true copy" or similar.

 

I'll be thankful if the document  (attached) will be certifiedby the
Formations House stuff. The certified scanned copy is OK.
