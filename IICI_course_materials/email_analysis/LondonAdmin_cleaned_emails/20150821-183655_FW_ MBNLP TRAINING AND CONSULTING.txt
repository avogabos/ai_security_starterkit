Good morning Felix,

 

Before Marcelo comes to the UK, I need to see the business plan, to see why
Mr. Buglione is coming to the UK to register his business.

 

In the welcome back I sent to you yesterday with the change of date, it will
have the business plan details that are provided.


I will need this ASAP in order to avoid any delays or extra expense.

 

Thank you

 

Hayley
