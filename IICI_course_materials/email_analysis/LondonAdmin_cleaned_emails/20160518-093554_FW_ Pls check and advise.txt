Good Morning,

This is your client Massimo Severoni. I got two requests and I hope you could help me:

1)      I got a problem with the bank account of SUCCESS CONSULTANCY SUPPORT LTD.

Here follow the account details: Account No 00278786; Sortcode: 16-0109.

I need to access to online banking but i never received any log-in credentials and infos. I never received the card as well (no membership number or any other tools in order to operate on my account). The company address is: 29 Harley Street - Suite B, W1G 9QR London.

The Bank is RBS in Cavendish Square. I tried to contact the RBS Business Branch but I never received any answer. Could you please help me to reach inormations about status of my bank account? Could you please act as delegate and check my position in RBS?

 2)  ) I ordered an RBS card reader addressed to Gold Wall Solutions Limited. It should be delivered within few days in 29 Harley Street. Can you please let me know when it will be arrived?

 Thank you very much in advance

 

Best Regards

Massimo Severoni
