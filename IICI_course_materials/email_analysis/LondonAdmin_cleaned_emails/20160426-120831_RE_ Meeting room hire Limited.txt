Dear Sam,

 

We prepared the drinks tray ready and you mentioned you would let us know
when you wanted it as you were awaiting the guests.

The internet issue we showed was down to your device and not our service as
at that time not only did we put a new router in the room, we also checked
that a number of us using the same wifi router could get to your website.

 

The room is a dark wood panelled room as it always has been, the nature of
the room is that it can be a little dark. The room is typically cooler than
most meeting spaces and this has never been raised as a comment before, as
you have had previous meetings in the same room with the same heating, I
cannot accept that you felt the room was significantly too cold and neither
did you come and request additional heating or lighting. 

 

In terms of booking, we were given the booking and we reserved the room. We
are unaware of any of your issues in booking the room. The only thing we
were additionally requested was that you would have access to the room
earlier, and we allowed this without charge.

While here you did not mention this problem either.

 

You are requested to settle the invoice in full. In future you should
request any additional requirements and we shall let you know if we are
unable to meet them. 

The building is being updated and from May 2016 the room rate will increase
to £45 + VAT per hour.

 

Kind Regards

Nadya Crawford

Hi Nadya,

 

the room was cold, there was not sufficient lighting, I asked for someone to
check on 

us for drinks and nothing happened, the internet was unusably slow. It took
30 minutes and 3 phone calls to book the room!!

 

Nothing was fit for purpose. The only thing that has been done effectively
is sending me an invoice.

 

The service has been good in the past.

 

I will settle 50% of the invoice as a gesture of good will.

 

S
