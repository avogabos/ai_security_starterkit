Hi Nadya                   

                    

When is deadline for Companies house ?                   

If we are short of time, then keep all as it is and we change later this year.

Hi Paul,         

          

Please confirm who the director of the company will be and who the shareholder will be. We need this in writing from you.          

Also we need a copy of passport and utility bill no older than 3 months for the new member of the company.         

          

          

Kind regards

Hi Nadya                   

                             

In regards to our meeting Friday, the new CEO of Woodconnection is Yanis Louanou his phone is +44 7856 822722. Can you please contact him in regards to the documentation you need for the change.                             

If annual return have to be send in and you can't change the CEO now, then we must do this later to avoid penalties etc.                            

                             

Best regards                             

                             

Woodconnection LTD
