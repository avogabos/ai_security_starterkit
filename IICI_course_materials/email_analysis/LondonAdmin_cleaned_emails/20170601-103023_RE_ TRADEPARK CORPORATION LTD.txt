Dear Nadya,

Thank you for your email.

Our fee is HK$5,000, and we estimate we will need to pay for 2015-2016, 2016-2017 BR fees and court penalty around 3000-5000, so I ask for HK$15000 costs on account.

Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nadya,

I remember that we assisted you for notarizing and apostille some company documents for Tradepark Corporation, but did not had your instruction to pay the BR fee for the said company.

We propose to charge HK$5,000 exclusive of disbursements, i.e. BR fee, court fee, etc. for attending the hearing and settle the BR fees and penalty.

If you agree with our above fee quotation, please let us have HK$15,000 costs of account to defray our fees and disbursements.

I await hearing from you and if you have any query, please feel free to let us know.

Regards,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

Rachel is not in the office today. Please see attached.

We presumed that we had already paid for the period that they are asking for through you organisation? Perhaps this was missed due to the fact we had changed agents. We cannot attend and would just like to pay the outstanding amount.

Please advise.
I look forward to hearing from you.
