Dear Marc,
I have spoken with the bank and they have confirmed they have everything they need for you to be added to the account, FINALLY! They said to expect letter with all details and new log ins etc. in the post within 5/7 working days.
Currently all mail for INTERWEB comes to me so as soon as I have it I will email you and post it out.
Kind regards
Nadya

Dear Marc,
I managed to get through to Edric who is dealing with the change of mandate, however he has still not received it!!!
The guy who took your ID on the 21 June at the Cavendish square branch said that he clearly addressed it to Edric Mumbonye. Apparently they are supposed to keep a copy at their Cavendish square branch but because of the refurbishment he cannot seem to find it as it has been moved. I am livid.
I will be going back to the branch this afternoon for them to look for it until they find it and fax it straight to Edric.
Kind regards
Nadya
