Dear Fabian, 

 

It was a pleasure to meet you earlier this afternoon. Please see attached documents. The original Certificate of Incorporation I can give to you tomorrow. 

 

I am currently talking to some certified translators so hopefully something can be done tomorrow in the morning. 

 

The bank statement and the bank reference letter you have the originals with you I presume? As you will need to present them when you go there.

 

I would also advise that you get your ID card notarised with them also. 

 

I will send a separate email over to you shortly with the details.

 

Kind regards

Nadya
