Hi Charlotte, 

I hope youâ€™re well and had a good Xmas and Chinese New year this week.

I wondered do you have a the formally stamped share transfer document confirming the transfer back to Albion Outlook Ltd the 1 share Worldwide Ventures Ltd had in our Hong Kong company to set it up? 

Grateful if you could email me a copy asap please. 

Many thanks!

Kind regards,
Dai
