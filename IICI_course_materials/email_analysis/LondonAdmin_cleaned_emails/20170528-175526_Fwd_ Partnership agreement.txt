This will be pasted onto my legal if you wish not to comply .

My business plan comes first which you said you have in order to speak with my financial team on where exactly your are with it, once the Cc takes place tmr as you discarded last weeks CC,  you will then be flown to the Uk thereafter to proceed 2nd stage of funding and finish off the BP requested with my guidance.

11 wks for a BP i think you've had enough time to secure your ideas to the world and myself who has no guarantee but your word that this will work.( I took your word )

As your biz partner funder Iv delivered you enough time without any pressure to see what you have to submit to Franco who's takes care of my financials and we would advice you on the right Track with the next generation AR /VR.

Up until this point Iv trusted you to deliver a BP, so an exit to all your wonderers views works both ways.
If you have the minerals do address BP this is your final chance to do so and proceed 2nd funding.

I will not at any point be funding not another penny unless you  reveal what you have been working. For over 11 wks.

The conference call tmr will show you where u need to be and where we all need to get, your funding will starts thereafter not before Mr Craig Reginald Gafoor.

Crunch time Mr Gafoor

Sorry Jon

You simply do not seem to understand the situation i have been placed in currently nor what i am having to do like sell my mixer to raise funds,

Monday other things i am placing currently in place kick in and i will be back on another path again and shall look into other options for symbiant
If need be this will be via someone i know have a tech hedge fund worth 200 mil she has access to i have known for years on end of season when all assets i would like for a presentation are raised .. like a full BP and also P&L with a full VR 360 movie n AR for mobile as i stated i wished to create before.
Currently i am making opportunities as a fall back plan kicks in Monday as which point i shall have no time to deal with this all for a bit till i get my life path back in order.

I suggest if you are serious to step in now and send funding for my time as agreed plus accommodation or simply wish me well and exit these talks as nothing that was talked on between us from your side is in place in my day today which will be a hard one .. just like they have been for 3 weeks due to what i can only think of as some form of break down in basic respect for me as a person and what i expect around me to wake up to.

Good day Jon

You have till Monday.

Regards
Mr Craig Reginald Gafoor

Dear Jon

As you seem unable to keep to the deals in place or for-fill your agreements with myself we shall exit looking into our partnership at 12pm mid day GMT Monday 29th at which point please refer to the terms of the NDA and expect formal notice of this of exit in talks to be given.

I had hoped we could find common ground but after taking the time to listen to your valid points no middle ground was to be talked on from your end to continue our talks.
If you care to rethink your position to the point it has worth to me on my life path by Monday please feel most free to reach out.

I wish you well.

Mr Craig Reginald Gafoor.

Dear Craig,

These are your procedures:

You shall sign Franco's  NDA & return then Monday I have the CC meeting set regarding your present business plan, this is the only time u will get to speak with him as I have it set for this day.

After the meeting has been concluded you will both revert back to me on the same day to see what is needed for the B.P.

There will be no talks about funding until this takes place on Monday.

There will be no other agreements signed until the BP is bullet proof.

We will then have another talk thereafter.

I'm not executing so that you know.

Dear Jon

In regards to the current state of this contract of biz partnership may as i ask the following agreed items be placed into this doc for clarity in  duties and tasks.

1 20,000 euro funding in a joint account before leaving for japan to set up the company.
2 2 million euros of funding is to be raised for the Jan 1st 2018 start date for project.
3 all tech and Tokyo staffing is within the remit of my own duty's

This should be added to the section in regards to your stated duties to form a partnership and company with myself.
Currently as this biz partnership doc stands all that is needed to own the rights to Symbiant and its concepts is zero funding and my signature.

This needs to be resolved and stated in the docs sent as above to sign off.
Currently to sign this agreement without funding from your side as agreed is not possible, as to do so would sign off on the rights to all concepts i have come up with over years of hard work,
I would not be able to exit the company without 2 years notice also.

We can continue talks on the details of this contract once the above as you stated you are able to action from your side is signed off on.

Currently we shall be exiting our NDA agreement on Monday 29th May 2018 unless resolution is found on the terms agreed when i left Vienna.
At such point all documents and emails plus any form of communication with us is to be destroyed as per the NDA terms and exit.

Due to unacceptable living conditions in Ibiza and breach of verbal agreements to free up my time to run you through my assets in a civil environment the 2 items below need to be resolved to continue our movement as agreed before i left Vienna,

By this weekend:
1 a home as clean as was left in Vienna.
2 funds to cover my costs while working.

If any of the above you need clarity in please feel free to reply to this email.
Currently all is being asked is things agreed to upon before taking the path of seeing if we are able to form a company.

When the above has been actioned as it should be I will be more than happy to open up communication channels with Franco and very much look forwards to his insight into the formation of Symbiant.

Fond Regards

Mr Craig Reginald Gafoor.
