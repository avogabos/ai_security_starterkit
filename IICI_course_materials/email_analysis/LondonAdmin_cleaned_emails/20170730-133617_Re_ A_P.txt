Hi Piero,
Please find attached Invoice for what you need to pay now so that we can prepare and file the Dormant Accounts electronically as soon as possible.
Please let me know once done so that we can get your company back to good standing.
For all other services/renewals will not expire until August. Please check my previous email with all the services you hold with us currently and let me know what you would like to renew and I will then prepare the correct invoice.
Kind regards
