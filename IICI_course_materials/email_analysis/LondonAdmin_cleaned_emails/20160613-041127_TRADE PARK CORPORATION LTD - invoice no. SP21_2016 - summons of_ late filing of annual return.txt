Subject: RE: TRADE PARK CORPORATION LTD - summons of late filing of annual return

Dear Nadya

We usually file the annual return before the due date unless we cease to provide service to a company.

You may call the officer of the Companies Registry and request for the withdrawal of the court hearing as the annual return was filed.

For cost saving reason, we usually do not attend to the court hearing.  The court sends the demand note of the penalty to the Company in due course.   Upon receipt of the demand note, please arrange for the payment of penalty.

If you would like us to attend to the court hearing and arrange for the payment of penalty, our service fee is HK$7,000 (US$909) excluding any related disbursements e.g. penalty, travelling expense and etc.  Please arrange to wire transfer the cost on account of say, HK$20,000 (US$2,597) to our following bank account under advice to us:

Name of Banker:          HSBC, Hong Kong
                                    Hong Kong Main Branch
                                    HSBC Main Building
                                    1 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong
Account Name:           OLN Corporate Services Limited
Account No.:                808-041297-001
Swift Code:                 HSBCHKHHHKH
Ref.:                              Cost on account of Trade Park Corporation Ltd

Any surplus will be kept as cost on account for future expenses.

We are also please to arrange for the payment of penalty in due course.  Our service fee is HK$3,000 excluding any related disbursements.

Please let us have your further instruction.  Thanks.
