Hi Billy,

Yes, that is the wording from Bhavesh's initial request.

The Seychelles lawyer needs to provide a letter addressed Wilsher Holdings Limited confirming that:


1.       they have carried out all necessary company searches with the Seychelles Registrar of Companies; and

2.       they have reviewed and settled the corporate authorisations of Fairway Carlyle Corporation; and

3.       confirm that, in their opinion, Fairway Carlyle Corporation own the property and can enter in to a contract to sell it and that the attached transfer deed has been properly executed and is, in their opinion, enforceable.

Kind regards

Sarah
