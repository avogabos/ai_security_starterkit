Hi Nadya,


Hope you enjoyed your time outside of the office.


The account for Mr Buglione is close to becoming active. Compliancy might come back with some additional requests but for now it looks good.

Hi Jaap,
Sorry for the delay I have been away from the office.
If you see the letter from the Bank, UniCredit, confirming his address and Identity details which are attached on pages 3 and 4.
I have also attached a copy of a recent bank statement.
Please let me know if this is sufficient.
Kind regards
Nadya
