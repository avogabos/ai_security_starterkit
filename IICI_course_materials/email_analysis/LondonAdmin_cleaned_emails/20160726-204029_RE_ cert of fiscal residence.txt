This was the last time I applied for a tax residency certificate .. A very
long time ago. so the procedure, I expect has changed, most likely.
currently looking into it and getting lost. this is a job for the accounts
team surely!??! 

 

Client will have to provide the following information before we write to
HMRC

 

1.       The name of the country for which the Certificate if required for
and the reason why it is required. 

 

2.       The source of the income for which the Certificate is required. The
most common sources of income are business profits, dividends, interest and
royalties. 

 

 

3.       Confirmation of the period for which the Certificate is required,
if not for the date on which the certificate is to be issued. Please note
that we cannot issue a certificate for a period ending on a future date. 

 

4.       If required by the specific Double Taxation Agreement - 

a.       Confirmation that the company is the beneficial owner of the income
in respect of which the certificate is required. The company should be the
legal owner of the income and does not receive the income as an agent or
nominee on behalf of a third party

b.      Confirmation that all the income will be subject to United Kingdom
Corporation Tax.
