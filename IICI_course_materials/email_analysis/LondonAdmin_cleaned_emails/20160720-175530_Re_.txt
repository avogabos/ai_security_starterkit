I will examine if in the forms i filledin there are discrepancies between
my lectricity bill and what i filled in.

Anyway the way of rec ation now of RBS is totaly unpeofessional. Maybe
Brexitt will stillbring traditional pple to work less inefficient as before.
I hope on your positive intervention  at least on Friday;

Dear Marc,
I am doing everything possible to make this bank transfer over to you. It is not in our/my interest to keep it at all!
It has turned into a very unfortunate situation with the bank being extremely unprofessional.
I spoke with Edric at RBS and he is calling the mandate change team to see what the problem is and is calling me back today. He is saying there are some issues with the address which he is going to try and resolve.
I have expressed to them the urgency many many times and have told them how terrible their service is and the poor communication between departments. I asked for him to call you but because you still haven’t been added to the account he says that they can only speak to me currently. It is very upsetting.
As soon as I hear from them I will call you back right away.
Kind regards
Nadya

Dear Nadya,
I dont want to lose MINE credibilty to my cleints.
It is not to me to solve your poblem with RBS but Fomations House self.
We know all that teh service of formations house is very BAD when you consult google.
My client let me know this today.
So i ask your immediate reply in the next few hours before end of the day.
If not i will take steps internatiionaly.
Marc
