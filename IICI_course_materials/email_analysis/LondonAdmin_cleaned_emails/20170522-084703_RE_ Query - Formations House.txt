Dear Nadya,

Our fee is HK$2200 per company for a Notarial Certificate cover less than 10 company documents.  Our fee is exclusive of disbursement, i.e. company search fee, courier and other misc expense, if any.

For KYC requirement of HSBC and Nominee Directors issues, do you prefer me to forward your email to our Company Secretary department for their quotation?

Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,
We have a new client who will be visiting Hong Kong in a few weeks.
We will be registering a Hong Kong company for him and would like to know what the cost will be for 2 apostilles
And if you know the KYC requirements for HSBC bank in Hong Kong?
I also wanted to ask if your company offer Nominee Director and or Nominee Secretary services for Hong Kong companies where there is a joint UK director for the Hong Kong company.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya
