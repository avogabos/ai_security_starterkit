Dear Charlotte,
happy new year first of all !

Three issues:
1) Some news on the Gazette ?
2) Phone/Fax number in Gambia ?
3) Still waiting for Tax Certificate and Certificate of Incumbancy for SUISSE TRADE LTD !

Beside this i have NOT received any original documents so far from this new company (share certificate, articles of association, certificate of
incorporation)

kind regards,
