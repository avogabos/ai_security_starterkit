Dear Mr. Kuhn, 

 

I tried calling you on the 0203 457 2690 but it went through to Croydon office. I was told I could email you. 

Would it be possible to book an appointment for something like 10.30 tomorrow please? It will be just one standard set of company documents, I think it will be Danielle who will be bringing them in.

 

Kind regards
