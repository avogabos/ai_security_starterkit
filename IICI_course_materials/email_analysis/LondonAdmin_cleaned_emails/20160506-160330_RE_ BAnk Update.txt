Nadya,

 

Not a problem I will get in touch with him, Just need to understand the process. After you send the documents to the bank what’s the estimated time they get back to us or the client directly and if all the documents are ok than what’s the next process, Me understanding this will help me assist the client.

 

Thanks in Advance for your help.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

I’m not going to talk to him there is nothing to update him on. You’re the account manager, I’m very fragile at the moment unfortunately so if I was to talk to him I would probably start crying.

 

Yes there is nothing from stopping him transferring the money into the account in EUROS it will just get converted into pounds with their exchange rate! 

 

I cannot apply for a euro account as I’m being taken off the account. Once he has been appointed as the signatory on the account, they will send him the correct form.

I just want to know if we can invoice clients already in Euro's with the existing RBS account. I wait urgently for that.
