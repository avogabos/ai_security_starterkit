Dear Sirs,

I would like to inform you that some changes have appeared in the bank
forms.
From now on for all the clients you should use the new bank forms which you
may find attached to this e-mail:

I draw your attention that we shall not accept the previous version of the
Bank forms signed (dated) in June 2015.

I would like also to remind you about the requirements of minimum balance:
1. 5 000 EUR  (or the equivalent in another currency) for group A: companies
from the EU, CIS, OECD, China (incl. Hong Kong), Andorra, Georgia,
Lichtenstein, Macedonia, Isle of Man, Serbia, Singapore and Montenegro.
2. 10 000 EUR (or the equivalent in another currency) for group B: companies
from all other countries.

Pay attention that a client has to cover account opening fee within 3 months
after the account has been activated: 250 EUR (group A) and 550 EUR (group
B).The account opening fee will be debited from the first transfer made to
the account of the client.
Client should secure the minimum balance within 3 months (or at once) after
he has covered account opening fee.

Should you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
