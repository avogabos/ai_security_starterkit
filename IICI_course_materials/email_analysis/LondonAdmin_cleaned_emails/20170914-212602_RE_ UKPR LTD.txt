Hi, 

 

Please could you sort this out?

 

They really need to get the virtual mailing address as we are getting bank
statements from them here and they need to hurry up take my name off the
account

additionally the account is now NIL

and they need to tt something into it asap

 

as the bank takes 5.00 per month as a business maintenance fee
