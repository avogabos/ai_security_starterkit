Hi Nadya

 

I am attaching a share certificate, please print it and send it to the following address, it is a Gambian company

Registered through FH

 

Dear Oliver,

 

Can you please send the original of Mats' new share certificate directly to him. This will save time rather than to send it to us to then resend to Mats. You can send by regular air mail post as I already sent him the electronic version which he can use for immediate needs.

 

This is his address:

 

Mr. Mats Hartling
East Assets Plc
Falstaff House
Station Road
Sutterton
Boston
Lincolnshire
PE20 2JH 

United Kingdom

 

Many thanks & Kind regards,

 

Konstantin.
