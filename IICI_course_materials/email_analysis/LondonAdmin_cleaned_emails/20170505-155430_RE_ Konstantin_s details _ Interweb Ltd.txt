Dear Nadya,

Many thanks for the below and apologies it took a while to respond, it was a hectic day.

I asked my colleagues to make the changes. Also, could you please confirm when the last VAT return was submitted by yourselves for Interweb and up until what date their bookkeeping was being done by Formations House please?

Best regards,

Konstantin
