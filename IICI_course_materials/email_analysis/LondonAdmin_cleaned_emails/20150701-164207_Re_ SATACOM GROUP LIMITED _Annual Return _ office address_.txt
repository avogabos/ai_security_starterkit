Dear Rachel,

thank you for your answer.

As for address, we specially ordered other address then Harley Street,
but we got it from you and renewed from you during last years.
I think i ordered it with help manager Katya in 2011.

Can you check maybe its one of your additional reg.address and its possible
to renew
it with your help? Cause we did it all the time.
