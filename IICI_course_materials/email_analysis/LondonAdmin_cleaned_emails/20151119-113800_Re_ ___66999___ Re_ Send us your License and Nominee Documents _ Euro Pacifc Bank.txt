Hi Nadya,

Compliance came back to me on this. They asked about Formations House T/A 
Accounts Centre Limited. There wouldn't be any type of DBA document showing 
that Accounts Centre Limited is DBA Formations House?

I was about to send them this link: 
http://www.formationshouse.com/terms_and_conditions.htm

...as I see at the bottom of the page it mentions "Formations House is a 
Division of Centre Ltd"

Should that read "Accounts Centre Ltd" or is "Centre Ltd" a different 
company altogether?

Apologies for any inconvenience, just want to be sure to relay the correct 
information to Compliance. Your help is most appreciated! Let me know if we 
should hop on a quick call to discuss. Thank you!

Kind Regards,
Matt K.

Hi Matt,

The only thing that we can provide you is that Formations House has the same 
trading address and Accounts Centre Limited, shown on our website:

http://www.formationshouse.com/contact-us.html

We do not actually have an official document for Formations House as it is 
not a registered company but T/A Accounts Centre Ltd.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Nadya

Hi Nadya,

Our compliance team approached me asking about Accounts Centre Ltd trading 
as Formations House Ltd. Would there be any type of documentation or website 
that I can provide to them that would demonstrate the relationship of the 
two companies?
