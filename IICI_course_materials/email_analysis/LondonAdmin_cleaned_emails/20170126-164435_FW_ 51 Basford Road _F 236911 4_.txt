Hi Billy,

 

Yes, that is the wording from Bhavesh's initial request.

 

The Seychelles lawyer needs to provide a letter addressed Wilsher Holdings
Limited confirming that:

 

1.	they have carried out all necessary company searches with the
Seychelles Registrar of Companies; and
2.	they have reviewed and settled the corporate authorisations of
Fairway Carlyle Corporation; and
3.	confirm that, in their opinion, Fairway Carlyle Corporation own the
property and can enter in to a contract to sell it and that the attached
transfer deed has been properly executed and is, in their opinion,
enforceable.

 

Kind regards

 

Sarah
