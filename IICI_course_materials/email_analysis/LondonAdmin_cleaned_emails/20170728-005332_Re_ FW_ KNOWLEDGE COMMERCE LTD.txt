Dear Manvinder,
Please could you kindly confirm how you would like us to take the payment for the attached invoice?
Also our accounts team are asking to see the copy of the CT600 and the last accounts that were submitted to HMRC and Companies House, the originally prepared documents not what can be downloaded from the internet, your previous accountants should have this?
We look forward to hearing from you.
