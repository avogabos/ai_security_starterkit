Hi Nadya,

 

I hope all is well with you.

 

This customer had requested us earlier to send out the incorporation docs to
the DHL office in Khartoum - Sudan where he would pay at the time of
collection. You said that this was possible. Customer has not paid us any
amount as he would be paying at the time of collection from the DHL office
in Khartoum, Sudan. He has provided his telephone number below as per your
request. The address provided is his home address but he prefers to collect
it from the DHL Office.

 

Mentioned below is the address of the DHL office in Khartoum, Sudan.

 

DHL Express

House # 10 blk 1/15 nigomi street

0183-777135- 777500

 

There is only one office in this city.

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael
