Dear Ravi,

 

I am away next week but Nadya or Danielle can take the funds,

 

The costs are as follows: 

$4500 Solicitor plus $500 for disbursements during the application = $5000
USD = £3400

Registered Address, Agent, Government fees 2008  2015 plus one COGS: total
$8,500 USD = 5575 GBP

 

We cannot accept less than this as these are our direct costs.

 

You paid me £915 to do a new company and therefore a balance of £8060 GBP is
needed for us to restore the company.

 

Thanks

 

Charlotte

Hi Ravi

 

Slight problem, have a response from the solicitor and its not good

 

Kindly note that the Registry will not allow for the re-use of a name
already in existence until after 10 years of the date of dissolved.  They
would also need to know the reason for requesting the change of name.

 

 

They also wont backdate any document, so please decide how you would like me
to proceed

 

Thanks
