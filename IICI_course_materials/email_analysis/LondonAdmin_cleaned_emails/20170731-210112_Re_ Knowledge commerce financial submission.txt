Hi Charlotte

That's the only card you can use or I can come and pay in cash.

Hi Nadya
I came to see you on Friday but nobody opened the door. Also left message for you on Thuresday.
On Friday your new number was also not working
Can you advise what's the best way to contact you
Accounts have to be submitted ASAP.
Regards
Manvinder
