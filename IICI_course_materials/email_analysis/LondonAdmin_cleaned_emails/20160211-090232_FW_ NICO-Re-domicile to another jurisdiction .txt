Dear Charlotte

 

Good afternoon

 

Thank you for seeing me on Thursday.

 

1-As stated in our meeting the above name client company wishes to re-domicile to another jurisdiction as soon as possible.

 

2-To that end we need to provide as many as documents which will be required for this purpose. 

 

3-It may be the case that some of these documents cannot be provided and/or some of the requirements cannot be met. 

 

4-What is important here is to keep the client informed without delay of any issues. 

 

5-Would you please arrange for the following documents to be uploaded to the Register and pass worded : farhad

a)      Singed MOA and AOA attached;

b)      Register of directors attached;

c)       Register of members;

d)      Registered agent certificate;

e)      Certificate of Good Standing.

 

6-Kindly note that the following documents are already on the Icommerce Registry:

·         The unsigned version of MOA/AOA; password :farhad. We need to upload the signed version of MOA and AOA and put the  password :farhad on it and delete the unsigned version from the registry

·         Certificate of Continuance: Unable to Verify the document . Pls activate verification and put password of: farhad

·         Certificate of incorporation; Pass word: farhad. This is OK

·         Share certificate: password: farhad . This is OK.

 

 

7-RE-Domicile to NEVIS

 

For example the following documents are required to re-domicile the Company to Nevis

 

1.      Along with the “Application for Transfer of Domicile”, the Nevis Financial Services requires the following be filed in duplicate

·        a certified copy of the existing Articles of Incorporation, Memorandum or other instrument defining the constitution of the corporation (include the initial Bylaws if they were filed at the time of incorporation). I believe the certification can be done by the Registered Agent.

·        a certificate of good standing (dated within the last 3 months). Pls arrange for this to be uploaded to the Registry

·        a certified copy of the certificate of incorporation. Pls activate certificate of continuance and put password word of: farhad. I believe the certification can be done by the Registered Agent

2.      All foreign jurisdiction documents must be Apostilled by that local government. I think the best that can be done is certification through the Registered Agent in Netherlands.

3.      If the Company will continue to operate under the same name, after being re-domiciled to Nevis, we must ensure that the name is "available" from our end i.e. The company name does not already exist on the company registry.  We will reserve the name in Nevis.

4.      Directors resolutions stating 

·        The company declares “that the transfer of domicile is made in good faith and will not serve to hinder, delay or defraud existing shareholders, creditors, claimants or other parties in interest", We will arrange for this.

·        " this transfer of domicile to Nevis shall not affect any obligations or liabilities of ABC Company Limited, incurred prior to said transfer" We will arrange for this

5.      After the application has been processed, FinServ would issue a Certificate of Continuation which will be sent to the foreign jurisdiction authorities who would then issue the Certificate of Discontinuance. We need to request in the Company’s application that the certificate of continuance be issued to the Registered Agent office address in Netherlands.

 

 

I would be grateful for any comments/suggestions you may have and to  deal promptly with the sections that can be done by your organization.

 

Please keep me informed.

 

Knd Regards

Farhad
