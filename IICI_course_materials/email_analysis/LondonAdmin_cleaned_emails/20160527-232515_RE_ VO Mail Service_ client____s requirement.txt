Hi Denise

Hello

 

I am the Strategy Director of a new start up

We decided a Harley St address might be useful. Having a meeting room as a back up to the meeting rooms at my club (RSM) would be advantageous 

My issue is the 50p region page for scanning in post.

In years gone by when scanners cost £000's, yes a very high premium was understandable.

I would be willing to pay on a time basis, from opening the letters, to the end of the scan job, but if I get a 30 page sales brochure dressed up as medical research ( very common) I would be furious to pay anything.

So, we would buy Infinioffice today for a year if you are able to accept that the pricing model needs adjustment. I do not want to waste your time by you suggesting, say, 40p per page, but all the other ( except for the few streets around Harley St) charge on a time and per penny basis.

If you are unable to accept that paying maybe £600 pm for scanning 60 pages a day, ( that in my £80 scanner takes under 3 minutes)  is excessive, I respect your decision.

I am sure you also appreciate we are unable to recover the VAT, so 50p is 60p

Regards

Mr David A Steene

Hi Denise and Nadya

 

Hope you are doing well.

 

I have a client for Virtual Office Mail Service, who would like his mails to be scanned and forwarded to him by email.

 

Client would like to know the cost and turnaround time by asking for example if we receive 50 mails (envelops) with ‘X’ number of pages on Monday morning, what will be cost for scanning (per page) and emailing (per envelop) and in how many hours or days he will receive all the pages from these 50 envelops?

 

This is just an example that client has given, as it is a startup, therefore initially there will be lesser mails.

 

Please advice as soon as possible, client is in hurry and need service as soon as possible. Will be ordering service for 12 months, will also use Phone and Fax service and also has shown interest in meeting rooms.

 

Thank you.
