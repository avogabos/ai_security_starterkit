Hi Riz, 

 

There is no appointment once I get the forms from HSBC (within the next 3-5
working days) then I fill out my section and he fills his out, he will then
have to go with the form and his passport and most recent bank statement
showing his address to the Oxford Street Branch. 

 

I suggest he comes to our office either on the 8th or 9th March he fills out
the form here and then I will take him to the Bank with everything and they
will verify the ID. 

 

Please ensure he gets a virtual office mailing address if he hasn't done so
already.

 

Many thanks 

 

Nadya
