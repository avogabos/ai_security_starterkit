Dear Ms Pawar, 

 

Please be advised that I have taken over this case and I am fully aware of
all previous correspondence. We have two options 

 

1) to close the account as you have mentioned to which we require a written
letter of authority from yourself to close the account. 

 

2) Mr Semir Kimyonok is added as a signatory, and have yourself removed by
completing forms. These can be forwarded to yourself once you have decided.
Please confirm your preferred course of action as soon as possible. 

 

Regards,

 

Nadia Mirza
