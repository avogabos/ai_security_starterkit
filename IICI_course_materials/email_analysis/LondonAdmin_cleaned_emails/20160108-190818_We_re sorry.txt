Dear Customer

I would like to say sorry for the inconvenience and frustration that you may have experienced as a result of our recent Online banking issues.

Our Online banking services are now working and we are monitoring them closely.

I want to reassure you that this was not a cyber attack. The problems experienced were due to internal issues and at no time was your data at risk.

If you experienced financial loss as a result of this issue, please contact us. We will refund/waive any unarranged overdraft charges or manual payment fees incurred for Monday 4th and Tuesday 5th January 2016 and will review all other claims on a case-by-case basis.

If you have a relationship manager, please contact them. Otherwise, please contact us via our online form or email the Customer Relations team on commercial.customer.relations@hsbc.com.

Once again, I am sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused and thank you for your patience.

John Hackett 
Chief Operating Officer, Europe (HSBC Bank plc)
