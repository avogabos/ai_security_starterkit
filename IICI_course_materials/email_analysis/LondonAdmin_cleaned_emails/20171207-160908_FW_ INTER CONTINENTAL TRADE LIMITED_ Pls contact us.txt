Hello Sara & Shawn,

 

I just got off the phone with Rebecca at Companies House who has informed me that all the documents have been received and that they have been accepted and that all that is outstanding is the payment from you.

 

Rebecca told me that you had sent a cheque already which bounced and that you have been informed that you need to make the payment via card over the phone and then the process will be complete.

 

Please call Companies House now immediately and make this payment as requested today. If this is done today, then the company gets restored today. This should of course have been done a long time ago but it is what it is, This needs to happen now, there is no time to waste here. As you are aware this is most urgent and this is life or death for me. I have been your customer for 10 years just short of 4 months now, please action this immediately and send me your confirmation nonce done today.

 

Bes regards,

Eyvi.
