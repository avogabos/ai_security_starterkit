Dear Nadya,

I discussed this with our Compliance Officer, and have been suggested to pass your request to our Company Secretary department to handle.  I also discussed with Angela, the Director of OLN Corporate Services Limited.  She will assist you to file the said Annual Return and will contact you directly, I copy this email to her.

I received the original ARs, I will pass them to Angela for her further handling.

Regards,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

We require your services in paper filling the Annual Returns for WORLDWIDE VENTURES LIMITED as we do not have the authentication code for this company.

The return that we submitted by post (year 2014-2015) has been rejected by HK registry, we assumed that we would have been billed for it afterwards. In any case we are unable to make this payment as the Registry have stated the following:

For overseas payers, a bank draft in Hong Kong Dollars made payable to "Companies Registry" and drawn on a licensed bank in Hong Kong is required.

We currently cannot acquire this at the moment and this is a matter of urgency.

We need to pay $3,480HKD for the 2014 Annual Return and $870HKD for the 2015 Annual Return.

Please would you be able to kindly file this for us and make the payment on our behalf this time?

I am sending you the correct signed original documents out today, I hope you will receive by Monday/Tuesday if you could you kindly send us an invoice with the additional fees we will make the payment straight away.

Please note I will be out of the office on Monday and back on Tuesday.

Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards
Nadya
