Nadya,

Quite well! Good to hear from you.

So far so good, although my Account Managers will be doing a little more due diligence on the actual transactions for the client.

Please start the process by:

1. Confirming that our wiring instructions (https://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_MT103.pdf) are suitable for you, as our USD route is unique: https://europacbank.com/support/usd-important-wiring-notice/
2. Register here: https://secure.europacbank.com/register.php
3. Please write “Formations House” in the “How did you hear about us?” section of the registration form.
4. Account Management staff will contact you, who are in charge of pre-approving your application. All application-related questions should be directed here.
5. Your dedicated Private Banker will also reach out to you to introduce himself/herself. General product and investment-related questions should be directed here.

p.s. I can’t remember if I introduced you to Ashe Whitener, our new Head of Business Development yet. He is CCed and he will be a great resource to you.

Regards,

Hi Vincent,

How are you?

We have a customer with a company registered in the Marshall Islands.
The director will give power of attorney to a UK resident.
The company works in sales and marketing of binary options, it does not directly trade with binary options.
Many thanks
Nadya
