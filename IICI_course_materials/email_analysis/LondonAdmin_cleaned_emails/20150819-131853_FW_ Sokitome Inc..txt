Dear felix

 

Clearly, then we do not require the company. Sadly, we have now transferred some assets into it, and this will result in considerable expense.

 

I think it best that you advise your insurers of the existence of a substantial claim for damages against you, they will doubtless wish to conduct their own defence of the claim, and ask them please to contact us so that we can instruct our attorneys.

 

Kind regards

 

Paul Lowin

We will issue you a refund as we are unable to open a bank account for you with Reitumu. Kindly send us your details so we can refund the amount.

Dear Felix

 

I have still had no reply to my recent emails. As I stated in my last email, we were told that the process would take 10 days, it has now been more than 6 weeks. The board resolution was returned signed to you more than 10 days ago.

 

In making the decision to form the company, and put certain contracts and assets in its name, we relied upon your representations.

 

We are now in the position of being unable to collect on certain sums owing, and therefore make certain payments owing, which together will result in a potential 7 figure loss.

 

I’m sure that you can see the direction I’m going here. I need a response from you regarding the account tomorrow please.

 

Regards

 

Paul Lowin
