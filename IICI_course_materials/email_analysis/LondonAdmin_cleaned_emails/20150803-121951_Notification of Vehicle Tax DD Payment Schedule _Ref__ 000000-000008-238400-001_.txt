Thank you for arranging to pay the vehicle tax by Direct Debit.
Please can you check that the details below, and your payment schedule are correct:

Bank sort code: 20-71-74
If any of the above financial details are incorrect please contact your bank as soon as possible.
However, if your details are correct you donâ€™t need to do anything and your Direct Debit will be
processed as normal. You have the right to cancel your Direct Debit at any time. If you cancel your
Direct Debit the vehicle will not be taxed. A copy of the Direct Debit Guarantee is included with
this letter.
Enclosed is a schedule of your Direct Debit payments showing the amounts and dates for
collection. We recommend that you retain this schedule for your records.
You do not need to wait for the first payment to be taken before the vehicle is used on the road.
For your information, the collections will be made using this reference, and this is how your
payments will be detailed on your bank statements:
DVLA  Identifier : 295402

Your vehicle tax will automatically renew unless you notify us of any changes. We will send a new
payment schedule at the time of renewal.
Yours  sincerely
