Dear Felix,
That is very unusual, that now you ask for some additional documents?
We have send out all requested documentation with DHL yesterday, which we got from our client on Monday.
What shall we do now? I need to consult with him.
In case he refuse, can you send back all documentation and our advance payment??
I'm also agent for Loyal Bank from SVG, and they haven't ask for such things till now.
Waiting for your reply.
Kind regards, Mitja
