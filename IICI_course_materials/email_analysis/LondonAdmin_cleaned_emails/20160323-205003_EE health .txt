Hi Nadya, 


Thanks so much, E. E Health. 

Address 

Flat 7, 
60 Sancroft Street 
London 
SE11 5NG 

This will be for Paediatric Nursing, Health Visiting , Fitness Blog (advertising) and Fitness/Health Events. 

I will be continuing my employed status with the NHS until at least August. 

But ideally I would for the moment I would like to have my limited company running along side being employed.

From speaking to friends this can make things more complex, so I would probably want a accountant to do my entire financial side of things. I know your company can deal with parts of it, but if they can recommend someone to do the whole thing I would be keen to know more. 

Thanks in advance, 

Have a great  Easter. 










Healthy Regards,

Emily Pocock
