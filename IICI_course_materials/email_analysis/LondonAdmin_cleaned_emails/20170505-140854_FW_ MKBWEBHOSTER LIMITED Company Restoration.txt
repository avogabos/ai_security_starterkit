Dear Sarah,

 

Please send me a written statement today regarding the current status, and the officer's name at CH who is handling the process of restoration.

We cannot delay this any longer here in The Netherlands, therefore we need to present data to the authorities this afternoon proving that the restoration is in the final stage.

Thank you for your swift response.

 

Best regards,

Dear Customer,

Further to our previous correspondence, please advise your client that as per Companies House policy late filing penalties must be paid before the company can be restored.

Please find below Companies House correspondence for your reference. As informed in the email, late filing penalties are hardly ever waived off. However, your client can contact and appeal against the penalty after the company is restored.

Dear Madam

Re – MKBWEBHOSTER LIMITED - 8173424 

When a company applies to be administratively restored, it is a condition of the restoration that late filing penalties must be paid before the company can be restored.  Once the company is restored, it is then
 open to the company to write and appeal against the penalty.   If the appeal is successful, the penalty amount will be refunded.  

Please be aware that the Registrar's discretion over the collection of penalties is extremely limited. Please see our website
www.companieshouse.gov.uk for further information on the appeals process.  Click FAQs on the left hand side and then select Late Filing Penalties. 

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.
Restoration Department.

Dear Sarah,
Please send
me a written statement today regarding the current status, and the officer's name

We cannot
delay this any longer here in The Netherlands, therefore we need to present

final stage.
Thank you

Dear
Customer,
Further to our previous correspondence, please advise your client that as per
Companies House policy late filing penalties must be paid before the company
can be restored.
Please find below Companies House correspondence for your reference. As informed
in the email, late filing penalties are hardly ever waived off. However, your
client can contact and appeal against the penalty after the company is
restored.

Sarah

RE: Your Communication with Companies House, Ref: NUM161169X
Dear
Madam
Re – MKBWEBHOSTER LIMITED - 8173424
When a company applies to be administratively restored, it is a condition of
the restoration that late filing penalties must be paid before the company can
be restored.  Once the company is restored, it is then
open to the company to write and appeal against the penalty.  
If the appeal is successful, the penalty amount will be refunded.
Please be aware that the Registrar's discretion over the collection of
penalties is extremely limited. Please see our website
www.companieshouse.gov.uk
for further information on the appeals process.  Click FAQs on the left
hand side and then select Late Filing Penalties.
Yours faithfully
Mr A. Owen.
Restoration Department.
