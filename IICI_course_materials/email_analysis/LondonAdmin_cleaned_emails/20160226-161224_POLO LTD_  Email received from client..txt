Hello Nadya,

 

Please check below reply received from the client with attached RBS Form.

 

Thank you

 

 

Hello,

 

I have talked to RBS,they accepted the forms as attached, once you provide
me with the originals I'll sign and submit them together with identification
and address verification documents, then the transfer will be completed.

 

Please send the originals to;

 

Contact name: Semir Kimyonok

House number: Mandalya Apt No:5/4

Street: Didim Altinkum Mh. Yali Cd. 74 Sk.

Town: Aydin, 09270

Country: Turkey

Ph: +905059161616

 

 

Regarding the cheque, there is no much details, my bank says just a short
message fromRBS mentions since their records show as stolen they cannot
process the cheque and sending back now. Anyway, it was to liquidate
theaccount before closing, but now we will continue with them, therefore no
need to cash the cheque already, I will talk to the bank later on this and
remove the misunderstanding.

 

 

Thank you.

Hi Shawn,

 

Ms. Pawar is in contact with the bank and she confirmed to them that we
received the forms. 

 

I will send out the original forms asap 

 

However it is not clear to me, I need to know the following for address:

 

Contact name:

House number:

Regarding the cheque there must be some misunderstanding as we still have
the cheque book! 

 

Many thanks!

Hello Nadya,

 

Please check the below reply received from the client.

 

 

Hello,

 

Thank you for the form.

 

I will add my details into the form and send toRBS in order to get their
confirmation and to check what other documents are needed from my side (such
as identity, residence ...etc). Then with the final documents I'll visit the
branch ASAP and will keep you informed. In the meantime, due to security
reasons the bank may contact Ms. Pawar again about this form since she is
the current signatory. Please inform her accordingly on this, because
whenever I talk to RBS, they say "but we have not received any such
information or instruction or confirmation from Ms. Pawar, therefore we
cannot proceed, we cannot provide any further details...etc".

 

By the way, for your information, today ISBANK (my bank in Turkey, whom was
processing the cheque written against my name) informed me that RBS refused
the cheque since it is recorded as "stolen"!

 

Thank you,

Semir Kimyonok

Hello Nadya,

 

Please check the below reply received from the client.

 

 

Hello,

 

Thank you for your response. Actually I had several times requested you to
open a USD account since all our deals are based on USD with the customers,
and you had said it is under process, but seems like it has/could not be
opened due to some reasons. Anyway nothing to do after this moment.

 

About the forms, provide me with the scan copies first please to check with
the person that I'm in contact from RBS (Ms. Mirza, Business Banking
Support) if the forms are OK or if they need anything else. Then you can
send them to the following address. And I'll be in London by early or around
mid March already so I can handle the rest.

Hi Shawn,

 

There is no dollar account opened for this company. 

 

We are sending the forms out to him today. Please confirm to which address
we can send them to for him to sign? He can then take them into the branch
with his ID so that he can be added as a signatory.

Hello Nadya,

 

Please check below email received from the client and kindly advice. Thank
you

 

 

Hello,

 

 

Based on the below correspondence, RBS has just informed me that they have
not received any instructions from Ms. Pawar with regards to changing
signatory authority, and they are currently waiting for this to proceed.

 

 

Please check and inform me with the situation, and if there is anything
needed from my side, advise please.

 

 

Also, there is an expected incoming payment around USD 25,000, due Feb 2016.
I need USD account details please to take this transfer, as I have not been
provided earlier.

 

 

Thank you,
