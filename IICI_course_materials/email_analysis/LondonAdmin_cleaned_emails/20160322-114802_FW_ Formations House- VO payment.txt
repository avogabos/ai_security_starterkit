Dear Charlotte, 

 

this is a final reminder about the VO payment, since we will have year ended audit, 

the last date of payment is 31.3.2016. If we still can't confirmed your payment, 

will suspend all Virtual office services and return all of the mails of Formationa House.

For such a long time we can't get payment from you, I really have great pressure from our 

Account Department, I hope you can understand. 




 

Best regards,
