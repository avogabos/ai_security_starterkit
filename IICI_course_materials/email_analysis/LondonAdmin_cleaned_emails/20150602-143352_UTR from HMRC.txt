Hi Nadya & Tariq,

 

We are expecting to receive a letter from HMRC for REED PACIFIC MEDIA
LIMITED. I am just letting you know in case you come across this letter.
They sent this earlier as well, however it was not received at our end
probably. We have requested to resend the letter.

 

Best Regards,

 

Aisha.
