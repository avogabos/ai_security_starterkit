Dear Nadya,

Sorry for my late reply as I took a week leave and just resume office.

I searched the company registry this morning, but the attached NR1 still not uploaded for download.  I captured the documents list for your easy reference.

In that case, either I wait until it available to download, or you send the original NR1 to me to notarize true copy and apostille.

Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

Happy New Year to you! I hope you are well?

We have just sent the following attached form to the Companies Registry by recorded mail. It should be there within a few days.

Would you be able to prepare an apostille with the changes to the registered address and send it to us by courier ASAP? Please send us an invoice so that we can pay.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
