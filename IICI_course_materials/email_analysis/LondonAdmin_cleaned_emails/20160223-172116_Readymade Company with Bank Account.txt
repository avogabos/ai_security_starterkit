Hi

 

We are adding 2 gold managed companies we have taken back, as customer has
refused to renew

Interweb

 

We want to sell them as readymade company with bank account

 

Charlotte has asked me to check with you if the bank accounts for these 2
companies are good

 

So we can start offering them to cus

 

Also let me know which bank they have bank accounts
