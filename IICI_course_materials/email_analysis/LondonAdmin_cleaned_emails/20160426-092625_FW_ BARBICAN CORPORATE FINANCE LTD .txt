I will be coming into the office on Friday at 2 pm so you could hand me the
old cheque back to me then if you have not already sent it.

 

Regarding my new cheque (which you received yesterday) please bank it
quickly as I am in the process of switching banks.

 

Best Regards

 

Philip

Dear Philip,

 

Thank you for your letter dated 15 April 2016. 

 

Unfortunately we are now not accepting cheques in the name of ACCOUNTS
CENTRE CY. 

 

Please make the cheque payable to AC ONLINE LTD, our automated reminder
emails do also specify this.

 

I have sent the original cheque back to your home address. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
