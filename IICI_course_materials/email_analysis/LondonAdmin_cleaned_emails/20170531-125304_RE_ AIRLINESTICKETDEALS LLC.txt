Hey Sarah, 

 

Yes I do have it! However when we opened the letter with a letter opener it
has sliced the certificate at the bottom, as they folded  the letter in a
certain way that it caught it. 

 

I don't know if you could get another one from the Delaware registry?
Explain to them that it has been cut when opened and could they be so kind
to send us another one?

 

I have a scanned copy here you can send to the customer in the time being?

 

Do you think the customer will want the original?
