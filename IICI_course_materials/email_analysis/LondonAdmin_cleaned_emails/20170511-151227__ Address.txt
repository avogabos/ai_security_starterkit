Hi Nadya

 

You may recall I came in the other day to request the services of an
address. I have an address  at the moment across the road to you but they
have sold the building for Medical use exclusively.

 

Post can sometimes arrive for my family Trusts but will always have the name
"TRUP" in the addressee.

 

Please let me know how I can set this up with you.

 

Thanks

 

Kind Regards

 

Anthony
