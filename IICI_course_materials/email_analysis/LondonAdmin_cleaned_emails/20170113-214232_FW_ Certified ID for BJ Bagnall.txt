Hi Billy, 

 

Thanks for the ID.

 

Please see attached invoice for:

-          2000 GBP for renewal for 2 years plus govt filing penalties

-          900 for 

Apostille Set of company documents: Incorporation certificate, Memo &Arts,
Share certificates, Register of directors, Register of members, Register of
charges- Apostille certificate of good standing- Apostille certificate of
Incumbency. 

 

We have now emailed Seychelles and requested to start the process. I believe
it should take a few days to get a scanned copy however getting the
originals will take a little longer, they say 7-10 working days usually.

 

Kind regards

Nadya

Do you have an update on fees and timelines?
