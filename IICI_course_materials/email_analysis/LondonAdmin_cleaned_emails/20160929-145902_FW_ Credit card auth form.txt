Nadya/Charlotte,

 

Can you please charge the card for £75 as the customer required dormant express accounting for £150 but instead paid for dormant accounting for £75.We need to charge him another 75 and replace the order. As soon as its charged do let me know so I can place the order and inform the accounts department to start the process.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.
