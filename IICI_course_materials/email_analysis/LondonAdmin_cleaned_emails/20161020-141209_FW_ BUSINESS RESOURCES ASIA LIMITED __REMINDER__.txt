Dear Sarah,

 

The immigration inspector at the airport in UK will attach the stamp (visa) on the passport as our client enter into UK so we suppose it will be fine with it. Is it possible for you to confirm it with the bank?

 

We will tell you the date for the meeting tomorrow.

 

 

We look forward to your reply.

 

Best Regards,




Asami Yamada
