Dear Marc,
1.
This is OK – please send.
2.
I can certainly give this to them as an extra but strictly they may not accept as you would have to the original and you would have to present it yourself when it comes to photo ID – please send anyway.
3.
It is not clear what is City House Brakel is?
Do you have a recent statement showing your address from BNP Fortis Bank? You can always black out your transactions and balance on the statement if want privacy.
Kind regards
Nadya
