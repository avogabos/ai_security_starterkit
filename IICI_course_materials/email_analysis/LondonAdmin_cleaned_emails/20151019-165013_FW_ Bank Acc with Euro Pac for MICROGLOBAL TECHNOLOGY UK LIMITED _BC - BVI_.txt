Hi Nadya

 

Attach is the Apostille set of company documents for bank account processing.

 

The original will be posted today, tracking number: Fed Ex AWB No. 7815 3588 390

 

Do bank need originals for bank account or scan copies only?

There are 2 signatories on the account, therefore they must also provide the certified passport and bank statements
