Hi Nadya!

Order 193581


We have received a total payment of 783 from this customer. Bank Charges
were deducted.

 

We normally charge 5% of the payment as our fee. 

I have asked customer to make the remaining payment of GBP 17. which he will
make b next week.  We have GBP 33 from him. Can u check with Charlotte if we
can make this payment now as his penalties might increase if we will delay.

Pls advice.

 

Thanks
