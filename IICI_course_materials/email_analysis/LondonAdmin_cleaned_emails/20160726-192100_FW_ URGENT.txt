Hi Nadya,

 

GROWN KID LTD

Company No. 08096636

Date of Incorporation: 07/06/2012

 

This company was transferred into our system on 2014-03-27 and since then we
have received only one letter (probably today). 

 

Attached is the letter for your reference.

 

Previously the company was registered on different addresses. So client
should look for letters at previous addresses as well.

 

Thank you
