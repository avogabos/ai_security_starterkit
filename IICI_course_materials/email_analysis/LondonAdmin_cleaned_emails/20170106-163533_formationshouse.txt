Dear Mr./Ms.,
We are a service agency for registering domain names. Today, our center received an application from PLUSJ Technology Limited. They apply to register formationshouse as their brand name and some top-level domain names. We found the main body of domain names is same as your used name. We are not sure about the relationship between you and this company.
Now, we are processing this application. We need to confirm whether this company is authorized by your company. Please let me know as soon as possible in order that we can deal with this problem timely. We await your prompt reply.
Best Regards
Johnny Lau
