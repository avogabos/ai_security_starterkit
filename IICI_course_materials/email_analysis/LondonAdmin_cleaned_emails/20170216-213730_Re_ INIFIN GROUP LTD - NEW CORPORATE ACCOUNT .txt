Hello Nadya


I have reviewed the preapproval form and unfortunately I don't think we will be able to proceed based on the following:


1.  Government related business activities are not accepted.

2.  Cameroon is also a restricted country that we cannot deal with.


Regards,

Dear Wade,

I hope you are well.

I have registered on your online system a few hours ago for INFINI GROUP LTD.

Please also see attached pre-approval form, corporate contract and Certified ID documents for the Director.
I have also attached the Company documents which have been directly downloaded from the Companies House website. Would you still require them to be notarised?

I look forward to hearing from you.

I will be back in the office on Monday.

Kind regards
