Hi,

 

Ok great thanks! Yes we can offer the online admin for free here so I guess
I'll wait for the Montago docs to come through also.

 

Thank you

Hi 

 

I have updated our records for ALTHEA INVESTMENTS, in order to update
registry, you will have to ask client to sign the above forms for ALTHEA
INVESTMENTS.

 

Regarding MONTAGO, client does not have online co admin, please check with
cp if I should active the online co admin and do the changes

 

Let me know
