Dear Felix

I have just checked the documents of Omega Flax on the Companies House Register. I have noticed that there is a service address (private one) of the company's director indicated on the Individual Person with Significant Control details page.

 If you remember, during our phone conversation of last week you kindly confirmed to me that the private address of Mr. Koshbakov (the director and shareholder of the company) will be specified nowhere in the company's documents. You confirmed to me that you needed just a full name of the person with the significant control. Actually, we paid 300 Pounds (which is quite significant sum of money for us) in order to secure the personal address of our director and shareholder. However, it looks like the inccurred expenses appeared to be just waste of money, because Formations House specified the private address of Mr. Koshbakov in the Individual Person with Significant Control details page! Moreover, I have just checked your website again and found out that there is no option or service to choose the protection of the private address of PSC. So, if director-shareholder-PSC is one and the same person, than it is just useless to order Director Privacy and Shareholder Protection Service. 

Honestly speaking, we are more than disappointed with this situation. Our director does not prefer his address to be publicly available because he would like to protect his family and children for possible intervention. For this reason, I repeat, we paid 300 Pounds. 

Formations House has been recommended to us by our partners as professional and trustworthy registered agent. We did hope that the company's formation process will be smooth and fast. We did not expect such outcome.  

 

In view of the above, we ask Formations House to remedy the situation and remove the service address of the PSC from the public records. 

Your early reply will be highly appreciated!

Regards,

Victoria.

Dear Felix,

Thank you very much for the comprehensive information provided.

I have one more issue to clarify with you: in the UK Ltd company, which I am planning to register shortly with Formations House, the director and the shareholder will be one and the same person, who would like to keep his personal data (like residential address) confidential. As far as I understand, Formations House provides such service, which is Director Privacy Service and Shareholder Protection Service.

Since in our case the director and the shareholder of the projected company is one and the same person, can we expect that for the fee of 150 Pounds the service address of the director/shareholder (one person) will be substituted with the address of Formations House (London, Harley Street) in every entry, where this service address shall be specified in the Corporate Documents of the company?

We will be very thankful if such option is possible.

Best regards,
Victoria Chirillov
