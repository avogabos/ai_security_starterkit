Hi Nadya,


Great to hear from you, I just tried ringing to discuss your email.


Zambia is on our list of approved countries, however, our bank card supplier does not ship to Zambia. Do you know if that would be an issue for this particular client?


In case I haven't shared with you, our compliance department recently published these two lists:


Prohibited Countries
https://europacbank.com/support/prohibited-countries-list/

Restricted Activities
https://europacbank.com/support/restricted-business-activities/

I have a few updates to share whenever you're free for a quick chat. When would be a good time to connect? I'm just heading out of the office now and will return in ~ 2 hours.

And let me introduce you to baby girl #1...Madeleine...born August 9th :)

Hi Matthew,

Just wondering if there are any issues on with nationals and residents from Zambia?

It will be either a BVI or Belize Limited company.

It doesn't seem to show on the EBP restricted list that I have, but I thought I would just double check. Many thanks!

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
Nadya
