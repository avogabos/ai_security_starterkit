Dear Mr. Hartwig, 

 

Please would it be possible to visit you in your office tomorrow in St. James’s square at all? We now have several company documents which need to be notarised as a matter of urgency. 

 

Please email me on either londonadmin@formationshouse.com <mailto:londonadmin@formationshouse.com>  or this one, or you can call me on 07541219533.

 

I look forward to hearing from you. 

 

Kind regards

Dear Mr. Hartwig ,

 

Thank you for your email. We now have another document which needs notarising so it is possible, once the other 2 are ready to collect we can drop the next one off? 

 

Is there any news with Mr. Kuhn? I hope that all is well?

 

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. 

 

Kind regards

It looks as if not.   I was in before Christmas and during the days before New Year, and the documents are usually brought up to the office if not handed to us in reception, but apart from my covering Manfred the St James’s reception  was working with staff borrowed for the holiday period  which meant that liaison was imperfect.  I’ll check when i am in tomorrow and speak to you.
