Dear Sir/Madam

 

Thank you for your message.

 

My email issues have not been resolved. I still cannot login! 

 

I am correctly using my original userid and password.  I AM NOT USING THE WRONG PASSWORD! 

 

I have tried using the “Forgot password tab on the My Account Screen (i.e. ” If you have forgotten your userid and password, we can send it to your email address”) but nothing happens. Instead, I receive a message from the system informing me that my email address is invalid! This is obviously nonsense as we are currently communicating with each other using this email address! 

 

Please resolve these above issues for me ASAP.

 

Please confirm.

 

Regards

 

Philip Kaye
