Please find attached an example section of The Smart Tech Company 'Executive Summary'.

This clearly defines the purpose and structure of the company.

The banking facilities sole purpose is for the general running of the business.

Outgoing payments will be made towards research, preparation and manufacturing of the product, including materials and the electronic components required.

The main countries imminently involved in production will be China and the UK.

Incoming payments initially will be generated from the UK, by means of our online website, and mainstream retail outlets.

I hope this information clearly defines my original comments on the application.

I trust the submitted referencing will be sufficient for a speedy conclusion to the setting up of the facility.

If there are any issues whatsoever, can you please come back to me as soon as possible.
