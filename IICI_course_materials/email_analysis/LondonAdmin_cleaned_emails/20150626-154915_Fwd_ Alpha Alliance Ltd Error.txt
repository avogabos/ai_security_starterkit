Dear Aldo



I sent you an email about this situation last month.



Regtrebally you reserved this company while I away in hongkong, but for
some reason the company did not get reserved.



This company was actually sold on 27th March and is not available for sale.



I’m very sorry about this situation, but you will have to choose another
company from the readymade list.(not exceeding £275.00)



With Best Regards, TAHIR
