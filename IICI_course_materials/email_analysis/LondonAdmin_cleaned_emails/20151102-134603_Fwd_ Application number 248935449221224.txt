Dear Charlotte,
I hope this finds you well?

I am forwarding the below message to follow-up, as the last communication received was back in August, when Nadya confirmed that I had been taken off as NED for House Conversation, the current NED position & that currently there were no more NED's needed by you then, due to a quiet period.

As I have not heard back from Nadya, I thought I would contact you to see I indeed you do have any further positions required at the moment? I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that I am still registered as Director for House Conversation. 

When convenient if you would be so kind as to give me an update, that would be fabulous,

With Many thanks and Kindest Regards

Violet Heale

Unfortunately it looks like there is not much demand for this currently as we hoped. We still haven't managed to sell the last company but  I will change the director position today and it should be updated by the end of the week.

Thank you for all your help in the past.

I have resent this email to you, as I have not heard anything from you for a couple of months, so if you would be so kind as to give me an update I would appreciate it.
I am following up on our previous communication back on June (a while after being appointed to the last position), with regards to appointing me to a new position. But, as yet, I have heard nothing from you for a couple of months.
Was I taken off as NED for the last position? Or am I still listed as such? If you could let me know whether you have any further positions available
& any further opportunities, as per our previous email discussion.
I look forward to hearing from you,
Many thanks and Kindest
