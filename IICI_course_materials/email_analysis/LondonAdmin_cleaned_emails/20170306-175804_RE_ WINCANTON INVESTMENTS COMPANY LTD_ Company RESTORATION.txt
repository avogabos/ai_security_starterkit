Hi Nadya! Pls advise if you will restore the company for this customer
without restoration charges.  this is the email that we received from
Companies House.

 

 

Dear Sir

 

Thank-you for your email regarding 08589638

 

company name : WINCANTON INVESTMENT COMPANY LTD

 

It appears that the company was removed for non-submission of the annual
return.

 

To restore the company by Administrative Restoration, the following paper
documents and fees are required:-

 

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

 

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter which costs £64 can be obtained from the Government
Legal Department Office  (apply online at  <http://www.gov.uk/bonavacantia>
www.gov.uk/bonavacantia Bona Vacantia - GOV.UK  <http://www.gov.uk>
www.gov.uk

 

Bona Vacantia means vacant goods and is the name given to ownerless
property, which by law passes to the Crown. The Treasury Solicitor acts for
the Crown to administer the estates of people who die intestate (without a
Will) and without known kin (entitled

 blood relatives) and collect the assets of dissolved companies and other
various ownerless goods in England and Wales. 

 

3) Annual Return forms for 28/6/16 and £40 filing fee.

 

Having checked our records, there is an outstanding late filing penalty of
£750 on accounts for 2015.

 

Please note that Accounts for the period ending 30/6/16 are due for filing
by 31/3/17.

 

Yours faithfully

 

Mr R. Davies
