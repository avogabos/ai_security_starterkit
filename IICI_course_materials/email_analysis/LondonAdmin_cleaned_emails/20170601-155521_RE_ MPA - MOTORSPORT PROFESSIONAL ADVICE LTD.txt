Dear Nadya,

 

Thanks for your email.

 

Could you please explain me why did you issue invoices for services towards
the company MPA - MOTORSPORT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE LTD, but services have not
been disbursed?

 

Do you have a credit note concerning this services not rendered?

 

I see on the Companies House's website that the accounts have been
submitted, did you submit it as company's agent?

 

Thank you very much.

 

Regards,

Sarah
