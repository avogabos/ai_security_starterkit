Dear Darius,

 

I seem to have lost the business card of your kind colleague and I wanted to thank her for taking time to meet me last week. 

 

It was a pleasure and I hope we can find ways to cooperate in a mutually beneficial way.

 

For you convenience I am attaching our account opening forms, price list and general information. I have also added a short presentation about our services.

 

Finally,  I have also attached a template introducer agreement. This would allow our compliance to accept documents certified by your in-house lawyer. 

 

Looking forward to our future cooperation.

 

Kind regards,

 

Mantas Staliunas, CFA
