Hi nadya,



Thank you for providing me necessary information.

 

I have seen that director Mr. Elliot Buster Burke Perrin address is secured on Companies House.

 

But for VAT Application HMRC would require director’s residential address.

 

So kindly confirm me if I put 25a Queens Parade Close, LONDON, United Kingdom, N11 3DA as director’s residential address in the VAT Application and submit it to HMRC.

 

Await your confirmation.

 

Regards,

 

Shawn
