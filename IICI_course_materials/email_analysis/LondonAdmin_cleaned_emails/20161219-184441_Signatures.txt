Hi Nadya,

As being Nominee Director in HUMAN ONE LTD client has sent attached forms
which require director signatures.



Please check below from client for your reference:

 

 "I have some forms I need the nominee director of Human One Ltd to sign -
how do I go about this?".


So could you kindly check and advise.



Looking forward to hear from you.
