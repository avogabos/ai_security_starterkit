Dear Oliver, 

 

As per our conversation today I need for you to please draft two letters, both the same, on the letter head of either the Gambia Business Enterprise Authority or the iCommerce Registry simply stating that Yusuf's two banks, the Global Trust Investment Ban Ltd and the Global Central Bank Ltd, are compliant with regards to any tax liabilities they may have in The Gambia. Its a ridiculous request because there are no taxes in the enterprise zone but the SWIFT people are requesting it from them anyway.

 

 

The text of the letter could be as followed:

 

To Whom it may concern;

 

This is to certify that the Global Trust Investment Ban Ltd, chartered in The Gambia Business Enterprised Zone is in full compliance with any and all of its tax liabilities in The Gambia.

 

Sincerely

 

(put here name of director or officer) 

(title of person signing)

(telephone number of person signing)

Gambia Business Enterprise Authority or iCommerce Registry

 

If you could please attach some official looking stamp from The Gambia Business Enterprise Zone or the Registry please do so!

 

Kind Regards,

 

Michael
