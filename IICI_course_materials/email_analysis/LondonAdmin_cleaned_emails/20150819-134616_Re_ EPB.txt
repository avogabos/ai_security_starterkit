*Hi Nadya,*

I sent the below email to Charlotte.
It's not a problem about a new Business Bank Account at EPB.

I asked EPB to receive a big sum of "Consultancy Fees" in the EPB Account I
opened in 2013 as Dottori Commercialisti Londra Ltd (Gambia Company) and
it's still working; for this reason, I sent EPB Head Business Manager (Mr
Ashe Whitener) a copy of the "DOA Agreements were signed few days ago.

Dottori Commercialisti Londra Ltd (Gambia Company) is going to receive some
international bank transfers to Its EPB Account, but EPB manager said EPB
doesn't like to do it.

I think it would be better if Charlotte or Sam speaks and understand the
position of EPB to about.

As I wrote to Charlotte, it's a very big problem for me, because I can't
change now the bank details on 2 DOA and the customer bank is sending the
first consultancy fees.

I'm ready to fly to EPB Head Office in SVG (also with Charlotte or Sam) to
explain the contents of the 2 DOA Agreements.

1 DOA Agreement regards a consultancy fee of €800k; the second DOA
Agreement is much bigger and the consultancy commissions will be payed in
11 tranches.

The 2 DOA are lawful and in accordance with law.

If the consultancy commissions won't be transfered to Dottori
Commercialisti Londra Ltd EPB account, we'll lose them; probably, it would
be useful speak with a member of the EPB Board.

Tell me where I can send you a copy of the 2 DOA Agreements?

Thanks,
Stefano

*Hi Charlotte,*

I need your help with EPB, because I have (with other consultants) to get
some important consultancy fees coming from 2 DOA Agreements signed in last
few days.

I sent the 2 DOA Agreements to EPB, but Mr Ashe Withener (Head Business
Consultant) yesterday wrote me this email:

Hi Stefano –



Thank you for the information, but we are not interested in facilitating
such transactions.  We are not comfortable with the type of financial
transaction nor the size.



Best,
