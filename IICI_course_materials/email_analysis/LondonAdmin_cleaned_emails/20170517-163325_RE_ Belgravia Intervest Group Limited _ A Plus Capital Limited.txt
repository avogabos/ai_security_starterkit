Dear Sarah,

 

I am in London on Thursday and Friday.

Therefore I think it will be convenient for me to collect the document in person.

From your website I understand that your office address is at 29 Harley Street 

London W1G 9QR. Please let me know your office hours so that I can visit the said office to collect the documents.

 

Thank you

 

Jose
