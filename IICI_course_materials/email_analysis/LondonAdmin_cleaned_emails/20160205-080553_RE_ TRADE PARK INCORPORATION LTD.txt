Dear Nadya,

We filed NSC1 and enclose the front page with receipt chop for your file record.

We will have our Chinese New Year holidays from next Monday to Wednesday and no available Notary available in our office during this two weeks.  I afraid that I have no choose but need to wait Alfred resume office.  If you have other Notary Public in Hong Kong could help, please let me know so I could pass the original NR1 to him/her.

Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

Thank you for your email. I was not in the office yesterday.

We have now manged to file the NR1 online. I can see that it is now pending. Please kindly file the NSC1 on our behalf.

Would you be able to use another Notary on our behalf and we will pay however much extra is required? We really need those documents ASAP.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regard
Nadya

Dear Nadya,

I received the original NSC1 and NR1 this afternoon.  But Alfred is now on leave and will back to office on 17 February 2016.

I could arrange our colleague to file both forms to company registry tomorrow morning, and do the apostille when Alfred resume office.

Please confirm and I await hearing from you.

Regards,
Nelly

Dear Nadya,

Happy Chinese New Year!

I checked the company registration this morning again and can see no update.

Once we receive the original documents from you, we can produce notarized true copies and apostille.  We can also arrange to file the documents to HK Company Registry.  As before, we will charge HK$3,000.

Please note that this service is only provided for your convenience.  We will not be responsible for the contents of the documents to be registered, and whether the Company Registry will accept the same.

For you information, Alfred will take leave from tomorrow and will resume office on 16 February 2016.

Regards,

Nelly

Dear Nelly,

Happy New Year to you once more!

I am checking the registry daily and there is still no update on the change of registered address and the matter is becoming very urgent.

I can see that the forms were signed for as we sent it recorded delivery on the 18th January 2016 but there is still no update online. Would there be a reason for this?

I am now sending you the originals over to you by courier so that you can prepare the apostille with the new registered address.

Additionally and very importantly we also need to update the share structure for TRADE PARK CORPORATION LTD. Forms are attached and I am sending you the originals to be submitted to the companies and then we will also require an another 2 apostilles with the new updated share structure.

Please could you kindly check if we have filled it out properly to avoid it being rejected? We are happy to be invoiced for this assistance or please could you kindly put me in the right direction as I am not entirely sure how to fill out these forms.

I would also like to know how we can order the authentication code for this company so that we can file everything online to speed up the process.

Our investor's (Faisal Almutari) solicitor may contact you as they would like to verify that we are indeed filing this document to the Hong Kong Companies Registry. They may also require your services in the future.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.

Kind regards
Nadya

Dear Nadya,

Sorry for my late reply as I took a week leave and just resume office.

I searched the company registry this morning, but the attached NR1 still not uploaded for download.  I captured the documents list for your easy reference.

In that case, either I wait until it available to download, or you send the original NR1 to me to notarize true copy and apostille.

Thanks,
Nelly

We have just sent the following attached form to the Companies Registry by recorded mail. It should be there within a few days.
