Hello Nadya,

 

As per Charlotte confirmation please find attached DS01 for BANNOCK
MANAGEMENT LTD.

 

We would need this form signed by the company director.

 

So, kindly advice if I forward this form directly to the company director
for signature.

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

 

Thank you
