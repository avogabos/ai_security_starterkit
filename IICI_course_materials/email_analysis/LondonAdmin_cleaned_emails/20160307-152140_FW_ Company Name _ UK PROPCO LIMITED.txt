Hello Nadya,

 

Company name: UK PROPCO LIMITED

 

The above mentioned was our managed company with Mr. Ayub Khan appointed as
a director.

 

However Mr. Ayub Khan was terminated on 18/03/2015 from the company.

 

Since the new directors are appointed client has emailed us that now he no
longer requires this company.

 

Email was sent to Tahir (Below mentioned):

 

Appointment of MR ADAM TAYLOR and MR JAMES RICHARD MORTIMORE (Current
Director) and termination of Mr. AYUB KHAN are done through Companies House.

 

Also the current status of the company is In Administration (on Companies
House).

 

So could you please check if this company is still in our records?

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

 

Shawn
