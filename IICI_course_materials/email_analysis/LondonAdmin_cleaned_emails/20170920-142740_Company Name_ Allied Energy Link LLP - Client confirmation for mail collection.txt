HiCharlotte,

 

I visited the office ( 22 Harley place) to pick up my mails.

 

My daughter moved to London to continue her education at UCL. I authorise
her to pick up my mails. Please let the office know.

 

Secondly, if I hire part time employee ( payment below thresh hold), do I
need to obtain GST or any numberfrom the tax office? They wouldn't be paying
any tax.
**Accounts Team will reply for this.

 

With best regards,

Mohammad Hoghooghi
