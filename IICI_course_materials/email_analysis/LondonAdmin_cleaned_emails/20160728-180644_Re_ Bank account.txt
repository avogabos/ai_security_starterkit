Dear Marc,
Ok I just spoke with the bank and they have confirmed that I have been taken off the account, so they cannot discuss anything with me now.  Finally!
This is the number to call 0345 307 0900 (Direct Business Banking) and press option 3. You will probably have to hold for a few minutes before you can speak with anyone.
You will have to go through some security questions as you do not have a customer number issued to you yet.
For security they will ask some personal details (date of birth, home address) and ask for the account number and sort code, business address etc.
Sort code: 16 00 83
Account No: 00124799

RE: Bank account
Dear Marc,
I called them yesterday afternoon and they said someone would call me back so I am waiting, I think I will just try them again now.
I tried to use my customer number yesterday for telephone banking at the first stage and it didn’t work so I assume the changes are being made for sure.
I will update you shortly.
Kind regards
Nadya

Dear Nadya,
Already 4 days again and no news either call(s) from RBS.
Do you think I can take contact with them today?
We need urgently the bank carta do go ahead .
