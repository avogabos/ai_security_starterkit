Hi Nadya,

 

Remember we applied for dissolution for this company and we made payment to
Angela from CS.

 

She's saying we should receive a letter from HK "notice of no objection" and
i check and confirmed with Diva (from Nova), she said there is no mail
received.

 

Angela is saying we will have to request and write a letter to the IRD for
obtaining a fresh "notice of no objection" and arrange to file the same with
the relevant form to the Companies Registry.

 

Please advise can we do this from our HK efile point email address ? and ask
them to issue it because angela is charging alot.

Companies Registry "CR".

 

Attached please find for your attention again my email of 25th August, 2016.
Please note that we have the documents of the Company to the CR on 24th
August, 2016.  However, as advised by the officer of the CR, the relevant
documents have been rejected and returned to your Hong Kong office since the
"notice of no objection" was issued over 3 months to the CR. 

 

In this regard, please arrange to write to the Inland Revenue Department
("IRD") and request IRD to issue a fresh "notice of no objection".
Moreover, please let us have the fresh "notice of no objection" and a new
set of signed form NDR1 again so that we can arrange for the filing to the

Alternative, we are pleased to assist and write a letter to the IRD for

Hi Nadya,
Remember we applied for dissolution for this company and we made
payment to Angela from CS.
She’s saying we should receive a letter from HK
“notice
of no objection” and i check and confirmed with Diva (from Nova), she said
there is no mail received.
Angela is saying we will have to request and write a letter to the
IRD for obtaining a fresh “notice of no objection” and arrange to
file the same with the relevant form to the Companies Registry.
Please advise can we do this from our HK efile point email address
? and ask them to issue it because angela is charging alot.
