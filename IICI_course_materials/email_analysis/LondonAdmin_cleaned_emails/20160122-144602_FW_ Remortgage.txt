Subject: RE: Remortgage

Dear Charlotte,

Thank you for your email.

The executed Legal Charge has been sent to QCAS and I await an undertaking from them that they will send to us £70,000.00 upon receipt of the remortgage monies at which time I will release the papers I have sent to them which they are holding to my order.

I also await an undertaking from QCAS that they will register the Legal Charge for the remaining monies owed with the new mortgagee upon completion.

Kind regards,

Emma Faulkner

Subject: RE: Remortgage

Dear Emma,

QCAS have informed me they wrote to you on Wednesday to request a document relating to the Legal Charge which has been accepted by Nationwide.
Currently I am mid way through the grace period given by Nationwide to complete.

Please can you confirm when you have responded and supplied the request to QCAS, as if it can be done with haste I could still complete before the 21st and therefore not need to reapply for a new mortgage offer.

Kind Regards
Charlotte Pawar

Dear Charlotte,

The documents were sent to QCAS on the 17th December 2015 and I have heard nothing back save for an email dated the 23rd December 2015 confirming that they have referred the Legal Charge to Nationwide for confirmation of instructions that they are happy to proceed.

Have you heard any further from QCAS?

Kind regards,

Emma
