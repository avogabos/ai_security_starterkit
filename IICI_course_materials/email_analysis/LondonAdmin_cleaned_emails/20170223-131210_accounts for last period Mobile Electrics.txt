Hi,

 

The director at the time processed the costs that you know from the VAT etc,
and whatever was remaining he took as director income, I don't know whether
we need to show that or how but he is peronaly liable for the income tax on
that, 

 

He invoiced between march and june 2016 a total of 4287.56

3377.56 was invoice to a contractor who retained CIS on it and paid him a
total of 2690.80

 

Means 686.76 has already been collected for HMRC by the contractor for tax

Please then minus any vat costs, add back in the vat reclaimed amount, and
then whatever is left please show as payment to director as salary. So the
company did not make a profit

 

If there is a place to include the directors income and national insurance
please do, as ideally I want hmrc to know he hasn't paid the income tax on
that as he didn't file his self assessment even though he was advised to

 

Please let me know if this doesn't make sense, and then prep the accounts
for m approval

 

To recap on why we do this no cost, this company is now one available for
sale as a RM with bank account and VAT

 

Thanks

 

 

 

Kind Regards,
