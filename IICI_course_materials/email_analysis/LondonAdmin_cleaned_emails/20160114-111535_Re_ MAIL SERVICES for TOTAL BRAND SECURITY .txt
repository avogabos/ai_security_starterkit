Great would be if you give me your phone direct number and I can dictate my credit card details and pay immediately if you want. But please don't delay the extreme accounting.
There is still something else that needs to be sent to Kings lynn. Tarik has it.  it is a simple looking label but is of high importance to be sent.
Many thanks for confirming you have sent this also.
Best regards,
