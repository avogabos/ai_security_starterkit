Hi

 

There is no debit card but we still have a paying in book and cheque book
here. However now that there has been a change of ownership it maybe that
they would need to order a new cheque book possibly? (not entirely sure)

 

The account has online banking. We would advise to reset everything.

Hello,

 

Please be informed that the forms have been submitted at RBS and the
necessary changes have been made. Now I am the authorised signatory of the
account. You may find the attached new statement of account with updated
name and address information.

 

Now, could you please inform me if the Cheque Book and Debit Card (if there
is) are still in your possession or have been returned back to RBS? Because
I will need them to make some payments to the London Chamber.

 

Also, as far as I remember, this account has been registered to RBS Bankline
services. So, the Customer ID, User ID, and the passwords should be reset as
well.

 

Thank you,

 

Semir Kimyonok
