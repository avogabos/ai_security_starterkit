Dear Nelly,



Re: Heythorp Healthcare China Ltd



I wondered do you have a the formally stamped share transfer document confirming the transfer back to Albion Outlook Ltd the 1 share Worldwide Ventures Ltd had in our Hong Kong company to set it up?



I look forward to hearing from you.



Kind regards

Nadya
