Hi Nadya,

Thanks for the confirmation. I also made a request for £260 to be paid on 9th July. Was that also paid?

Thanks,
Jason

</div>Hi Jason,

The payment was made on the 24th July 2015 we have checked and the payment hasn't bounced back so therefore she would need to check it at her end.

Kind regards

Nadya

Dear Nadya,

According to the payee, the funds haven't been received.

The payee has told me that the account is in her personal name, Julie Goodwin, so that may be why?

Could you please process the payment today?

Many thanks,
Jason
