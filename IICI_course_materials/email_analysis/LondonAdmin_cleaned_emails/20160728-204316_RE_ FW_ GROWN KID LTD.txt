Hi Nadya,

 

Thank you for your email. 

With all the unpleasantness we had, James & I are not really enthusiastic about paying for a new year again specially without having any answer before.

I rather expect from you an offer for one year free renewal services for the prejudice.

 

To remind you we paid for one year virtual office services and never get ANY mail.

Then, we paid for 2 years registered address without getting any scan (governmental letters) which is a very serious matter (fortunately we have almost everything online for HMRC or companies house) but it's still a big failure from your service.

 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Best,

 

Cécilia

Hi,

 

I have also checked with the mail room and there are a few pieces of mail here non-government and one government. 

 

Please kindly renew the virtual office service and registered address and we will then be able to release your post. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
