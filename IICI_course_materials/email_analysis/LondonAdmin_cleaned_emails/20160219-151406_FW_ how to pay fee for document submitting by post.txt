Dear Mehwish khan, 

Thank you for your email of 18 February 2016. 

You can send in the annual return by post together with the appropriate
payment to "The Companies Registry, 14th floor, Queensway Government
Offices, 66 Queensway, Hong Kong".  For documents submitted by post, the
official receipt will be sent to you by post. 

If the document is delivered by post, the document will not be regarded as
having been delivered to the Registrar if it has not been received by the
Registrar. 

Documents requiring fees must be delivered for registration with the correct
fees. Cheques should be crossed and issued in Hong Kong Dollars payable to
“Companies Registry”. For overseas payers, a bank draft in Hong Kong
Dollars made payable to “Companies Registry” and drawn on a licensed bank
in Hong Kong is required. Please do not send cash. 

An information pamphlet ‘Price Guide To Main Services’ showing the
registration fees of annual returns and ‘
<http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/7-e.pdf> Delivery of Documents to
Companies Registry for Registration’ are also attached for your reference.
