Hi Nadya,

Thank you for your email.
With all the unpleasantness we had, James & I are not really enthusiastic
about paying for a new year again specially without having any answer
before.
I rather expect from you an offer for one year free renewal services for
the prejudice.

To remind you we paid for one year virtual office services and never get
ANY mail.
Then, we paid for 2 years registered address without getting any scan
(governmental letters) which is a very serious matter (fortunately we have
almost everything online for HMRC or companies house) but it's still a big
failure from your service.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Cécilia
