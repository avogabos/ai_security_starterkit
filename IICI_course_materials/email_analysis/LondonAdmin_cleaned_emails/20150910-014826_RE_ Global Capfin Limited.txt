Dear Nadya,
Alfred is now on leave and will back to office tomorrow and sign the Notarial Certificate and then send to High Court.  I expect it will be ready for your client to pick on or after Tuesday afternoon.
Please let me know when your client will attend our office and please ask him to look for me at the reception.
Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nadya,



I confirm receipt of the original NNC3 and Bought and Sold Notes of Global Capfin Limited.



I will proceed to file to Company Registry and IRD.  After filing the same, I will also arrange Alfred to notarize true copies and send to High Court for apostille.  Please confirm if we only need to apostille the NNC3 and Bought and Sold Notes or with all the company documents, includes NNC1, AA, CI and BR?



I await hearing from you.



Regards,
