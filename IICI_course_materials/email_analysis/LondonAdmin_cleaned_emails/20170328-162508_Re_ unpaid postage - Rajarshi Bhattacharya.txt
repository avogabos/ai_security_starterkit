Yes please.
Also please note I had to pay £3 to release a packet posted to me by you guys that was not stamped with the right amount. The £3 also included an admin fee for Royal Mail that could have been avoided. Please can you make sure that the correct amount of postage is paid for my parcels.
Thank you.
