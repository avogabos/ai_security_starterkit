Subject: re POLO LTD: email from the client
From: "Shawn Alfanso" <shawn@formationshouse.com>
To: <londonadmin@formationshouse.com>

Hello Nadya,

 

Please check below email received from the client and kindly advice.

 

Thank you.

 

 

Dear Customer Support,

 

 

Notedabout the requirement of presence.

 

 

Actually I am extremely busy with some businesses, and there is an upcoming
very important conference/fair that I should focus on, but I'll try to spare
some time.

 

 

But in this case I may need an invitation letter from you regarding the
subject, otherwise I may not be able tosign any document, because the
British Embassy in Turkey requires an explanation letter (and supportive
documents) for each and every travel to UK. And once I mention about such
visit to your company, the Embassy may requesta letter from your company to
support this.

 

 

Anyway I don't know much about the details of this procedure/formalities, so
I'll check with my Visa service provider and let you know ASAP.

 

 

Thanks

 

 

Kind Regards,

Semir Kimyonok
