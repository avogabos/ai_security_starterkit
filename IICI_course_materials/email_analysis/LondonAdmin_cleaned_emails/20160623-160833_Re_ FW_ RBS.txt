Dear Marc,
I have spoken with Edric this morning and he is still waiting to receive the ID. If he does not get it by tomorrow then I will go back to RBS and find out what is happening.
Kind regards

Dear Marc,
I hope you had a safe journey home. I have just spoken with Edric and he said that he should get the documents by tomorrow. I will call them again tomorrow to get an update.
Kind regards
