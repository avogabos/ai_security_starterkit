Nadya/Charlotte,

 

Customer signed up for the Seychelles Starter Pack for £795 and paid for
it.We set up the company sent him the company documents and the Euro Pacific
Bank forms, He filled it and send it to us and the bank spoke to him and he
informed them that his business would be mainly getting payments from
African countries however in the form he had mentioned US,UK  is where
payments would be made and his payments would be coming from the Arab
Nations.

 

The bank informed him that they do not accept payments from African
countries which is no use to him than and he would like his money back for
the bank account.

 

Kindly let me know how to proceed as I need to update him by calling him
before lunch time.
