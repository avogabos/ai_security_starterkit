To clarify the transfer documents mean that World Ventures have transferred their shares to Julian?

Hi Wade,

So sorry it now has a witness signature on it. The other one did not!

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Thank you for your email,



If Worldwide Ventures holds shares, we will need the registers and the corresponding KYC for the individuals behind the company.

Hi Wade,

Yes, we are trying to get the share transferred to the director and will provide the share transfer document shortly.

WORLDWIDE VENTURES LTD is actually one of our companies we use to incorporated HK companies as this is mandatory at the point of incorporation. Once the Annual returns are filed we will remove ourselves. What else do you require exactly for WORLDWIDE VENTURES?

Kind regards
Nadya

Hi Nadya



The client has provided most of the documents however there is still a couple of items missing, specifically the reference to the shareholder WORLDWIDE VENTURES, the client has said they have contacted Formationshouse regarding the registers and KYC for WORLDWIDE VENTURES.  Are you aware of this?
