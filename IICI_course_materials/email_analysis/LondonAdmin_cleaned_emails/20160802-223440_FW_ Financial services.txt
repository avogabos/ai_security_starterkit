Dear Charlotte,

Thank you for updated documents.
The ID copy should be sufficient for company incorporation. However, before
we apply for Securities Dealers license, we will also need to obtain this ID
copy notarised.

I haven't received a confirmation from our accountant about the USD 2,000
payment. If this has been paid by you, kindly inform me about the name of
sender and exact date of payment, I will investigate with the accounting
department then.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Anna

Dear Charlotte,

The client could not pass the due diligence with the documents provided. The
problems are:
- his ID has expired in 2015. Kindly provide a copy of valid passport,
notarized.
- the bank statement is also outdated. Kindly provide a utility bill or bank
statement not older than 3 months, showing client's resident address.

Best regards,
Anna

Just updating you

Police certificate is in process and I expect very soon

 

What else do you need to be able to do the first incorporation stage, as I

Also can I have the regulations for the Vanuatu Licence, as I want to offer
this to another client and need to read it first properly

Dear Charlotte,

Please confirm whether Mr Jean Cadet is going to be a shareholder and will
hold a Representative's License as well?
KYC requirements have been updated recently and now each holder of
Representative's license is required to provide a police certificate. Let me
know if Mr Cadet can provide this

Dear Charlotte,

 

The requirement is to have a real office if you wish to be registered as FSP
in New Zealand. Virtual office is not acceptable.

The office needs to be set up when you apply for a license.

 

As an alternative, you may apply for Vanuatu Securities Dealers License,
which does not require office.

Hi Anna

 

Another quick question, for the office in NZ, do they need this immediately
or after the licence, and can this just be Virtual Office? It seems very
expensive to maintain a physical office when they wont be using it often

Dear Charlotte,

 

The renewal fees will be as follows:

USD 550 - one NZ entity renewal. Accordingly, if we have let's say one NZ
LTC as a General Partner and Limited Partnership itself, then these are 2
entities USD 550 x 2 = 1100

USD 1210 - Vanuatu company renewal or USD 2370 for Vanuatu company with
Nominee director service

 

I do not include ongoing costs, such as professional director, officer for
NZ FSP and office rent, as these are paid monthly.

 

There will be also accounting fees, however I cannot tell precise prices as
all depends on the volume and transactions. I have attached our Accounting
brochure for you to have an idea of pricing.

 

I wanted to ask you - where are you located? Would you be interested in
promoting Vanuatu citizenship as our agent?

Dear Charlotte,

 

1.       The names of directors or shareholders of Vanuatu IBC are not
published.

2.       The CIIP was reestablished this March and we do offer this service.
The required investment is USD 260,000 per applicant or per family (spouses
and 1 child under 18). Do you have customers interested in this service?

3.       Annual accounts are not required for IBC.

4.       It is not required to have a Company Secretary for Vanuatu IBC

 

To apply for Vanuatu SDL you will need to submit the following documents:

1.       Business plan

2.       Application form, which will be provided by us

3.       AML (anti-money laundering) Questionnaire, which will be provided
by us

4.       Due diligence documents for each director, shareholder and
beneficial owner of the company:

-          Notarised passport copy

-          Utility bill, certified copy or original (no older than 3 months)

-          Reference from lawyer or accountant or bank reference

-          Personal CV (resume)

If you have AML guidelines and policy, you should submit as well. Otherwise
we will assist with its preparation.

Dear Anna,

 

I have a few questions regarding the Vanuatu structure, it looks like
something we can offer to other clients potentially also.

*       Has the law changed regarding publishing directors' names for
international business companies? What is the current status?

*       Is the Capital Investment Immigration Plan still in effect (where
foreigners pay a relatively small amount for limited Vanuatu citizenship)?

*       Do IBCs need to submit annual filings?

*       Is it still not required to have a Company Secretary?

 

Please can you let me know the information on the above, and also for the
application for the financial licence in Vanuatu what will you require from
us to process

 

Thanks and Kind Regards

Dear Sir,

 

Please find attached our LP-FSP brochure.

 

Briefly about this structure.

We suggest to use the New Zealand Limited Partnership (LP), where General
Partner is a New Zealand company and a Limited Partner (or one of the
Limited Partners) is a company in Vanuatu, having financial license in a
country of incorporation.

 

The registration of FSP takes two separate stages:

STEP 1

-          We register NZ LP, in which General Partner is a company in NZ
and Limited Partner is a company in Vanuatu 

-          Vanuatu obtains SDL (Securities Dealers License) at the country
of incorporation.

At this stage the entity is not registered on the financial service register
in New Zealand, however under NZ law it can already offer services to
international (Non-Zealand) clients without being registered on the
financial service providers registry in NZ

 

Costs and time breakdown:

-          Vanuatu company formation - about 7 days: 2,000

-          Vanuatu license - 2 months

-          Our professional fees: USD 13,000

-          License fee: USD 2,000

-          LP registration with NZ nominee director - 5 days: USD 4,000

 

 

STEP 2

Once the LP-FSP is registered as above, we can then apply for registration
on the New Zealand financial services providers registry

In order to do so, you must have an office in New Zealand and you also must
have staff in NZ to satisfy the authorities that your business is connected
with New Zealand.

 

The cost are as follows:

- Office rental approximately USD 2,000 per month, but depends on location

- Director professional USD 1,500 per month

- Office manager USD 300 per week

- Professional services for registration in FSPR (including preparation of
AML policy, assistance with business plan) USD 10,000

- Disputes resolution registration - USD 2,500

 

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me and
Evgeny.

Dear Sir,
Please find attached our LP-FSP brochure.
Briefly about this structure.
We suggest to use the New Zealand Limited Partnership (LP), where General Partner is a New Zealand company and a Limited Partner (or one of the Limited Partners) is a company in Vanuatu, having financial license in a country of incorporation.
The registration of FSP takes two separate stages:
STEP 1
-
We register NZ LP, in which General Partner is a company in NZ and Limited Partner is a company in Vanuatu
-
Vanuatu obtains SDL (Securities Dealers License) at the country of incorporation.
At this stage the entity is not registered on the financial service register in New Zealand, however under NZ law it can already offer services to international (Non-Zealand) clients without being registered on the financial service providers registry in NZ
Costs and time breakdown:
-
Vanuatu company formation – about 7 days: 2,000
-
Vanuatu license – 2 months
-
Our professional fees: USD 13,000
-
License fee: USD 2,000
-
LP registration with NZ nominee director – 5 days: USD 4,000
STEP 2
Once the LP-FSP is registered as above, we can then apply for registration on the New Zealand financial services providers registry
In order to do so, you must have an office in New Zealand and you also must have staff in NZ to satisfy the authorities that your business is connected with New Zealand.
The cost are as follows:
- Office rental approximately USD 2,000 per month, but depends on location
- Director professional USD 1,500 per month
- Office manager USD 300 per week
- Professional services for registration in FSPR (including preparation of AML policy, assistance with business plan) USD 10,000
- Disputes resolution registration – USD 2,500
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me and Evgeny.
