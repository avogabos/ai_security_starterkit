Dear Sir/Madam,

This is a friendly reminder, as we have not yet received the completed FATCA/CRS self-certification form that was requested for legal entity FIRST HEALTH LTD, for company account FirstHealth. Could you please provide us with the completed form as soon as possible through the link provided below?

If you have any questions or doubt the validity of this request, please contact us on our public phone number +31 20 240 1660, contact your account manager directly or see https://www.adyen.com/contact .

The original e-mail is attached here:

-------------------------------

Given the growth of the Adyen business we have outgrown the regulatory framework provided by our Payment Institution license under the European Commission’s Payment Service Directive (PSD License). We have therefore worked with our regulator, The Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank), to upgrade our PSD License to a Banking License. Our Banking License has been granted by the European Central Bank (ECB) and will be passported across all EU member states.

Besides this having numerous advantages for you as a merchant of Adyen, this also brings along some additional requirements. One of these requirements is the self-certification for FATCA and CRS purposes. This email is regarding the self-certification for the legal entity FIRST HEALTH LTD, that we have registered from company account FirstHealth.

Could you please fill out the self-certification form linked here: https://eu.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=e8112d16-2f2b-49cd-ac00-72f7107124b6 <https://eu.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=e8112d16-2f2b-49cd-ac00-72f7107124b6&accountcode=FirstHealth&legalname=FIRST%20HEALTH%20LTD&country=GB> &accountcode=FirstHealth&legalname=FIRST%20HEALTH%20LTD&country=GB

Please note that if there are multiple entities registered with Adyen, you will receive multiple of these emails. Please fill it out for each of the entities. We would appreciate if you could send us this form within 30 days of receipt.

If you have any questions, or anything appears to be incorrect, please let us know.

Thanks for your assistance!

Kind regards,
