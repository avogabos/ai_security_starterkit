Dear Charlotte 

 

Hi! I am Angela Jen.  A director of OLN Corporate Services Limited.  

 

We are pleased to check and arrange for the filing of relevant corporate
documents to the Companies Registry and Inland Revenue Department. 

 

Service fee will be charged based on the actual time spent.  

 

A solvent Hong Kong company can apply for deregistration for the
dissolution.  We are pleased to assist to check and arrange for the filing
relevant corporate documents to Companies Registry and Inland Revenue
Department at different stages.   We expect that our service fee for one
company is HK$5,000 (US$649) including the disbursements of HK$1,000
(US$129).  

 

Should you have any enquiry, please feel free to contact us.  

 

We wish you have a Happy Chinese New Year and a prosperous year of Monkey!

 

Best regards

Angela Jen

Dear Nelly,

 

Usually Nadya liaises with you on company documents, but I also wish to ask
you some other assistance and perhaps use your services to complete this.

 

We have a customer whose company is less than 1 year old but wishes to
dissolve (strike off) the company. We are aware or some of the process but
would appreciate your assistance with filing the documents.

 

Our issue is that we use an online system for the registration of companies
but after this much of the administration is paper based and requires proper
filing and we need the assistance of your team and services to complete each
time.

 

What I would like is to have a permanent service with you for the filing of
accounts, annual returns and dissolution documents. Where we can e-file we
will, but in other cases we will need you assistance with checking the
paperwork and then filing.

 

Please can you look into the costs to do this for us.

 

Some companies such as TradePark Corporation and Heythorp will require a lot
of filings in the next year and we want these done without delay each time
so we would be keen to pay you to do this for us when possible,

 

In the case of the Dissolution please let me know what you need from us to
proceed.

 

Many Thanks

 

 

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
