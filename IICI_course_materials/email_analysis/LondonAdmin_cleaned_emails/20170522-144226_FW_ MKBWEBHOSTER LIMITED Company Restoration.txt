Dear Sarah,

 

Regarding this file MKBWebhoster Ltd, we contacted Companies House last Friday.

According to them you did not file any documents for restoration of the company, and the fines are also not paid to Companies House.

They have requested us to send in all documents related to this case, so they can investigate.

We will file a full compliant at Companies House  if indeed you did not send in all documents, and if you have the amounts of the fines still in your possession 

 

I cannot imagine that we have discussed this file in the last 7 weeks without you doing anything, so please respond to me as soon as possible with all documents which were filed and a proof that the documents were submitted. Also we want to know what the status is according to your file. We will speak to companies house later today so it would be good to have your documents in our possession.

Thank you for you swift reply.

Dear Customer,

Further to our previous correspondence, please advise your client that as per Companies House policy late filing penalties must be paid before the company can be restored.

Please find below Companies House correspondence for your reference. As informed in the email, late filing penalties are hardly ever waived off. However, your client can contact and appeal against the penalty after the company is restored.

Dear Madam

Re – MKBWEBHOSTER LIMITED - 8173424 

When a company applies to be administratively restored, it is a condition of the restoration that late filing penalties must be paid before the company can be restored.  Once the company is restored, it is then
 open to the company to write and appeal against the penalty.   If the appeal is successful, the penalty amount will be refunded.  

Please be aware that the Registrar's discretion over the collection of penalties is extremely limited. Please see our website
www.companieshouse.gov.uk for further information on the appeals process.  Click FAQs on the left hand side and then select Late Filing Penalties. 

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.

Dear
Customer,
Further to our previous correspondence, please advise your client that as per
Companies House policy late filing penalties must be paid before the company
can be restored.
Please find below Companies House correspondence for your reference. As informed
in the email, late filing penalties are hardly ever waived off. However, your
client can contact and appeal against the penalty after the company is
restored.
Best Regards,
Sarah

Dear
Madam
Re – MKBWEBHOSTER LIMITED - 8173424
When a company applies to be administratively restored, it is a condition of
the restoration that late filing penalties must be paid before the company can
be restored.  Once the company is restored, it is then
open to the company to write and appeal against the penalty.  
If the appeal is successful, the penalty amount will be refunded.
Please be aware that the Registrar's discretion over the collection of
penalties is extremely limited. Please see our website
www.companieshouse.gov.uk
for further information on the appeals process.  Click FAQs on the left
hand side and then select Late Filing Penalties.
Yours faithfully
Mr A. Owen.
Restoration Department.
