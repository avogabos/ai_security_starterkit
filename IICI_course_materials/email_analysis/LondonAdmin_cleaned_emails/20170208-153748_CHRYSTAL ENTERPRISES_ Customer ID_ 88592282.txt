Dear Support
I have received within the last week a very large envelop from you with
three months of customer payment information and correspondence inside.
We were reminded to top up our wallet a little while ago but to have mail
coming from November 2016 seems ridiculous!!
It also causes problems with our customers when we are chasing them for
invoice payments if they are already paid or the cheques are sitting in
HarleyStreet.
Please would you address this situation, thank you

Kind Regards

Philip
