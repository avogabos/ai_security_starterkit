Hi Nadya,


Ah ok, interesting. Do you think there may be opportunity here to reach out to the client regarding bank account assistance or would that be outside of your common practice?

Hi Matt,

This client must have gone directly to you as we don't have a record of him coming to us for bank account assistance.

Thanks!
Nadya

Hi Nadya,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm touching base as our banking staff informed me that the application for Mr. Eugene Coker (Totsworldwide) has been suspended due to the Account Manager being unable to get in touch. Do you know if the client is still interested in pursuing the account?

Thanks in advance, Nadya.
