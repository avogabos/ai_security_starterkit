Dear Rachel  

 

I note that Nelly only assisted for the filing of the documents to the
government department in the past but she did not assist to prepare any
documents. 

 

In this connection, I quoted HK$6,000 for check and assist for the filing of
documents for the application for deregistration to the relevant government
departments together with the filing fee as per my email of 16th February,
2016. 

 

According to your email of 23rd and 26th February, 2016, it seems that you
will not prepare the documents regarding the application for deregistration
of the Company.  

 

We are pleased to assist the Company to prepare the documents.   

 

Please confirm us that we shall prepare the relevant documents for the
application for deregistration.  If yes, we shall revise our invoice to
HK$9,500 (US$1,233).   

 

If not, please arrange to let us have signed documents and we shall arrange
for the filing accordingly.  Thanks.
