Hello Nadya
Please note that previously we made double payments to new heaven, and they
have remaining balance of USD9,328. We can always utilize payment of
invoices from the remaining balance new heaven have for us.

 

Also client has renewed MICROGLOBAL TECHNOLOGY UK LIMITED, and this company
has been renewed by new heaven,

Other companies I have informed their account managers and they will chase
them for payments.

 

Regards

 

Rachel

Formations House
