    Wire Transfers   
 The majority of international transactions are facilitated through the SWIFT network. Here are some tips and tricks to help ensure a successful wire.      
        
   Speed   
 The SWIFT payment network is slow. It originated in the 1970s before the advent of the Internet and hasn't changed much. Allow 3-5 days for a successful transfer.            
        
   Process   
 SWIFT sends two messages, one with account information and one with the actual funds. The message with funds may take an extra 1-2 days to clear before it is available in the client's bank account.            
        
   Assistance   
 The SWIFT payment network is complicated. Wire instructions can be confusing and the standardization of forms does not yet exist. We're experts, come to us for help.
