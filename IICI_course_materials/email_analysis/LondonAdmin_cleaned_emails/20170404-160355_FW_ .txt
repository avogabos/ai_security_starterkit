Hi Charlotte, hope you are well.
I spoke to this client, he is saying that he came to our office last week
and paid GBP 275  for 1 year mail forwarding service and provided his
documents etc to a lady he met. Pls check and advice as I can't find his
order on admin report. Thanks

Hello Sarah

 

I refer to our telephone conversations a few minutes ago. I have signed up
and paid for a year for the post service, I think it was early last week. My
full company name is Cigna Ltd trading as Stewart Herman & Co. I look
forward to receiving my ID number.

 

Regards

 

Stewart
