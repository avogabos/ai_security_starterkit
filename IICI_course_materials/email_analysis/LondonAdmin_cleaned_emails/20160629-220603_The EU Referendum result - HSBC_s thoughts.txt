The UK has decided to leave the European Union
The UK has voted to leave the EU.  There has been a lot of debate in recent months on what the outcome of this referendum will mean for the UK.  Now we know the result we can work together and focus on the future.
Commenting on the referendum result, the Group Chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, said:
“
We are today entering a new era for Britain and British business. The work to establish fresh terms of trade with our European and global partners will be complex and time consuming. We will be working tirelessly in the coming weeks and months to help our customers adjust and to prepare for the new environment.
As one of the largest, most stable, liquid and prudential financial institutions in the world, HSBC is well placed to support our customers and the markets as they deal with the challenges that will arise. Our commitment to British business, customers and staff in the UK remains undiminished.
”
As the landscape evolves we will continue to keep you informed about any changes which may impact you.
If you would like to discuss your own business situation, please do not hesitate to contact your Relationship Manager, Business Telephone Banking on
