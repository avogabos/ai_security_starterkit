Hello Nadya,

HK Company
Old Name: -    LAMPRELL (PLC) LIMITED
New Name:  LAMPRELL FUND MANAGEMENT LTD


We have received a court notice with the penalty; reason because the consent
to act as a director has not been submitted for this company. I spoke to
Tahir and he asked me to email you a blank copy of consent to act as a
director and the scanned documents I sent you for this company on April 07,
2015. Tahir said we did post the document to HK registry but since it was
sent out to them by first class delivery the mails must have been lost.

So he asked me to email you the copies so that you may copy the signature on
the consent to act as director form and post this to HK by Recorded
Delivery, also post them the share transfer form attached pls.

I have mentioned the new company name on the consent to act as a director
document for this company.

Also check and confirm if you have sent consent to act as a director and
share transfer form for same client for following companies;

- Vanguard Petroleum Limited (LTD - Hong Kong)
- VISA EXPRESS LIMITED (LTD - Hong Kong)

Please check and confirm.

 

Regards,



Rachel
