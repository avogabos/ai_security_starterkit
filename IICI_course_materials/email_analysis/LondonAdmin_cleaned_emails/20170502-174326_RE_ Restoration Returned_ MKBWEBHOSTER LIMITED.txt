Hey Micheal, 

 

I actually wrote them a cheque for £2330.00

 

Outstanding penalty of £750 for the 31/08/13 accounts.

Annual Accounts for period end 31/08/15 and late filing  penalty of £1500.

Annual Returns (Form AR01) for period end 21/10/15 and filing fee of £40.

 

Form CS01 (Confirmation Statement and Parts 1-5) for period end 10/11/16 and
filing fee of £40.

I have just realized that the 100GBP filing fee for the restoration is
missing. So this 1680GBP doesnt make sense to me.?! I will sort it out once
I get the letter. 

 

Thank you for the heads up. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
