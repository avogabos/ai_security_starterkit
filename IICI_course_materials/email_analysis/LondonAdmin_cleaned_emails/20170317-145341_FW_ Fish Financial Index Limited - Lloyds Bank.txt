Thank you for your polite response. We would like to make the payment for the mail forwarding service by credit card.

How can we pay?

 

Also, can you please confirm if you have a copy of an old application form for signatory transfer of Lloyds Bank account?

 

As another request, could you please call the bank and check if they have already issued a authorization card to your address on our behalf? Mr Shibata is not good at speaking English so we really need your help. The phone number of the bank is 03453000116. If the security is necessary, we will call instead so can you please try at least once?

Re: Fish Financial Index Limited - Lloyds Bank
Dear
Sarah,
Thank
you for your polite response. We would like to make the payment for the mail
forwarding service by credit card.
How
can we pay?
Also,
can you please confirm if you have a copy of an old application form for
signatory transfer of Lloyds Bank account?
As
another request, could you please call the bank and check if they have already
issued a authorization card to your address on our behalf? Mr Shibata is not
good at speaking English so we really need your help. The phone number of the
bank is 03453000116. If the security is necessary, we will call instead so can
you please try at least once?
We
look forward to hearing from you.
