His major activity now and what he would like to have in new Company is SHIP REGISTRATION and inspection, for various client, not for regular ones.

 

I talk with him and he told me that he hardy can precisely terminate from which bank will be the transfers and from which clients.

 

What can he send for help?

Mitja,

 

We would only be able to refund the amount if we are not able to provide the service. We are still able to provide you with the bank account and our team has spent a lot of hours working on your case but you need to understand that your client needs to provide the appropriate documents in order for us to open a bank account for him. The requirement for a corporate account that we require is from the bank directly and it would apply to any  other bank he would go to open the account in.I am sure you are aware of the due diligence that the bank does with every profile.

Dear Felix,

 

I'm really disappointed and must say my client also lost all the confidence and wishes to discontinue the proceedings.

I have ask you which documents and you wrote document’s , not passport copy. 

I send it on Monday, nobody replied that something is missing, and only  after my yesterday’s e-mail, you reply today that again is not good.

 

I informed about this and also about new requirements for 3 and 6 month statements, and he said that ho doesn’t believe me (us) anymore and would like to have back his money from me.

 

I do not have any other alternative, so please check possibility about the returning of my founds  (500 GBP) which I have send you in May already.

 

My client said, as I return his found he may try to collect documents and when he see the result he will pay again, but now he request as soon as possible recovery of funds for Bank opening.

 

Check and inform me. I may get order for Power Of Attorney, so if so you can deduct that amount, and I will pay whole amount to my client.

 

Please reply a.s.ap.

The passport you sent me was not certified, This is causing a delay as you are not sending me the complete documents as per requirement, The bill that you sent you did not certify the translation copy, We need 6 months back statement and a 3 month bank statement as well. Please send me all the documents at once so we can proceed. Do not send it to me in different emails.

 

I have submitted the documents to the bank thrice already and have got a negative response.

 

Please send it a.s.a.p.

Mitja,

 

Please note that in order to change the citizenship of the director AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD for the company 

DRCSR INTERNATIONAL SHIP REGISTRATION LIMITED we will have to terminate the current director and appoint the 

same person with the correct details.

Also we have checked that you transferred 1000 shares from ALLAA ELDIN DRWICH to AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD.

So once Mr. AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD (direct) will be appointed with the correct details we may again transfer 

1000 shares to Mr. AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD (appointed with correct details).


Therefore kindly provide us the confirmation if we go ahead to make the changes in your company.

Felix Almeida.

You changed the director but can you confirm the nationality of the new director as it shows British which I don’t think is correct, Secondly you also need to remove the old director from the shares which you have not done.

 

Please scan and send it to me.

 

As for the New Elevation I will place the order and you can update the payment for Apostille and General Power of Attorney. Would you require express Apostille which is for £300 7 business days or normal which is for £150.

Banks around the world have their own rules, You take any offshore banks and ask them to open a n account for Iranian or US citizen and they will say NO…Right up till 2015 they were two citizens that we rejected but due to the Issues in Syria as you are aware the banks have put a third name on the list that we were not notified. We are trying our level best as you can see to provide you with what we promised but the bank account opening at times do take time and is beyond our control. But rest assure I have kept it on top priority.

Felix,
His major activity now and what he would like to have in new Company is SHIP REGISTRATION and inspection, for various client, not for regular ones.
I talk with him and he told me that he hardy can precisely terminate from which bank will be the transfers and from which clients.
What can he send for help?
Please also check my previous e-mail concerning EPOCH YACHTS , owners Birthday date:
Correct is 03 April 1960.
Can you  change in the application? I already pay with card this order.

We would only be able to refund the amount if we are not able to provide the service. We are still able to provide you with the bank account and our team has spent a lot of hours working on your case but you need to understand that your client needs to provide the appropriate documents in order for us to open a bank account for him. The requirement for a corporate account that we require is from the bank directly and it would apply to any  other bank he would go to open the account in.I am sure you are aware of the due diligence that the bank does with every profile.

Felix Almeida.

Dear Felix,
I'm
really disappointed and must say my client also lost
all the confidence and wishes to discontinue the proceedings.
I have ask you which documents and you wrote document’s , not passport copy.
I send it on Monday, nobody replied that something is missing, and only  after my yesterday’s e-mail, you reply today that again is not good.
I informed about this and also about new requirements for 3 and 6 month statements, and he said that ho doesn’t believe me (us) anymore and would like to have back his money from me.
I do not have any other alternative, so please check possibility about the returning of my founds  (500 GBP) which I have send you in May already.
My client said, as I return his found he may try to collect documents and when he see the result he will pay again, but now he request as soon as possible recovery of funds for Bank opening.
Check and inform me. I may get order for Power Of Attorney, so if so you can deduct that amount, and I will pay whole amount to my client.
Please reply a.s.ap.

The passport you sent me was not certified, This is causing a delay as you are not sending me the complete documents as per requirement, The bill that you sent you did not certify the translation copy, We need 6 months back statement and a 3 month bank statement as well. Please send me all the documents at once so we can proceed. Do not send it to me in different emails.
I have submitted the documents to the bank thrice already and have got a negative response.
Please send it a.s.a.p.

Please note that in order to change the citizenship of the director AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD for the company
DRCSR INTERNATIONAL SHIP REGISTRATION LIMITED we will have to terminate the current director and appoint the
same person with the correct details.
Also we have checked that you transferred 1000 shares from ALLAA ELDIN DRWICH to AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD.
So once Mr. AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD (direct) will be appointed with the correct details we may again transfer
1000 shares to Mr. AHMAD ZOUHIAR DARWEESH ZEYAD (appointed with correct details).
Therefore kindly provide us the confirmation if we go ahead to make the changes in your company.

Felix Almeida.

You changed the director but can you confirm the nationality of the new director as it shows British which I don’t think is correct, Secondly you also need to remove the old director from the shares which you have not done.
Please scan and send it to me.
As for the New Elevation I will place the order and you can update the payment for Apostille and General Power of Attorney. Would you require express Apostille which is for £300 7 business days or normal which is for £150.

Banks around the world have their own rules, You take any offshore banks and ask them to open a n account for Iranian or US citizen and they will say NO…Right up till 2015 they were two citizens that we rejected but due to the Issues in Syria as you are aware the banks have put a third name on the list that we were not notified. We are trying our level best as you can see to provide you with what we promised but the bank account opening at times do take time and is beyond our control. But rest assure I have kept it on top priority.

Dear Felix,
That is very unusual, that now you ask for some additional documents?
We have send out all requested documentation with DHL yesterday, which we got from our client on Monday.
What shall we do now? I need to consult with him.
In case he refuse, can you send back all documentation and our advance payment??
I'm also agent for Loyal Bank from SVG, and they haven't ask for such things till now.
Waiting for your reply.
Kind regards, Mitja
