Re: Billing of services to 15 Jubilee Court, Kingsbury, Tamworth, B78 2LL.

 

Please note that we have received a bill for the company The Boutique, Suite B 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR.

 

The company The Boutique Ltd (company number 047614470) is a non trading company. It is not trading or connected to the address 15 Jubilee Court, Kingsbury, Tamworth B78 2LL and it has never been.

 

There is however a shop called the Boutique which is operating at that address by Miss Helen Mason (a quick google search gives me this info). 

 

Please can you remove the association in your system of the company The Boutique Ltd (29 Harley Street) from the service address for the billing, as this company does not trade and therefore should not have any bills or debts.

 

Please let me know if you need any further information

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
