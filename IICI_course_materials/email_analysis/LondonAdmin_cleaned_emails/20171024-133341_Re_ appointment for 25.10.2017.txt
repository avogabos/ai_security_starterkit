Dear Mr. Kuhn, 

 

Please may we book an appointment with you for tomorrow morning? We would need one standard set of company documents notarised and a divorce paper issued from the court and then it would need an apostille. 

 

Would you be able to notarise a copy of the attached, Danielle will bring the original with her tomorrow. Attached to the divorce paper is a certified translation in Russian that does not need to be notarised (which you would not be able to do anyway). 

 

We can provide with you OLGA FIODOROVNA CRAWFORD’S original passport also if required? 

 

I look forward to hearing from you. 

 

Kind regards
