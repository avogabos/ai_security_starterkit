Hi Shawn, 

 

Just checked it all good. 

 

Do you still want me to charge the card?

 

Thanks

Hi Nadya,

 

Please find attached Credit Card Authorization form with card holder
identification documents.

 

The provided proof of address (Utility Bill) seems to be in Russian language
with its translation. Could you please verify the original if it is correct.

Could you please then charge 400 GBP?

 

Thanks
