Hi,

 

The payslips which Fahad used to email you or Charlotte, that included the amount of Child support which was supposed to be paid. Attached are the payslips from April onwards for your review.

 

The amount needs to be paid as soon as it is deducted from the employee salary.

 

Regards,

Umair
