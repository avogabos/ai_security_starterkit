Dear Companies House,

 

I hope all is well with you.

 

GEMS REAL ESTATE LTD 

Company number: 07428968

 

We would like to manually submit the change of registered officer address
form for the above mentioned company as we do not have the authentication
code. However, the company's Confirmation Statement is OVERDUE since
18/10/2016 and the status of the company is Active - proposal to strike off.
Please confirm if it is possible for us to manually submit the change of
registered office address form so that we may then apply for a new
authentication code and then file the confirmation statement for the
company.

 

We await your confirmation in this regard.

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael Gomes
