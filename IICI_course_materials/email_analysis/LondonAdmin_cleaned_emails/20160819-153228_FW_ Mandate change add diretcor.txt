Hi,

 

I have attached the forms that are required to add a new director to your
account. If the new party is not a personal customer with RBS, they will
need to provide two forms of identification (please see id table).

 

Please also update companies house if you haven't already.

 

If you have any further questions or query, please call us on 0845 307 0900,
Monday - Friday, 8am-8pm and Saturday, 9am-2pm.

 

Kind regards,

 

Abdulfatah Hassan
