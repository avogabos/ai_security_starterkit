Oliver

I received the following email yesterday, from Euro Pacific Bank Ltd, requesting I fill in the enclosed 'Bank Account Pre-Approval' form.

This information was submitted to you on September 22nd, at this time I had been waiting for you to send me the forms for 5 days, and you confirmed that there was an error in your system and they hadn't been sent. 

You resent them, and I immediately filled them in, sent them back to you, and you confirmed their receipt.

My obvious concern now, is that your company still hasn't submitted this information.

I confirmed at the beginning of this arrangement, the importance of this banking facility, in relation to the Smart Tech Company becoming operational.

A close friend and business associate, Ian Selby, recommended you to me, and I am afraid I have to say, I feel more disappointed and concerned by the day, over this complete transaction from start to finish.

Can somebody please inform me exactly what is going on, and the time scale for completion.

Regards

Mark Barnett
