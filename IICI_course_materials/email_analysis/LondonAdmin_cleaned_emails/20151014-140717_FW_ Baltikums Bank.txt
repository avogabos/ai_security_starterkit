I have a couple of questions before we move forward.


1.       What is the benefit we get from sending customers that require
banking facilities to you.

2.       If agreed is the agreement between our company and your bank done
remotely.

3.       We have a lot of clients who would also like personal accounts do
you work on those as well.

4.       What are the citizens and business activities that you do not
entertain.

5.       What are the fees that the customer would have to bear in terms of
banking charges once the account is opened or in the opening stage.

6.       Do you also provide merchant accounts and if so what are the terms
and conditions along with rates.
These are a few questions if you could answer so we can move to the next
phase.

Regards,

Felix Almeida.
