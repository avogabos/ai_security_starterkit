Dear Mrs Pawar, 

 

I hope you are well.

I tried to contact you earlier, however there was no answer. Please call me
back as soon as possible to discuss your business account, and whether or
not it is being transferred over to Mr Kimyonok. This is because some forms
will need to be completed by yourself in order to carry out the process. 

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Kind regards,
