Hi Billy

That's fine but it should refer to sale rather than purchase and ideally needs to refer to the company owning the property and being able to sell it

Kind regards

I don't think point 3 is possible. Please call me back I'm now at my desk :)

We need a solicitor to write a letter stating along these lines:
The company fairway carslisle with company no and registered at ... , in accordance with the laws of Seychelles, has no impedence or legal restraint from the purchase of property in any international location including United Kingdom.
