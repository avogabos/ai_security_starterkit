Hi Mark/ Philipp

 

The company details:

 

Name: Mobile Electrics  

Inc Date: 11th June 2013

Company Registration number: 08565009

 

The SIC is updated and was done when the new director appointment was
submitted.

 

To view all company documents and forms go to www.formationshouse.com
<http://www.formationshouse.com>  and select My account

The login for the account is:

Username: 38636713

Password: 12345

 

You can update the password if you need. Under UK Company Admin you will
find all other information

 

For tomorrow 

Natwest  Please come to the office at 2pm, Nadya will get forms done and
then she will go to Natwest with Philipp.

 

We have been unable to get an appointment at RBS

My suggestion is this

As extra bank account opening is paid for, let me fill in online for HSBC
and for one other such as Barclays/ RBS or Lloyds .. without additional
charge.

 

I will get the login for the website control panel by Monday next week, and
the email access also. 

 

For the VAT representative as mentioned, you will require a VO for £550 per
year with the extra phone number as agreed at no extra cost.

You will also be required to purchase our Complete Accounting which includes
VAT filing for £900 per year.

 

I will shortly email some questions for the HSBC account application.

 

Kind Regards

 

Charlotte
