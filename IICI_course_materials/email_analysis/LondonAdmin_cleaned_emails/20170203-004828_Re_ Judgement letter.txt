Hi Nadya,

Thanks. That judgement should have been removed as it's now over 6 years.

In any case, I paid it last November, and I sent the attached info, along with an application for a certificate of satisfaction to the High Court a week ago. I am yet to receive the certificate.

Best regards,
Jason
