Thank you for your email.

Dear Rachel,


Thank you for your email with the respective company order.

 

While we are pleased to accept your order, we would like to remind you that
once the share capital exceeds $50,000, the government registration fees
alone increases to $1000.  The fees for formation will be $1145 and all
renewal fees thereafter will be $1100.00.  So, we will need a further
confirmation that you understand the increase in the government fees before
we proceed with the company's registration.

 

Additionally, we have been reviewing our receivables and realized that your
firm has some long outstanding receivables that will be required to be
cleared.  We will need for these to be settled in line with the 30 days
credit term granted for your firm.  Any amount outstanding beyond this
period would be required to be settled at your earliest opportunity.  This
will prevent our Accounting department to place your account on cash basis
so I would encourage you to settle the amounts due.  I attach a recent
statement of account reflecting the amounts due for your kind attention.

 

Do note that we are happy to work with you and will be looking forward for
your reply so that we may proceed accordingly. 

 

Thanks and best regards,

 

Jaialai
