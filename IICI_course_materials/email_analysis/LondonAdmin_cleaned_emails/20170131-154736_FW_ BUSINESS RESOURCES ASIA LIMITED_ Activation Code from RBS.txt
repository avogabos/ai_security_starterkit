Dear Sarah,

 

Have you confirmed the bank when we can receive the device? If it takes time, we may need to have other letters and debit card sent to us first.

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,

Dear Sarah,

 

Thank you for your reply. We have our client waited for this account transfer so long so do not want to ask them to call the bank directly by themselves. If you can confirm on our behalf, it will be better for us. Are you really sure that we can receive the device by the next week?

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email

 

Please note that we expect to receive it by next week. The director can contact RBS directly regarding an update as he is now the account holder as he has been added.

 

Regards,

 

Sarah
