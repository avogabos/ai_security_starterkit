Dear Felix,

 

Hope you are doing good. There were a couple of things:

 

1. I had paid for the filling of annual return on the Formations House website, but I still keep getting emails to file the annual return. Even in my online account it still says for filling the annual return. Has the return not been filled yet?

 

2. I tried to renew the Annual services, but for some reason the payment did not go through. Could I please get the renewal link again in my account.

 

3. As you know, the bank account has still not been opened, as there was a delay in investments in the UK. I will let you know once I am ready to open it so that you could set the meeting.

 

Thanks.

 

Regards,

Inderneel Bhalla
