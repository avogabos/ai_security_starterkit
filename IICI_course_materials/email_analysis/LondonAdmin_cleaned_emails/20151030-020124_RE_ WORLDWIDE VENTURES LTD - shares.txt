Dear Nadya,

I researched my file record, but I could not locate such record for filing your attached Instrument of transfer.  As normally once I receive your instruction, I will request you to sign a letter (attached) and pass all originals includes a Bought & Sold Note to me to file.  Please check.

Thanks,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

I believe we asked you back in December 2014 or possibly at the beginning of January 2015 to file the instrument of transfer for WORLDWIDE VENTURES LTD at the Inland Revenue. Please could you kindly check and confirm?

Many thanks
