For KYC of HSBC, usually they will request the original identity and residential address proof. Besides, may ask the personal bank statement
of director, as may know the source of fund. Also whether have any business proof can provide (any related proposed agreement), etc.

Dear Aela,
We have a new client who will be visiting Hong Kong in a few weeks.
We will be ordering a Virtual Office/ Mailing Address for him and a registered address service for his Hong Kong company.
I wanted to ask if you know the KYC requirements for HSBC bank in Hong Kong,
I also wanted to ask if your company offer Nominee Director and or Nominee Secretary services for Hong Kong companies where there is a joint UK director for the Hong Kong company.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya
