Dear Felix,

 

Thank you for your reply, even it's very negative for me. I offered to my client package Company formation + bank account opening, and without Bank, he can refuse also to have Company which he cannot use for what he was planning to.

 

Do you have any other alternative?
You mentioned: 

- to change director with some non-Syrian Citizen and thank change back??

- any global offshore Company??

 

If we don't have any alternative and he refuse to have UK company as well, can we change the name and director and use it instead a new Company I like to form??

 

Please send me your opinion as I need quickly to find some solution.

 

If there will not be any alternative I will send you instructions to send back money and documents.

 

Waiting for your reply.

Kind regards, Mitja

Mitja,

 

I just got a conformation it’s impossible to open a bank account for the director due to the restructions.We can issue you a credit note for the 500 out of which we can pay for the new company you have formed and another company that follows. I have asked the bank to send me a written request which I will forward to you. Let me know how to proceed so we can move forward.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

Dear Felix,

 

I'm still waiting info for Bank opening for which I paid on 12th of May 2015 (500 GBP).
Isn't it possible to form a company and if you succeed to solve Bank I pay the difference. 

You promise me also some official comment, which I can forward to my client, whom I promise to send already a week ago.

 

Please reply.

Mitja
