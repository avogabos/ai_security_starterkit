Dear Mrs. Crawford,

The bank transfer for the payment of your invoice has been executed
yesterday. I think you will receive the funds in 2 days max. from now. When
you will receive the funds, please wait until the 26th October 2017 for
sending all the post mail to the following address:

Cloud Commerce Ltd
C/O Mathias Yun
Via Cantonale 35E

because I am traveling abroad until that date.

My contact phone number is: +41.797.867.201

Dear Customer,
Please see attached letter for your perusal.
We have also received some non-governmental mail in your company name. It seems it has come from the Registry of Shipping.
You would need to purchase our Virtual Office Mailing address for a minimum of 3 months which would be £135GBP (incl. set-up fee and VAT). You will then have a wallet service you can top up online for the cost of postage which would be taken off accordingly. Alternatively we can hold the post for you for collection from our Harley Place Office.
Please advise if this would be of interest to you I would then be able to place an order for you.
Alternatively we can see this as a one off and send it out to an address provided by courier for a fee.
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Kind regards
