Dear Customer,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please advise if you would like to use our Nominee Director service or appoint your own director in the company? 

 

Also note that we are regulated under HMRC policy for Money Laundering Regulations, as we are a business services provider. To maintain this they expect a high level of compliance in how we address the Know Your Customer policy. We have always had a high level of compliance but the UK laws are strict and getting stricter and so we have reviewed our current process. 

 

As a reseller, you are required to provide us your identification documents. We will require your Passport Copy and a valid proof of address for verification. 

 

Also, we will require the below identification documents for the company director/s & shareholders:

 

1. Proof of ID (copy of passport or driving license)

2. Proof of Residence (i.e. any letter from bank containing the name & address or a copy of your bank statement dated within the last 3 months)

3. Intended Business Activity of the company in detail

4. Monthly and Annual Turnover of the company.

 

The above items can be sent as a scanned copy by email.

 

We look forward to hear from you.

 

Regards,

 

Sarah
