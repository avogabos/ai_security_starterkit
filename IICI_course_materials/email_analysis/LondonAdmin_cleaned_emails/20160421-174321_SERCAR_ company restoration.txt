Dear Madam, 

Re:    SERCAR LIMITED 

Company No. -  09219395 

Thank you for your email concerning the restoration of the company. 

The company was dissolved due to non compliance of the Companies Act , the
annual return for 2015 was outstanding a series of  notices was sent to the
registered office address , and one of which was sent to the officers at
their service address. 

As no reply was received wither in the form of the outstanding annual
return, letter or e mail the dissolution of the company continued until the
company was struck off on 3 December 2015 

If you intend to continue trading with the company it can be restored to the
register by filing the following documents: 

1) Form RT01 together with the £100.00 filing fee. 

2) The annual returns for 15/09/2015, with the total filing fee of £40.00. 

4) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered online
at www.bonavacantia.gov.uk 

If the company is being restored for any other reason than to continue
trading, to recover assets for example, you would need to apply to a Court
for a Restoration Order. Details on this process are available online at
www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-company-restoration 

Please note however that if there are no assets remaining in the company you
may prefer to incorporate a new company. You can re-use the original name if
that name is still available when you apply. Further information on company
incorporations is available from the Companies House website. 

I hope that this information is of use to you but if you need any further
help please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Yours sincerely 
Gaynor Davies
