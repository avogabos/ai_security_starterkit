Hi,

 

There are no VAT certificates for APEX DISTRIBUTORS LTD and MASTERTEX LTD in
the accounts folder here.

 

Could you please check these certificates once again in your records, as
client needs it urgently.

 

Also there is another company KALLKI INTERNATIONAL expecting an HMRC letter
from more than 3 weeks. Could you please check this as well?

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

 

Thank you
