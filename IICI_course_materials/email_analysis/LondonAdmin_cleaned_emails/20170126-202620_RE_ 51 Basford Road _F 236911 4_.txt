This is what they require:

 

1.	they have carried out all necessary company searches with the
Seychelles Registrar of Companies; and
2.	they have reviewed and settled the corporate authorisations of
Fairway Carlyle Corporation; and
3.	confirm that, in their opinion, Fairway Carlyle Corporation own the
property and can enter in to a contract to sell it and that the attached
transfer deed has been properly executed and is, in their opinion,
enforceable.

 

Please confirm correct wordings so I can email them and confirm.
