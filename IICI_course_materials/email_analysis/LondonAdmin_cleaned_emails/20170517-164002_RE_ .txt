Hi Anthony,

Yes that's fine we will charge you 150GBP for the first 3 months.

Please confirm that the name we will set you up will be "TRUP LIMITED" and
then I can set you up on our system. I will then notify the mail department
to take anything with that name in it.

Please also provide a drivers licence or copy of passport. 

Kind regards
Nadya

Hi Nadya

Would you mind if I see how things go initially and pay for 3 months to
begin with and if everything goes fine then I will pay for the rest of the
year.

Is that Ok with you?

Kind Regards

Anthony
