Good Afternoon,

Case Reference: 14725652 

Thank you for your email and attached documents. 

We would require a few amendments making to the documents to allow us to accept and proceed with the transfer process:

Transfer Form

We need the attached transfer form completing for the new company. I have attached a guide to this email to assist with completion.

Company Headed Letter

*	Please hand-sign the document. Unfortunately an electronic signature cannot be accepted. 
*	The letter would need to show a date within the last 7 days.
*	Please remove your request for the data and international dialling to be enabled as your numbers would just transfer to your new company as they currently are. 
*	It needs to state your request of transferring the numbers from one company name to another.

The above amendments would need to be returned within the next 7 days to avoid restrictions.

If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Kind Regards, 

Louise Paveling

Dear Insolvancy,

 

Further to a recent telephone conversation with Danielle Ardern, director of the dissolved Accounts Centre international Ltd, I attach the required documents to novate the numbers over to a new agreement with AC Online Ltd. 

 

Please let me know if you need anything further to process this as we are keen to ensure we don’t get any disruption of service

 

Kind Regards

Charlotte Pawar
