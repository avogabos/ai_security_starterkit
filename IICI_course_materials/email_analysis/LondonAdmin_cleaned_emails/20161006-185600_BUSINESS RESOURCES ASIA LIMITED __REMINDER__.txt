Dear Sarah,

 

Please find the amended translation of his account statement and the certificate of bank balance attached.

 

We would like you to please specify the required documents clearly. Please send us the list of all the required documents and we can prepare for them correctly.

If these documents are not acceptable, he actually has a bank account in Mongolia but visiting the bank is the only way to order the bank reference letter. Is it faster if he visits there and obtain his bank reference letter?

 

Please make all possible haste for our client.

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Best Regards,

Dear Sarah,

 

 

Thank you for your reply.

 

We will ask the translator to correct the word, thank you.

 

As we advised, certificate of bank balance is the only document which can be issued in English and in Japan, companies do not put its logo (trademark) on the official statement in common. Please tell over that to the bank.

 

We would like you to please send us all the lists of required documents.

Which documents need to be notarized? Please specify clearly and we will request them to our client.

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Best Regards,
