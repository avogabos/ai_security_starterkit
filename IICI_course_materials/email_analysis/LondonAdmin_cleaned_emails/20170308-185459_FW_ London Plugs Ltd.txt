Dear Nadia

 

You have not cleared to me that you need it to be stamped from Tunisian Consulate in the UK.

 

I have get it notarized from Notary. Stamping from Tunisian consulate is expensive.

 

What I can do is get it done to you for 350 GBP. (we do not charge our services fee)

 

That all I can do

 

Best regards

Dear Nadia

 

We can do the following for you

 

As this Power of Attorney is already notarized

We can get it stamped from consulate of Tunisia in UK

 

They charge for this, the cost will be 500 GBP.

 

And it takes around 7 – 10 working days, as you know these are consulate matters.

 

Best regards
