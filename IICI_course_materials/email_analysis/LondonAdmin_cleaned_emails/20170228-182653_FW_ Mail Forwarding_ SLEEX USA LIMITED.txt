Dear sirs,



I am wondering whether for my company SLEEX USA Limited, that I have
registered with you, I have post lying at

your offices.



The company is newly registered but the mail forwarding service is active
and the wallet has money in it. I have

just checked.



So I am wondering whether you could check whether there is post at your
office. If so, could you send it as

soon as possible please?



Is there a setting I need to change in the system to determine in which
frequency I would like the mail forwarded or

is this automatic?



Thanks in advance for getting back.



Kind regards

Corinna
