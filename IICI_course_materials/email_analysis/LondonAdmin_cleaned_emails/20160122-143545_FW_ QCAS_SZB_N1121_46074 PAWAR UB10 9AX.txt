Dear Sirs,

Further to your below email to Mrs Parwar, please note we have not received the signed Legal Charge from you or your undertaking to deal with any requisitions regarding the same.

The document enclosed with your letter dated 17th December was in fact a draft Legal Charge. We informed you in our email of the 23rd December (see attached) that the details of panel 5 and 6 of the draft charge needed to be amended to show your clients details as opposed to Nationwide Building Society.

As we are now in receipt of the advance monies from Nationwide Building Society, please provide us with a copy of the amended and signed CH1 together with your undertaking to forward the same on receipt of the £70,000 consideration due to your client on completion and to deal with any requisitions raised by the Land Registry.

We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards
Karen

Dear Charlotte,

Thank you for your email.

The executed Legal Charge has been sent to QCAS and I await an undertaking from them that they will send to us £70,000.00 upon receipt of the remortgage monies at which time I will release the papers I have sent to them which they are holding to my order.

I also await an undertaking from QCAS that they will register the Legal Charge for the remaining monies owed with the new mortgagee upon completion.

Kind regards,

Emma Faulkner

Dear Emma,

QCAS have informed me they wrote to you on Wednesday to request a document relating to the Legal Charge which has been accepted by Nationwide.
Currently I am mid way through the grace period given by Nationwide to complete.

Please can you confirm when you have responded and supplied the request to QCAS, as if it can be done with haste I could still complete before the 21st and therefore not need to reapply for a new mortgage offer.

Kind Regards
Charlotte Pawar

Dear Charlotte,

The documents were sent to QCAS on the 17th December 2015 and I have heard nothing back save for an email dated the 23rd December 2015 confirming that they have referred the Legal Charge to Nationwide for confirmation of instructions that they are happy to proceed.

Have you heard any further from QCAS?
