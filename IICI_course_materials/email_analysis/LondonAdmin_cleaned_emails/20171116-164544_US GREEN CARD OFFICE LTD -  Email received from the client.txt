Hello Support

Unfortunately it looks like my mail has been lost in transit :o//

Can you please confirm what address you send the mail to?

I have 24 hours security at my place so a bit surprised it was not delivered
if the address is correct.

Please confirm ASAP so I can contact Thai Post for further investigation. 

Sincerely,

US GREEN CARD OFFICE LTD
