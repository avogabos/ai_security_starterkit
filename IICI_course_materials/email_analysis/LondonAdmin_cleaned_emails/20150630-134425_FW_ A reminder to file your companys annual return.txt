Dear Customer, 

We wish to remind you of the due date(s) for filing of the Annual Return(s)
for: 


INTERPATH LTD        Jun 26, 2015

It is a mandatory requirement for a company to file its Annual Return with
Companies House. An Annual Return is a snapshot of general information about
a company's Director(s) and Secretary, registered office address,
shareholders and share capital. If the Annual Returns are filed late, or not
at all, the Company and its Director(s) and Secretary are liable for
prosecution.

To help you in quick and efficient Annual Return (and other relevant)
filing(s), Formations House offers an Online Company Administrator service.
Online Company Administrator can help you file your Annual Return for your
company within minutes. Subscribers to the Online Company Administrator can
simply go to the Formation House website www.formationshouse.com
