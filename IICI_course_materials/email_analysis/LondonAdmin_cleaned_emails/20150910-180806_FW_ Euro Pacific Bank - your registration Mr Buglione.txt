Dear Jaap, Felix

 

Please find here enclosed the new release of the documents. I have tried to be as specific as possible as, in the requirements expressed in your last communication,  there was no reference on what specifically was needed instead of what produced.


In case your compliance dpt. needs any further information please, do not hesitate and, being specific, tell me what I can help them with and I will do so accordingly.

 

I hope that by now mr Felix Almeida sent you the two non complete documentations here below reported:

Notarized Copy of Memorandum & Articles of Association/Incorporation OR Articles of Incorporation & Bylaws

The missing pages of the Memorandum & Articles of Association 

 

If not yet done, please, Mr Felix provide us with this. If yes discharge this message.

Mr FELIX: be also aware that the company office has to be amended in the following one:

 

Office Address:

MB NLP Training&Consulting Limited
C/O The Accountancy Partnership
Offices A13 & A14,
Champions Business Park,
Arrowe Brook Road,
Upton,
Wirral
CH49 0AB

 

Trading Address:

Marcello Buglione

Via Alcide De Gasperi 81

26812 Borghetto Lodigiano

Lodi

Italia

(this is the address where all the correspondence between the bank and me has to be sent. We warmly  you suggest to use email and pdf instead)

 

My wishing now is that everything will be falling in as we are all in CC and no further misunderstanding will occur.

 

Jaap: I long for your kind reply on the new documents sent after your revision if they are ok and meet the expectation.

 

All the best everyone and thank you.
