Nadya,

 

 

Thanks Forwarding it to him now. Please also do update me on the other
emails one for the Apostille which you received, I sent you the address
where it has to be sent and second the company restoration.

 

Sorry my icq is not working so you may just send me an email or pass the
message on through Shawn.

 

Felix.

Hi Felix, 

 

Please see attached. It came in yesterday. I have highlighted in yellow what
I think he should provide. 

 

Seeing that he is a resident outside of the UK and I guess he will not want
to come into branch I suggest he provides the ones I have highlighted in
Table B if he sends scanned version for me to check first and then he can
send the originals to me and then I can then send it on to the bank. 

 

Many thanks!

is worried as he has not heard from them as of yet.
