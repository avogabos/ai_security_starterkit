Hello Sarah,

 

We are in London now, can we pop by your office and sign the papers with you? That way we can also discuss the whole process.

 

Best regards,

Eyvi.

Hi Sarah,

 

Do I need to fill out any additional information on the pages or are the forms completed and ready for signature? I see that one of the files is 62 pages long, I’m not an expert at these things and I do not want to make any mistakes. Can you advise?

 

Many thanks and

Best regards,

Eyvi.
