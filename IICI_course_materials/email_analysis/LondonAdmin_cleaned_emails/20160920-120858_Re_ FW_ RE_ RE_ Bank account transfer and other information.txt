Dear Phillip/Mark,
Please see attached letter for your perusal. It states that:
'Mr. Riesenbeck will need to take his identification ie
Passport, driving licence and utility bill to his Solicitor or Notary and for then to arrange for them to copy and certify the id'.
I would also strongly advise to provide certified 6 months bank statements as it states in the second attachment of bank forms page 2 under proof of identity. Please see attached for your perusal.
Please scan all the
certified ID
so that I may check before you send the originals to our office in Harley street.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya

Hi
So the bank confirmed we are waiting on the original proofs of address, and 6 months bank statements as requested in the email we sent
As you are unable to present in person, you will need to get all of them certified at the german embassy wherever you are located.
And must be clearly in English,
Thanks

Hi Mark/ Philipp
The company details:
Name: Mobile Electrics
Inc Date: 11
th
June 2013
Company Registration number: 08565009
The SIC is updated and was done when the new director appointment was submitted.
To view all company documents and forms go to
www.formationshouse.com
and select My account
The login for the account is:
Username: 38636713
Password: 12345

For tomorrow
Natwest â Please come to the office at 2pm, Nadya will get forms done and then she will go to Natwest with Philipp.
We have been unable to get an appointment at RBS
My suggestion is this
As extra bank account opening is paid for, let me fill in online for HSBC and for one other such as Barclays/ RBS or Lloyds .. without additional charge.
I will get the login for the website control panel by Monday next week, and the email access also.
For the VAT representative as mentioned, you will require a VO for Â£550 per year with the extra phone number as agreed at no extra cost.
You will also be required to purchase our Complete Accounting which includes VAT filing for Â£900 per year.
I
will shortly email some questions for the HSBC account application.
Kind Regards
Charlotte
