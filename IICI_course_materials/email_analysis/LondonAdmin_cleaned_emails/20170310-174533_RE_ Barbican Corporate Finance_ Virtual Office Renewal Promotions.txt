Dear Philip,

Thank you for your email.

Please note that I have checked the records and the payments were indeed waived off in 2011. Your Hosting service on barbicancorporatefinance.co.uk is up-to-date and will be due for renewal on 2017-08-29.

Regarding bocfe.co.uk, please re-confirm that you would like us to deactivate our hosting service on this domain.

Also, you can make a total payment of GBP 667 to AC ONLINE LTD.

We look forward to hear from you.

Regards,

Sarah
Formations House

Sarah

 

Thank you for your message. 

 

I have never been previously advised of any arrears for 2013/14; 2014/15 and 2016/17 hosting services charges for barbicancorporatefinance.co.uk. My records indicate that my company has paid for these charges (cheque nos. 010207; 010213; 010216; 010218; 010220)

 

Please note that I have repeatedly stated in the past that I did not wish to renew hosting services for bocfe.co.uk. Indeed Mr Khan also agreed previously that I have no arrears for these services.

 

Best Regards

 

Philip
