Ok, ihave read through the ic laws.

If the letter can refer that the ibc company is subject to the laws of ibc syechelles 2016 including points (and then include the points)
Part IX 177 (1) descriptions of property - states wherever situated
Part II - 5 - 2B - states can own immoveable property but not in Seychelles

Thanks

Hi Charlotte,

https://www.sendspace.com/file/n2m9na

Above is the link from where you may download the laws of IBC Seychelles, I tried to download but I am unable to send as the size of the file is 50 MB.

This has been sent by AC Management.

Hi Billy
We have checked with multiple solicitors and all refuse to do this letter. The spotlight on offshore assets has been increasing and I think they are being cautious, overly so.
The best we can get is an Incumbancy certificate which states the company is in good standing in accordance of the law of Seychelles, who the owners/shareholders are etc.
I am going to personally read through th mem and arts doc for the company too as there may be an explicit point in there that the solicitor can accept

Will let you know but its worth talking to the solicitor again to see if there is a way around
Thanks
