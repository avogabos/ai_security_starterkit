Dear Danielle, 

 

I was very disappointed that when I met you today to collect my post you walked off when I asked you what the arrangements are going forward.

 

You had told me previously that after moving from 29 then 37 Harley Street you will be moving either to Harley Place or York Gate.

 

This has been a disaster for me as I paid you £400 for the year for the virtual office which it seems you cannot provide.

 

I have had to re-route as much of my post as I can for a third time having routed it first to 29 Harley street then to 37 Harley street on your instructions and now having to re-route it again.

 

If you are not establishing  a new permanent  office in the area then it is only right that you should say so  and in that event you should refund me as you cannot provide the service you charged for.

 

Please respond to me and let me know urgently what the situation is.

 

Regards

 

Anthony

Dear Customer, , 

Formations House is moving!

The long-term lease on our current offices has come up for renewal and we have used this opportunity to move to a more modern better suited office building.

Currently we have 3 rooms of a single floor in a period building on Harley Street. As some of you may be aware we occasionally have power failures, internet connectivity issues and visitors have very little space to wait when collecting mail and other enquiries. Moving forward we wanted to give our visitors a fresh and modern experience whenever they come to meet us.

Our new building will be on Harley Place, a mere 150 feet from our existing building however we will have the entire building at our disposal for hospitality. The new office is very modern, has excellent connectivity and offers visitors space to sit, take refreshments and have formal or informal meetings with us at any time in the working day.

Our new office however is being refurbished to our standard and won't be ready until the 18th August. Between July 10th and August 18th, we will be unable to meet any customers at our current offices.

Customers who attend our offices regularly to collect mail will be asked if they prefer their mail forwarded at no additional cost to them (this is only for customers on hold who usually collect), or to collect their mail as usual but at a prearrange time and date at a temporary location next door on Harley Street.

All Registered Address subscribers:
We will move all registered addresses at Companies House to our new address without charge to the customer.


Postal and Service address customers:
For HMRC where we act as accountants, we will arrange the update of the address. For all other customers using 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR to receive non-government mail such as bank correspondence and customer communications you will need to change the address provided to: c/o AC Online, 37 Harley Street, London, W1G 8QG


Customers whose address related services have expired more than 3 months ago will not be transferred automatically. Any mail items (government or otherwise) will not be stored/ scanned/ forwarded or otherwise available.

Customers who regularly book meeting rooms will be unable to do so from now on, however we can recommend other providers if necessary.

From everyone at Formations House we thank you for your continued support and we look forward to seeing you at our new modern offices in the coming weeks.
