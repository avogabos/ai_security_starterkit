You have not been the director at Companies House since:

Resigned on

Regarding HMRC we have sent them the changes however it may take a little longer to be effective.

Morning NadyaÂ
Â
I received a letter yesterday from government gateway to change VAT registration.
I'll send the code needed in a moment, but I'm still registered as a Director or ME Ltd?Â
I thought this was changed to you.
Â
ThanksÂ
