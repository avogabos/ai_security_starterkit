Ahhhh, scrap that I just looked at the scanned copy of the cheque,, it
wasn't signed!! 

Would you like to issue a new signed cheque? Or wait for the old and then
issue a new one?

 

Thanks

Hi Philip,

 

Nadya I believe may have emailed you, we received the cheque and banked it
accordingly, however the cheque did not clear, although we as yet have still
not received it back from the bank.

 

Once we receive the cheque back from the bank I will let you know what may
have been the issue - though I cant think of anything as its looked fine to
bank.

 

I shall let support know to keep the order marked paid in any case as I know
we will resolve the cheque.

 

I hope you are well otherwise

 

Kind Regards

Charlotte
