Dear Charlotte,


I couldn't find the current MOT for LN03 UCE, so I have now MOTd LN03 UCE. Please will you renew the road tax online on the new monthly scheme?


BN51 ZXC has been written off. Please declare it SORN until the insurer does the paperwork from their end.


Can you let me know that LN03 UCE has been taxed so it can be used tomorrow?


Many thanks,
Jason
