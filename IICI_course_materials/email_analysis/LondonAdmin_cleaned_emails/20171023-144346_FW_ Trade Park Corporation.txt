Dear Rachel,

 

I believe you may have to go to the Judiciary- Eastern Magistrates' Courts and pay for it and yes the original form BIR56A is with us. Do you want us to send to you?

 

Also we have stored all the old letters for your companies, may I know if you would like us to send all to you as well or destroy it? Please advise.

 

Thank you!

 

Best Regards,

Dear Rachel,

 

I can see that the Employee Return is a duplicate issued on 9 Feb 2017 (you can see as below) and that is what we have received recently.

 

We have not idea why you received so late as we only help and collect your letter and here only is your registered address.

 

So you may need to contact the IRD department and as the guy came on 20th October 2017. He mentioned it is $3000 Business Registration for this company and (Case number : ESB 3135/2017). 

 

Thank you!




 

Best Regards,
