Dear Sam

 

When you arrived we mentioned that you need to let us know when you wanted the drinks and what they might be and we would make them. Coffee is made fresh every time, we offer it free with the meeting room hire which is uncommon in most places.

 

The wifi is wireless, it was positioned nearer you than us and therefore technically you would have better access to it. Apple devices are of course infallable?

 

You are not obliged to book with us again however the invoice still stands. 

 

Please make payment.

 

Kind regards

I’d specifically asked for drinks to be offered when my guest arrived.

Having to come and ask again when my guest had arrived kind of removes the whole point

of someone serving coffee as I may as well make it myself if that’s the case.

 

There were serious issues with the internet and although it worked in your room it didn’t in mine.

 

There was nothing wrong with my device. It’s a new mac and there weren’t issues anywhere else.

Dear Sam,

 

We prepared the drinks tray ready and you mentioned you would let us know when you wanted it as you were awaiting the guests.

The internet issue we showed was down to your device and not our service as at that time not only did we put a new router in the room, we also checked that a number of us using the same wifi router could get to your website.

 

The room is a dark wood panelled room as it always has been, the nature of the room is that it can be a little dark. The room is typically cooler than most meeting spaces and this has never been raised as a comment before, as you have had previous meetings in the same room with the same heating, I cannot accept that you felt the room was significantly too cold and neither did you come and request additional heating or lighting. 

 

In terms of booking, we were given the booking and we reserved the room. We are unaware of any of your issues in booking the room. The only thing we were additionally requested was that you would have access to the room earlier, and we allowed this without charge.

While here you did not mention this problem either.

 

You are requested to settle the invoice in full. In future you should request any additional requirements and we shall let you know if we are unable to meet them. 

The building is being updated and from May 2016 the room rate will increase to £45 + VAT per hour.

 

Kind Regards

Nadya

Hi Nadya,

 

the room was cold, there was not sufficient lighting, I asked for someone to check on 

us for drinks and nothing happened, the internet was unusably slow. It took 30 minutes and 3 phone calls to book the room!!

 

Nothing was fit for purpose. The only thing that has been done effectively is sending me an invoice.

 

The service has been good in the past.

 

I will settle 50% of the invoice as a gesture of good will.

 

S
