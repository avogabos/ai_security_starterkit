Dear Madam 

Re  European Collection Services Limited - 7994588 

Having checked our records, the above company was removed from the Register,
for non compliance, of its filing requirements. 

If the above company is required on the Register, you can apply for it to be
Administratively Restored.  To proceed with this process, Companies House
will require the following documents:- 

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from
the Companies House web site www.gov.uk). 

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the
B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors -
https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 

3) Annual Return forms for the years ending  
16th March 2013, with the filing fee of £40. 
16th March 2014, with the filing fee of £40. 
16th March 2015, with the filing fee of £40. 
16th March 2016, with the filing fee of £40. 
(These forms can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk). 

4) Accounts for the period ending - 

31st March 2013. 

31st March 2014. 

31st March 2015. 

Having checked our records, as the above company was struck off the
Register, prior to filing the Accounts for 2013, no late filing penalty
would have been generated, upon its restoration. 

Yours faithfully 

Mr A. Owen. 

Restoration Department.
