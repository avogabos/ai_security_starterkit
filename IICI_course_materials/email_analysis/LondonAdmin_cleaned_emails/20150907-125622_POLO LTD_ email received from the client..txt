Summary: Re: Re: POLO LTD

 

Email From: semirkimyonok@gmail.com

 

Regarding the account transfer at RBS, could you please provide me with the
contact details of the concerned person in RBS for Polo Ltd issues.
Unfortunately there is just one general phone number for all calls from
outside UK, which makes it impossible to find anyone to talk to. I need
contact person name, email/phone/fax, any information please. Thank you.

 

 

Kind Regards,

Semir Kimyonok
