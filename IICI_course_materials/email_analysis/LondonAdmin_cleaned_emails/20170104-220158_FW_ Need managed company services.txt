Hi, 

Our company incorporated in USA as Octagroup LLC , with operational offices
in Uae and Pakistan. 

Our current business are octalogo.com and Appocta.com related to web and
mobile app development. 

We are planning to enter in online training and education market of uk. For
this we need to incorporate our company in uk and need a payment collection
service. Later I will apply for entrepreneurship visa and will come to uk
for this  establishment. 

The annual turnover of our online training program will be 30k pounds per
month and per transaction value will be avg 250-350 pounds.  

I am also CEO of a large online marketplace TradeKey.com with over 8 million
registered companies our customers around the world. 


I had uk visa which just expired 2 months before. I am Oxford graduate and a
Pakistani national.
