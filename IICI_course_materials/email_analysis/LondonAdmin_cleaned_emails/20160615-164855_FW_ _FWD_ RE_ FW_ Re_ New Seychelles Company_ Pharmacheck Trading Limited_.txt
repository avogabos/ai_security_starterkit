Dear Felix,

 

I have attached the page 5 properly filled out with signature of Catherine Strempler.

 

Again, it is her signature on the documents.

 

thank you,

Andrew

There are some following issues in the documents, please contact client:

 

 

First one is that both client signatures differs completely as from their passport copy.

Can you definitely confirm client signed them.

Second issue is that the last document in the resolution- pg 5: annual report, the client did not complete the part for specific activities-

They need to state what exactly the company is to do and geographical location
