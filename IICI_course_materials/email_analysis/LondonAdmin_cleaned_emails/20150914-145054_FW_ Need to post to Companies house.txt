HI

 

Just talk to Companies house they are saying that accounts don't have any
signature that sent by us. So send the attached accounts again after sign
the Balance sheet as soon as possible.

 

Regarding penalty they said that first send them the acceptable accounts and
then send fax or letter to them not to impose any penalty as we have sent
the accounts before the due date and for some reason we forgot to sign the
document.

 

Regards

Syed Fahad Waheed
