Dear Customer Support,

 

On 23rd June 2015 all the share and directorship have been transferred into
my name, and the registered office address has been changed. Also, I
requested you to write me a cheque and close the account at RBS.

 

Based on these changes I was going to open a new bank account, but
surprisingly the new bank informed me that I am not the shareholder, not the
director, and has no authority to open any bank account.

 

And when I've checked with the Companies House I realised that you have
reversed all the changes. Also the cheque that I have put in cashing process
has not been paid yet and the bank account at RBS is still open.

 

Now I request you to reverse all the changes that you have made IMMEDIATELY;
transfer the share and directorship back into my name, and change the
registered office address.

 

And STOP making any change ever again as you have no more authorisation on
this company anymore. What you have done is a corporatefraud, without asking
my permission you cannot make any change, and I havealready declared to you
that I have terminated all the service agreements with your company.

 

Awaiting your earliest response and action please.

 

Kind Regards,

Semir Kimyonok
