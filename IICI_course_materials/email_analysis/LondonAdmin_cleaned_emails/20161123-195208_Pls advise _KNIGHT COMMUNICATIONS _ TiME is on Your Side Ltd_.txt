Hello Charlotte, we have received the below email from FH customer who has 2
companies formed through us. He wants to come to our office for a meeting.
Pls check and advise:



KNIGHT COMMUNICATIONS

TiME is on Your Side Ltd
ID: 49611773

 

Dear Sir/MadamI would like to arrange an appointment with you. I have some
concerns regarding two companies I was appointed as a director.Please, let
me know when I can come to your office and clarify all issues. I would like
to mention that my request for meeting and everything related to it are
strictly confidential. I have some concerns and suspicions that something
illegal was done at the time I was appointed as a director and/or
shareholder. As far as the other people (directors, shareholder, or anyone
who had/has access to the formation house online account) could be involved
in the illegal actions I would like to ask you not to inform anyone about my
request, as further police investigation might be required.

 

The companies I have concerns about are "The Knight Communications" and
"Time is on your side".

 

Regards,

 

Sarah
