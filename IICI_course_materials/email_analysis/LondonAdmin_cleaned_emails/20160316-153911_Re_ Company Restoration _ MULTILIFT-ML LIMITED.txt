Dear Steve, 


thanks for your email. 

For last 3 years 2 of our uk companies were dissolved cause of managers of Formationhouse (Katya and Bernard)  accepted my orders for 
company but forgot to do anything. For example EUROLIFTER TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED and one more company, i cant remember name now. That companies were restored by dear manager Nadya for not longer then 10 days and it was free for us 
cause it wasn't our fault that time. So i know that restoration isn't so long and difficult process for sure. 
As i know avarage price is about 170-200 pounds. So of course 2600 pounds for restoration 
of the company that was dissolved only for Annual return 6 month ago can't be acceptable. 
Epecially i was very surprised to get such price from Formationhouse after our 8 years of cooperation. 

Client will do restoration himself. He needs it as soon as possible. 
After company will be active, i will order certificate of good-standing 
and thanks for reminding about annul accounts till May. 

Please could you be so kind to send me 
Authentication code
Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)

It would be great if you can send me it today. 
Client is waiting (((  

W ith Best Regards, Ekaterina Churilova
