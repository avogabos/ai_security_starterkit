Dear Charlotte,

 

Hope you are in good health and I could see you at the office by the end of this week as I am travelling to London.

 

The time has come to look at outstanding business with formation of our Company ALTENAR LIMITED.

 

A bank account for the company has not open jet and now it is required. We are in negotiations with two banks and need your help with the documentation.

 

Please obtain for us copies with Apostille of the following documents:

 

1.     Certificate of Incorporation

2.     Memorandum and articles of association

3.     Incumbency certificate

4.      

Please do 2 sets of the documents, as we will present them into to separate places

 

My kind regards and best wishes,

 

 

Valeri

Dear Charlotte,

 

I have just had a call with Promsvyaz Bank about the urgency to open an Account. 

 

They still have not received my Bank reference from you. As you send it on 12/09/2014, it has to be with the Bank by now. It is the last Document, Bank requires and it is the Showstopper now.  Please supply us with the Tracking Number.

 

Thanks a lot for your service

 

Best regards,

 

Valeri

Dear Valeri,

 

I have checked and I have only the reference for you. I believe when we sent the FBME application off we were waiting for Stanislavs reference, I have check in our fax servers and email etc and nothing had been sent that way either.

 

Please ask Stanislav to reorder his reference, and I shall be sending out your one today to the bank

 

Thanks

Charlotte

Dear Valeri,

 

I have attached the scan of the document, please send on to the bank and also obtain the name and address of whom I should send the originals to.

 

Also check they do not need anything further as I believe everything requested in the original list is included.

 

Many Thanks

 

Charlotte
