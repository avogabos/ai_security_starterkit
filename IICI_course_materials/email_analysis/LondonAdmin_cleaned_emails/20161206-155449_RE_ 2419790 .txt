Hi Nadya,

Unfortunately no it is switched off. They will be trying again with this
contact number as it is the only one they have, however it would be easier
for them with more contact information they have more chance of getting hold
of someone and getting this shipment delivered.

Many Thanks

 

Kind Regards
