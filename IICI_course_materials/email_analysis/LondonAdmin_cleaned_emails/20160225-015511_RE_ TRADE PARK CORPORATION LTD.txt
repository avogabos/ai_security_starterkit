Dear Rachel,

As my email to Nadya yesterday.  NSC1 may not accepted by CR for some reason and returned to the registered address with a cover letter explain why.  Please check with Nova Business Centre (registered address) to see if they receive the returned NSC1.  If you need further assistance on this issue, I could  refer this to Angela, the Director of our Company Secretary Department.

Thanks,
Nelly

Hi,

Thank you for your email.

Please advise if we should resubmit the form NSC1 online by ourselves as this is really urgent matter now.

Best Regards,

Dear Nadya,

I filed NSC1 on 5 Feb 2016 and also confirmed Company Registry ("CR") listed document with the status "pending".

I just called Angela of our company secretary department.  She told me that only reason was that the NSC1 may not accepted by CR for some reason and returned to the registered address with a cover letter explain why.

If you need further assistance on this issue, I could also refer this to Angela.

I await hearing from you.

Regards,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

We received the documents, thank you.

However, is there any reason we cannot see the filing of the NSC1 The Return of Allotment on the Companies Registry online?

I do believe you filed it there on the 5th February 2016?

Kind regards
Nadya
