First Director: KOMENDANT

In the Bank letter the address states that he lives in Apt. 17 but in the
email below it states Apt. 13 please get him to confirm

 

For EVSTRATENKO

It does not show the full address and the town is showing as MURMANSKAYA on
the driver's license and it states Moscow in your email below 

 

Surname: KOLOMYTSEVA

Driver's license doesn't show full address 

 

If they could provide a utility bill that would be great! The driver's
licenses in Russia don't seem to show full address 

 

Passports are fine
