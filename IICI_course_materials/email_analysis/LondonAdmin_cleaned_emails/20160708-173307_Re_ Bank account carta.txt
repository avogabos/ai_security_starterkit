Dear Marc,
I managed to get through to Edric who is dealing with the change of mandate, however he has still not received it!!!
The guy who took your ID on the 21 June at the Cavendish square branch said that he clearly addressed it to Edric Mumbonye. Apparently they are supposed to keep a copy at their Cavendish square branch but because of the refurbishment he cannot seem to find it as it has been moved. I am livid.
I will be going back to the branch this afternoon for them to look for it until they find it and fax it straight to Edric.
Kind regards
Nadya
