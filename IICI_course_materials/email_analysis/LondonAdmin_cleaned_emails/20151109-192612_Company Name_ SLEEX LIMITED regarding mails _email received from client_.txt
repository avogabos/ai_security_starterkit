We just spoke on the phone and I was told that no post arrived for me today
or yesterday.

 

 I have just spoken to the sender of the package that I am expecting. 

 

 An envelope was delivered to your address, 29 Harley Street, yesterday.

 

It was sent by UPS, with the tracking number 1ZW19V590494450927 and it has
been signed by a person called Maria.

 

Could you please check again and forward it to me like every post you
forward.

Could you also confirm that you have found it.

 

Thank you in advance.

 

 Kind regards

 

Corinna
