Hi Billy, 

 

Thank you for your email. Happy 2017 to you too!

 

Firstly Fairway Carlyle Corp has expired since October 2015. So you will
have to renew and there may possibly also be late filling government fees
unfortunately. 

We have just emailed our Seychelles agents for a quote.

 

For the requested documents much of this will be issued by Seychelles so we
have also requested a quote:

 

1.	You will need to create this
2.	We will obtain quote as a renewal is due too first
3.	We will again need to get a quote

 

Due to the difference in working hours we will not hear from them until
tomorrow as they are 4 hours ahead of us. 

 

Secondly we require updated ID for the directors and shareholders. 

 

1.	Certified copy of Passport or Drivers Licence
2.	Certified Proof of address no older than 3 months. Utility bill/Bank
statement

 

So perhaps in the meantime please kindly organise this. 

 

As soon as we hear from them I will contact you. It will probably take about
2/3 working days to get this done. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
