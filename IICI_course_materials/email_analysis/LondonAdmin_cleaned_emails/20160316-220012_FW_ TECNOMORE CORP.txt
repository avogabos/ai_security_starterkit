Hi nadya,

The above client informed us that he has paid Tahir for accounting Service.

There is an order on accounts admin but it is unpaid (ORD Number: 185703).

So can you please check and confirm if we have any payment from this client
or not.

Thank you

Dear Felix,
we have received a letter from the Companies House regarding the above
company.
I think that I have already ordered to Tahir to prepare the dormant account
last year.
Can you please check it for me and let me know about which fees I have to
pay.
I would like to pay the dormant company account, the annual tax return
Govnerment fillig fee and the other fees in one solution. Kindly  let me
know.

Best regards,

Dott. Aldo Zezza
