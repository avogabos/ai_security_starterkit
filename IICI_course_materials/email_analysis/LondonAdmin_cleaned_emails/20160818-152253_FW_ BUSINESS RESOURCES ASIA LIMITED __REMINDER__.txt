Hi Charlotte, this customer has provided passport copy which is attached and a utility bill. He will provide the translated copy of the bill in English. But he doesn’t not have personal bank statement as Japanese banks do not provide it in English.

 

Could u pls advise.

 

Thanks

Dear Sarah,

 

He does not have a bank account in foreign countries and Japanese banks do not issue them as I told you before. As we asked you once, please tell us the alternative document for it.

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,

Asami Yamada
