Hi

 

Re: SHABANDAR LLP

 

As discussed this llp has 2 partners and I have been unable to obtain the
UTR NOS for both.

 

The 2 partners are Seychelles companies- Shy pearl Ltd & Green Sheep Ltd.
The Beneficial owner of this company is Waris khan His UTR is above.

 

SA402 has been sent twice without any response, could you call them and get
the numbers.

 

This has become critical as we can't file a tax return with HRMC. 

 

Any questions just ask?

 

Thanks, Tahir
