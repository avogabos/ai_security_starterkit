Also, you should have received a PIN code for the card as the attached document shows. Also, our client is looking for another PIN code for the card reader (When they insert the card to the card reader, they need to put their PIN). There were no letters which state about PIN code.

Dear
Sarah,
As
we put the company name, the error occurs and a message shows up as 'Sorry! the
company name already exist. Please try with different Company Name.'. We cannot
make the payment for the service.
Also,
you should have received a PIN code for the card as the attached document
shows. Also, our client is looking for another PIN code for the card reader
(When they insert the card to the card reader, they need to put their PIN).
There were no letters which state about PIN code.
You
should have received some letters for these.
We
look forward to hearing from you.
