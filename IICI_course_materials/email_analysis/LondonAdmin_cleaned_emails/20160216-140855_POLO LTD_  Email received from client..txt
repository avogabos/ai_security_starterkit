Hello Nadya,

 

Please check below email received from the client and kindly advice. Thank

Hello,

 

 

Based on the below correspondence, RBS has just informed me that they have
not received any instructions from Ms. Pawar with regards to changing
signatory authority, and they are currently waiting for this to proceed.

 

 

Please check and inform me with the situation, and if there is anything
needed from my side, advise please.

 

 

Also, there is an expected incoming payment around USD 25,000, due Feb 2016.
I need USD account details please to take this transfer, as I have not been
provided earlier.

 

 

Thank you,

Semir Kimyonok
