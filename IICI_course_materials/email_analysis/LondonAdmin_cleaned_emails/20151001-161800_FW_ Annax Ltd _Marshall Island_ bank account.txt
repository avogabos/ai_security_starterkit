Dear Charlotte,

 

Please find attached all the documents as per your request for the nominee
Jan Snyman and the POA Aaron Archer, could you confirm that this will
suffice to open up the euro pacific bank account.

 

Please know what further you require as soon as possible and i will endeavor
to submit it to you promptly.

 

Regards

 

Jonathan Arafiena
