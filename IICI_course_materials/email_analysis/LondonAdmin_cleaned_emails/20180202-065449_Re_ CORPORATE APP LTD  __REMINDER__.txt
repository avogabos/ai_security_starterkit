Dear Sarah,
Please reply my email.
Can you please make the test payment?
Can you advise who remitted the last payment to the company’s account? Kindly provide the sender as well every time.
Can you please provide a contact for the client to liaise for your managed company service?
I also need a phone number of your office so I can call when you don’t reply emails.
Thank you very much!
