Hi Nadya,

Re: INTERPATH LTD

Termination of Nadyezhda Crawford as a director on 29 June 2016 has been
DONE. Please confirm if Nadyezhda Crawford will also be terminated as PSC
and will it be back dated as well?

And 1 Share has been transferred to Andrew Peter Clark who is now holding
101 Shares. Should I submit Confirmation Statement to update the information
at Companies House?

Looking forward to hear from you.

Best Regards,

Shawn Alfanso
