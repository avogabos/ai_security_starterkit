Hi Wade,
We have requested information so just waiting for them to come back. In the meantime they have sent us the attached document. Not sure if this is what you need?

Hi Nadya
Unfortunately compliance will require more specific information in the partner form, about the partner and the relationship - a few sentences please, also can the client provide a agreement?
