CC: Wellensiek <jan.wellensiek@salesbuzzter.com>

To whom it may concern,

On Friday, my colleague, Jan Wellensiek, and I requested the VAT
registration to be done for our company, Salesbuzzter, through Formations
House. However, we have not received a confirmation as to when we can
expect our VAT number.

Would you be able to provide us with further information on the process for
the VAT and when we will receive it? Please find the receipt for the
service attached.

Best regards,

Pamela Salinas
