Dear Fabian, Mark,

Please see attached recent statement.

May I ask what the status is with transferring this account?

It seems that I am still on the account and the account is now in the minus. There is a monthly account maintenance fee of 5 GBP. Please ensure there is at least 100GBP in there to maintain it otherwise it will be closed.

Please kindly remove me from the account. I believe they emailed you the form where you need to remove me and sign it.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
