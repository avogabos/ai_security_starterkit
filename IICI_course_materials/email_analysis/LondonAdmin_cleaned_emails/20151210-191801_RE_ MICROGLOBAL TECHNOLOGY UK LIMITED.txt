Hi Michael

Please confirm the YOUR understanding and acceptance of the below changes to
the capacity of your future EPB bank account via responding to this email.
After receiving confirmation bank will gladly continue the application
process.

Due to recent changes in settlement instructions, Euro Pacific Bank will no
longer be offering USD incoming wires for corporate clients. As such, in the
near term the Bank will be focusing on non-USD currencies, which include
EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, JPY, CHF, PLN and CAD. 

Regards

Steve
