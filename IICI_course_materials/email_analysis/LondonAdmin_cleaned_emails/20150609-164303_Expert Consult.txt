Dear Sirs / Nadya

Re: Expert Consult - virtual office account, Ref:698736

Please note that the above service has not been renewed since the expiry of the last period covered, and we do not envisage to take advantage of this in near future.

However, acting in confusion, a client of ours, Georgi Nishkov happened to send an envelope with documents  by special delivery under referenced AE901914389GB, by mistake to your address:

Expert Consult
29 Harley Street
London
W1G 9QR.

I understand that the client is with you now in person demanding the collection of this envelope.

Please kindly release this envelope as it was not meant to be sent to you in the first place, and I confirm hereby that I have no objections to and agree with your such actions.

I apologise for any inconvenience that this may have caused.

Please feel free to contact me on 07894470110 in case you need further confirmation to this matter.

Yours sincerely,
On behalf of Expert Consult


Dimitrar Dimitrov Kichukov
