    Subject Line Best Practices   
 When you submit a completed account pre-approval form   
 use the following format in the Subject Line of the email:      
    Pre-Approval - {Account Name} - {Agent Name}      
         
         
     
Begin the Subject Line with Pre-Approval as this informs the Account Manager that a new application is being introduced.   
  
Next, replace {Account Name} with the actual account name. For a corporate account, this would be the name of the company.   
  
The final part of the Subject Line is to replace {Agent Name} with your name or the name of your company.
