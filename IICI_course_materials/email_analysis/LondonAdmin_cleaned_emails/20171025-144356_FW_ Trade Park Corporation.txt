Dear Rachel,

 

I can see that the Employee Return is a duplicate issued on 9 Feb 2017 (you can see as below) and that is what we have received recently.

 

We have not idea why you received so late as we only help and collect your letter and here only is your registered address.

 

So you may need to contact the IRD department and as the guy came on 20th October 2017. He mentioned it is $3000 Business Registration for this company and (Case number : ESB 3135/2017). 

 

Thank you!

Dear Rachel,

 

I can see that the Employee Return is a duplicate issued on 9 Feb 2017 (you can see as below) and that is what we have received recently.

 

We have not idea why you received so late as we only help and collect your letter and here only is your registered address.

 

So you may need to contact the IRD department and as the guy came on 20th October 2017. He mentioned it is $3000 Business Registration for this company and (Case number : ESB 3135/2017). 

 

Thank you!




 

Best Regards,

Hi Diva,

 

Could you please advise why are we receiving these letters so late, as in the ones issued back in 2016? Why are we getting them now? i can see we have not received these before from you

 

Please also advise what we have to do now? Do we have to go to the court and how much is the fine?

 

Also send us the orignal BIR56A form for Trade Park Corporation

pay for it and yes the original form BIR56A is with us. Do you want us to send

Re: Trade Park Corporation
Dear Rachel,
I believe you may have to go to the
Judiciary- Eastern Magistrates' Courts and pay for it and
yes the original form BIR56A is with us. Do you want us to send to you?
Also we have stored all
the old letters for your companies, may I know if you would like us to send all
to you as well or destroy it? Please advise.
Thank you!
Best
Regards,
Diva

Re: Trade Park Corporation
Dear Rachel,
I can see that the Employee Return is a
duplicate issued on 9 Feb 2017 (you can see as below) and that is what we have
received recently.
We have not idea why you received so
late as we only help and collect your letter and here only is your registered
address.
So you may need to contact the IRD
department and as the guy came on 20th October 2017. He mentioned it is
$3000 Business Registration for this company and (Case
number : ESB 3135/2017).
Thank you!
Best
Regards,
Diva

Hi
Diva,
Could
you please advise why are we receiving these letters so late, as in the ones
issued back in 2016? Why are we getting them now? i can see we have not
received these before from you
Please
also advise what we have to do now? Do we have to go to the court and how much
is the fine?
Also
send us the orignal BIR56A form for Trade Park Corporation
