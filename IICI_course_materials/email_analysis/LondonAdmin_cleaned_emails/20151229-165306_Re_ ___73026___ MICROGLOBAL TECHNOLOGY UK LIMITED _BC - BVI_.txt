Dear Nadya,

I am afraid I didn't receive your confirmation. In that case, please amend the Bank Contract with Yan Cui signing solely, and leave Chuntao in the UBO information box, page 5.


Thank you.

Hi Nadya,
Due to recent changes in our settlement instructions, Euro Pacific Bank will
no longer be offering USD
incoming wires
for corporate clients. As such, in the near term the Bank will be focusing on our non-USD currencies, which include
EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, JPY, CHF, PLN and CAD
.
This
does not
impact your use of:
1. USD outgoing wires
2. USD bank cards
3. USD currency conversions
4. USD deposit accounts
5. USD investments
To compensate new clients for this in inconvenience we are offering a
free currency conversion program
if you would still like to have your non-USD wires credited in USD:
https://europacbank.com/support/free-currency-conversions-usdfx0/
.
Please confirm the client's understanding and acceptance of the above changes to the capacity of his future EPB bank account via responding to this email. After receiving confirmation we will gladly continue the application process.
Best regards,
Hui Lun Shih (Cathy)

Hi Hui,
From client:
We reviewed the contract is ok to process and please see the
re-signed Corporate Resolution file attached.
Regarding to the USD wire topic, could you confirm which
currency will be accepted by EPB? E.g. GBP, EUR or others?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya

Hi Nadya,
Thank you for the documents.
There was only Ms. Cui's signature on the Bank Contract needs to be re-signed because her signature on the passport is in Chinese. Mr. Liang's signature on the passport is in English. I amended the Bank Contract regarding the signatures and attached, can you confirm with the clients?
Mr. Liang will need to re-sign the Corporate Resolution in English so the compliance can verify the signature with his passport.
I will be waiting for the Memorandum copies.
Please also inform the clients regarding the recent change of the bank:
Effective immediately, after persevering through a number of compliance challenges associated to receiving USD payments, Euro Pacific Bank has decided to
stop accepting USD incoming wire transfers from
third parties.
How will this affect wiring with my future Euro Pacific Bank account?
Receiving wires:
New accounts will not be able to receive USD wires from external, third parties (friends, business partners, suppliers, etc). Through the bank account you will however be able to RECEIVE wires from your own USD personal accounts at other institutions (banks, brokerage, etc).
Sending wires:
Outgoing wires in USD will still be processed by the bank account, and you will be able to send wires to suppliers, employees and other associates.
Best regards,
Hui Lun Shih (Cathy)
