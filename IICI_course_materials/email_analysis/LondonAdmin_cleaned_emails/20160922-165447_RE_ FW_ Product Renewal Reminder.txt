Hi Philip 

Nadya passed this query on to me, for the past few days our email server has been experiencing issues due to our internet provider Exponential E creating a few issues, the issue should be resolved by the end of the week. However this should only effect webmail – you can always access your email via outlook by inputting the corresponding email with the correct pop & smtp settings. 

You need to use smtp.barbicancorporatefinance.co.uk & for downloading email you need to use pop. barbicancorporatefinance.co.uk in the email setting

If there’s any further technical issues please do let me know, Sorry for any inconvenience we’re attempting to resolve it with our ISP asap. 

Regards
