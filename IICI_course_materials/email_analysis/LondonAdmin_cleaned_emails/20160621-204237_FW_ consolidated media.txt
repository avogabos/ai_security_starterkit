Can the Director come on Thursday afternoon (please confirm exact time) to our office.

 

Ms. Nadya will accompany him to the bank for bank mandate change

 

He needs to bring a recent utility bill (proof of address), a recent bank statement and his passport. 

 

Please confirm 

 

Best regards

 

Oliver
