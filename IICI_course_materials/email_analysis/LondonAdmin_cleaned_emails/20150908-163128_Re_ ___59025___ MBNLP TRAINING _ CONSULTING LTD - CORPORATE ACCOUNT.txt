Hi Nadya,


Some documents are not complete I saw just now.


The Memorandum & Articles of Association is missing mostly all the pages.
The company name on the Corporate Resolution in incomplete.The Bank Contract is incomplete (page 5, UBO info.)


So could you resend the following documents:


7. Notarized Copy of Memorandum & Articles of Association/Incorporation OR Articles of Incorporation & Bylaws
9. Corporate Resolution authorizing the account opening with Euro Pacific Bank (sample at https://europacbank.com/registration/)


A provide more details on page 5 for the Bank contract.


10. Corporate Bank Contract and Source of Funds: https://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_contract_corporate.pdf


Best,
Jaap Lodder

If you see the letter from the Bank, UniCredit, confirming his address and Identity details which are attached on pages 3 and 4.
I have also attached a copy of a recent bank statement.
Please let me know if this is sufficient.
