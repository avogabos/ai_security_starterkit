Dear Nadia,

Thank you for your email and your kind feedback.

I have just double checked the details you provided with our accounts that will have to deal with the handover of the company.

Could you please provide the UTR number as well?

Reviewing the financial statement that has been files to CH we found out that the profit and loss accounts  are not included and we would need to receive a copy as well.

Moreover considering that the Company has been incorporated on the 28th February 2012 we would need to receive all the accounting documents (invoices issued and received, expenses, bank statement...) from the incorporation date (unless this documentation has been already provided to the client).

Could please verify with your accounting Team and provide the following list of document?


  *   Asset book/list YTD;
  *   Previous Tax Return;
  *   Profit and loss account;
  *   All the Statutory books of the company: including register of members and minute books;
  *   Inventory;
  *   List of clients/suppliers "opened"
  *   Lease agreements and mortgage agreements where existing;
  *   Invoices issued and received;
  *   Receipts for expenses;
  *   Trial balance.

Please note that in case this  documentation has been held  by an external consultant, I would be more than happy to receive the contact details in order to require what above.

Thank you for your kind cooperation.

I look forward to hearing from you and I wish you a nice rest of the day.

Kind Regards,

Valentina

Dear Valentina,

The authentication code is WG389P

All previously filed accounts are shown on Companies House website. The CT600 returns I have requested from our accounting team and these will be sent on later this week. However please note you will be able to see from the filed account the value of the CT.

The orders were placed by an agent of Formations House, Adam Khan. He is no longer associated with Formations House. Invoices in our system for previous orders have been generated for Adam Khan and will not reflect the price your client may have paid.

We have no other documentation to provide as the services we supplied for this business were limited.

We are happy to help with any other requirements you have in the future,
Kind Regards

Nadya.
