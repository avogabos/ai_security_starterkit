*Hi Nadya,*

many thanks for your help.

EPB has closed my online banking yesterday (Mr Ashe Whitener is a crazy
man!); I'm looking what to do to solve the problem.

At the moment, I come back to London late afternoon on 26 August.

See you,
Stefano

Hi Nadya,
I sent the below email to Charlotte.
It's not a problem about a new Business Bank Account at EPB.
I asked EPB to receive a big sum of "Consultancy Fees" in the
EPB Account I opened in 2013 as Dottori Commercialisti Londra Ltd (Gambia Company) and it's still working; for this reason, I sent EPB Head Business Manager (Mr Ashe Whitener) a copy of the "DOA Agreements were signed few days ago.
Dottori Commercialisti Londra Ltd (Gambia Company) is going to receive some international bank transfers to Its EPB Account, but EPB manager said EPB doesn't like to do it.
I think it would be better if Charlotte or Sam speaks and understand the position of EPB to about.
As I wrote to Charlotte, it's a very big problem for me, because I can't change now the bank details on 2 DOA
and the customer bank is sending the first consultancy fees.
I'm ready to fly to EPB Head Office in SVG (also with Charlotte or Sam) to explain the contents of the 2 DOA Agreements.
1 DOA Agreement regards a consultancy fee of â‚¬800k; the second DOA Agreement is much bigger and the consultancy commissions will be payed in 11 tranches.
The 2 DOA are lawful and in accordance with law.
If the consultancy commissions won't be transfered to Dottori Commercialisti Londra Ltd EPB
account, we'll lose them; probably, it would be useful speak with a member of the EPB Board.
Tell me where I can send you a copy of the 2 DOA Agreements?
Thanks,
Stefano

Hi Charlotte,
I need your help with EPB, because I have (with other consultants) to get some important consultancy fees coming from 2 DOA Agreements signed in last few days.
I sent the 2 DOA Agreements to EPB, but Mr Ashe Withener (Head Business Consultant) yesterday wrote me this email:
