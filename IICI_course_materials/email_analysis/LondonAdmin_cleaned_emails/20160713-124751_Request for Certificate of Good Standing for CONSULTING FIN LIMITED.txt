Subject: Request for Certificate of Good Standing for CONSULTING FIN LIMITED
From: "Shawn Alfanso" <shawn@formationshouse.com>
To: "'nadya crawford'" <londonadmin@formationshouse.com>

Good Morning Nadya,

 

I have made a request for Certificate of Good Standing for CONSULTING FIN
LIMITED. You may receive the certificate shortly.

 

This client has also ordered Apostile. So meanwhile Sarah is sending an
email to client to confirm whether certificate has to be apostilled and also
to confirm the address to post these documents.

 

Thank you
