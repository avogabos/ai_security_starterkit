Hi Nadya

I will send you a copy of my Passport next week.

The Companies are:

Hyphen Investment Co Ltd

Episode Fashions Ltd

Site Acquisitions and Searches Ltd

Debmill Ltd

S Braun & Co

Everything else should have the name "TRUP" somewhere in the addressee.

I will collect any mail once or twice a week.

I will make the transfer at the start of the service on 20th June.

Thanks

Kind Regards

Anthony

Hi Anthony, 

As per our telephone conversation earlier, please could you kindly see
attached invoice.

Please confirm all the "non-Trup" company names so that I can make the mail
team aware.

When you are making the payment please quote reference TRUP1020 and please
do let me know once this is done so we can create an account for you. 

Please also provide a copy of your passport. 


Kind regards
Nadya Crawford

Hi Anthony,

No it doesn't work like that, if you go for the 3 months package it costs
75GBP plus a 50 set up fee per company - 125GBP as standard for one company.
Seeing as we are receiving several different names there will be a slight
increase. Therefor you will be charged 150GBP.


Kind regards
Nadya

Hi Anthony,

Yes that's fine we will charge you 150GBP for the first 3 months.

Please confirm that the name we will set you up will be "TRUP LIMITED" and
then I can set you up on our system. I will then notify the mail department
to take anything with that name in it.

Please also provide a drivers licence or copy of passport. 

Kind regards
Nadya

Hi Nadya

Would you mind if I see how things go initially and pay for 3 months to
begin with and if everything goes fine then I will pay for the rest of the
year.

Is that Ok with you?

Kind Regards

Anthony
