Dear Vincent,

We had discussed this client a few months ago. They are intending to use your share management platform in the future.

Please find attached certified ID for DIMITROVA, Biserka, the pre-approval form and certified company docs for the BVI company WILDWOOD LIMTIED.

The corporate forms I will send in another email along with the ID of the second Director DIMIROV, Dimitar.


Kind regards

Nadya
