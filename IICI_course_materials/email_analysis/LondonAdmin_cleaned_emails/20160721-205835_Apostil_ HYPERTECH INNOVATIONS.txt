Dear Sir/Madam,I have not received the apostile ordered in the above
mentioned order. It was supposed to be an apostile express and that's the
reason I paid this amount of money. Please advice :a) when  I will receive
the apostile.b) When I will receive a refund for the apostile not being
delivered on time..Waiting for your responseBR
