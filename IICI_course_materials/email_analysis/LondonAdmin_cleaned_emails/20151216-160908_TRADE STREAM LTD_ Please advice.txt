Hello Nadya,

 

Company Name: TRADE STREAM LTD

 

The above client is stating that on 10 October 2015 (Saturday) he purchased
our InfiniOffice Mail Only Service 3 month and he paid in cash at our
office.

 

However we have checked and there is no order for the service in our system
and neither we received any confirmation to place any order.

 

For the reference he has provided us the attached invoice. Can you please
check and advice?

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

 

Thank you
