Dear Sarah,

 

We would like to check that the customer number is 01(DD) 08(MM) 78(YY) + 0268? The birth date of Mr Mochizuki is 1st of August, 1978. We are not sure about the year. We need to take out 19 before 78? There should be 10 digits in all.

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,

Dear Sarah,

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to our client, the bank requires the notarized

copy of passport, utility bill, and bank statement but he has submitted the

original documents to bank already. What is happening to the bank? Can you

confirm about this and solve the problem? We are still not able to use the

account it has been 5 months since we ordered it.

 

 

 

Our client is exhausted because there have been so many

problems on this.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

Re: RBS FORMS: BUSINESS RESOURCES ASIA LIMITED
Dear
Sarah,
According
to our client, the bank requires the notarized
copy of passport, utility bill, and bank statement but he has submitted the
original documents to bank already. What is happening to the bank? Can you
confirm about this and solve the problem? We are still not able to use the
account it has been 5 months since we ordered it.
Our
client is exhausted because there have been so many
problems on this.
We
look forward to hearing from you.

How
