Hello Charlotte, 

 

Re: Hong Kong Company Trade Park Corporation Limited

We have filed annual returns for the year 2015 and change of address has
also been filed.

We will now file returns for the year 2016

 

Re: Hong Kong Company Infini Developments Limited.

This company is not registered online and no order is available on admin
report as well.

We need details to file annual returns for the year 2015 and 2016 and this
will be submitted to HK by post along with change of address.

Please advise if you have details of company registration so that we may
fill in the annual returns form and then post them to HK registry

 

Thank You
