Hi Nadya,
Thank you! Would you be able to assist me with two of the documents? I believe that I'll receive some pushback from our compliance team on the passport and utility bill.
Passport
Can you send a high resolution copy that I can include with the certified copy? The resolution of the certified copy is a bit low making the photo not easily visible.
Utility Bill
The utility bill provided does not appear to be certified. Do you have
a certified copy of the bill that can be sent over?
Thanks again, Nadya.
