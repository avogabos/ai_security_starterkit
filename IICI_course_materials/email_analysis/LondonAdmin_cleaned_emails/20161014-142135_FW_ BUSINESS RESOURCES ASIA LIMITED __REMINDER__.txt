Dear Sarah,

 

Can you please tell us how to obtain the visit visa?

 

 

The business activity will remain the same. That is consultancy services for UK businesses wishing to make trade links and outsourcing partners in Asia. 

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note that a UK Visa is required for all non EU citizens; ideally a business one. He will need to obtain a visit visa.

 

Also, please note that we need the details of the actual business and their client as our company secretary is appointed in the company to facilitate the bank transfer.

 

The document list below is correct.

Dear Sarah,

 

Thank you for your reply. 

 

No VISA will be issued for a stay within 6 months for Japanese people so it is definitely impossible to obtain it for him. He works in Japan now although he graduated a college in UK. He can communicate in English.

 

As we told before, the business activity will remain the same.

 

For our confirmation, please see the following documents which he will bring to UK;

 

1. Original Passport

2. Original Bank statement with certified translation

3. Original Certificate of Bank Balance in English

4. Original utility bill with certified translation

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please advise if your client has a Visit visa to UK and for how long will it be valid. Also note that we have appointed our own company secretary in the readymade company; she will be with the director in Bank Meeting to facilitate him. 

 

The director will be required to visit our office first. Please advise if he can communicate in English as he will have to fill in and sign some forms. Also provide us some details about the actual business activity & also where will their clients be from?

 

Our secretary will be  terminated when the account is transferred to the director successfully.

 

You do not need to get the documents notarized as they have original bank statement and utility bill along with English Translation from a professional translator. Also the bank certificate is original.

 

It is not necessary to bring Driving License.

 

We look forward to hear from you.

Dear Sarah,

 

The signature on the certificate of bank balance is the one of bank manager.

Should we have it notarized? Can you bring all the documents which we submitted to you to the bank tomorrow and confirm if they are fine again? Also we will need to tell the bank about the Business VISA which we cannot prepare for.

Please let us know f it is necessary to bring the driver's license.

We really need to make all this possible haste.

Dear Sarah,

 

 

You knew that he is just the officer of the company and you never told us that the director should live in UK. If you still require it, the readymade company needs to issue the card to Mr Mochizuki. Can you do that for us? What you told us was it is necessary to bring his original passport along with his driver's license. It is definitely impossible to obtain Business VISA for international client. We have visited UK to open a bank account there but never asked to bring it. Never.

 

Also, we have already sent you his Certificate of Bank Balance. Please find it attached.

 

You ignored to our questions twice so we understood that there is no need to notarize the documents.

 

Our client has claimed this slow work. We need to tell our client what is needed tomorrow so please reply us today.

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

In regards to the business VISA, Mr Shibata never brought his VISA to UK. He never obtains it. Please confirm as soon as possible.

 

Regarding the Certificate of Bank Balance, your colleague brought his certificate and the bank accepted it. There should be no problem with it..

Please note that a valid 6 months business visa is compulsory for all bank dealings in UK & the same has always been advised to all our clients. I have corresponded with Mr shibata in the past regarding bank account opening and bank transfer and he was advised the same when he visited us to transfer the LLYODS BANK account. Kindly advise the same to your client.

 

Regarding documents, my colleague who went to Bank has advised that the documents seems fine. The Certificate of Bank Balance is certified by the bank? Normally the bank manager who issues such certificate sign and stamp the letter.

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note that the director will be required to hand over the documents to the bank officer at the bank meeting and he will review and will then forwarded to the due diligence team for approval by fax/post. them. We cannot email the documents to the bank now as this is not the general practice here in UK. As I advised, the documents have been reviewed by our due diligence team.

 

Bank Account is normally transferred without any hassle if the proper due diligence documents(listed below) are duly provided. 

 

-Original Signed Passport (with Valid Business Visa)

-Driving License(If possible; as it will be a plus point)

-Original Bank Statement + Certified English Translation of the statement

*You can also bring the Bank Certificate that is issued in English

-Original Utility bill + Certified translati0on of the bill 

 

 Also, as I advised they can bring additional id documents. Therefore, if possible we would strongly suggest in retrieving the Mongolia Bank statement.

 

The RBS documents list is also attached for your reference.

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

If these documents are not acceptable, he actually has a bank account in Mongolia but visiting the bank is the only way to order the bank reference letter. Is it faster if he visits there and obtain his bank reference letter?

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please find attached the 1st Page of Translation Certificate which has the incorrect spelling of the word SAVINGS on it. Kindly correct it. Also, it will have to be Notarized.

 

*Director will have to bring his original passport to the bank.

 

Also, the details of the ledger on the last page is very small and it will not be in readable format when printed on paper. The table and details should be bigger & clearer.

 

Moreover, please advise if their bank can provide any document in English & has bank logo on It and can prove that they have an account with the bank.

 

Kindly also be advised that the documents are being reviewed by Formations House due diligence team; the directors will be required to submit the documents to the bank directly when they will visit London for the bank meeting.

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,

Dear Sarah,

 

Please find the translation of the account statement attached.

 

 

So we need to ask our client to have the copies of his passport and utility bill notarized only?

 

As we confirmed regarding the bank logo on bank certificate, in Japan, companies do not put its logo (trademark) on the official statement in common. Please tell over that to the bank. So he need tol prepare for the certificate of bank balance for Mitsui Sumitomo Bank as well?

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your reply.

 

Please find the translation of his account statement attached. Is there any spelling error? The title is 'Savings Ledger'.

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note that your client can bring the Bank Statement and the certified translation of the document. As advised, the original bank statements usually have bank logo on it and it is printed on the letterhead of the Bank. The director can explain it to the bank and can also provide the ‘Certificate of Bank Balance’ which will also confirm his bank account details.

 

Regarding Translation, please note that normally when a document is translated the ‘original document’ and the ‘certified translation’ is folded down together, stapled, and the seal and signature placed over it.  It is Certified by a publically-certified translator for that specific language and contain the translator’s seal and attestation confirmation. The seal must also indicate the language for which the translator is officially certified. 

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

It is certain that the account statement was the original document. There is no logo on the account statement. You may be able to call the bank at +81 (0)3 5745 5051 to confirm it and you need to tell that you are the English speaker when you call bank. Please tell the bank that it is absolutely the original document of the bank account statement Mitsui Sumitomo Bank issues.

I could not find the spelling mistake in the document. Could you please indicate where the spelling error was occurred specifically?

 

How can we bound up the documents together? There is not such culture in Japan so please teach us how to do it one by one.

 

Is it necessary to ask our client to submit the Certificate of Bank Balance?

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please be advised that the documents have been reviewed by our due diligence team; the directors will be required to submit the document to the bank directly when they will visit London for the bank meeting. 

 

Our due diligence team has advised that the Bank Statement that you have provided seems like a print only out as it does not have the logo of the Mitsui Sumitomo Bank(attached) They need to provide the original Bank statement along with the certified translation. Also, there is a spelling mistake in the certificate of translation. It says ‘Sacings Ledger’ instead of Savings. Please correct the spelling mistake in the translation

 

*Also advise your client that they can present additional documentation; such as the Certificate of Bank Balance. It should be in English and must Original on bank letter head.  Kindly email us the scanned copy of the letter.

 

The Utility bill is fine, kindly bring the ORIGINAL. Also, the original bill and the certified translation of the bill needs to be bound up together. Same is for Bank statement; the Original Bank Statement and the certified translation of the statement should be bound up together.

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

No
VISA will be issued for a stay within 6 months for Japanese people so it is
definitely impossible to obtain it for him. He works in Japan now although he
graduated a college in UK. He can communicate in English.
As

For

2.

Dear Sarah,
You knew that he is just the officer of the company and you never told us
that the director should live in UK. If you still require it, the readymade
company needs to issue the card to Mr Mochizuki. Can you do that for us? What
you told us was it is necessary to bring his original passport along with his
driver's license. It is definitely impossible to obtain Business VISA for
international client. We have visited UK to open a bank account there but never
asked to bring it. Never.
Also, we have already sent you his Certificate of Bank Balance. Please find
it attached.
You ignored to our questions twice so we understood that there is no need to
notarize the documents.
Our client has claimed this slow work. We need to tell our client what is
needed tomorrow so please reply us today.

Please

to be approved by the Compliance Department. The due diligence is approved by
the Compliance Department after the doocuments will be submitted to them by the
bank officer.
Also,
please advise the director to obtain 6 months business visa.

In regards to the business VISA, Mr Shibata never brought his VISA to UK. He

Dear

Thank
you for your email.
Please
note that a valid 6 months business visa is compulsory for all bank dealings in
UK & the same has always been advised to all our clients. I have
corresponded with Mr shibata in the past regarding bank account opening and
bank transfer and he was advised the same when he visited us to transfer the
LLYODS BANK account. Kindly advise the same to your client.
Regarding
documents, my colleague who went to Bank has advised that the documents seems
fine. The Certificate of Bank Balance is certified by the bank? Normally the
bank manager who issues such certificate sign and stamp the letter.
I
hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or

Dear Sarah,
Thank you for your reply.
So our client needs to have his bank statement and utility bill notarized,
is this correct (Not passport and certificate of bank balance)?
Is it necessary to translate his driver's license as well?
What is the comment of your due diligence team over our documents which have
been submitted to you?
We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear
Asami,
Thank
you for your email.
Please
note that the director will be required to hand over the documents to the bank
officer at the bank meeting and he will review and will then forwarded to the
due diligence team for approval by fax/post. them. We cannot email the
documents to the bank now as this is not the general practice here in UK. As I
advised, the documents have been reviewed by our due diligence team.
Bank
Account is normally transferred without any hassle if the proper due diligence
documents(listed below) are duly provided.
-Original
Signed Passport (with Valid Business Visa)
-Driving
License(If possible; as it will be a plus point)
-Original
Bank Statement + Certified English Translation of the statement
*You
can also bring the Bank Certificate that is issued in English
-Original
Utility bill + Certified translati0on of the bill
Also,
as I advised they can bring additional id documents. Therefore, if possible we
would strongly suggest in retrieving the Mongolia Bank statement.
The
RBS documents list is also attached for your reference.
I
hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or
assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
Looking
forward to hear from you.

Re: BUSINESS RESOURCES ASIA LIMITED ::REMINDER::
Dear Sarah,
Thank you for your email.
Did you send the copy of his account statement and certificate of bank
balance to the bank? We need their comments TO MAKE 100% SURE TO TRANSFER THE SIGNER
TO THE NEW DIRECTOR WHEN HE ACTUALLY TRAVELS FROM JAPAN TO UK. Otherwise, this
is just wasting time and money. If the bank judges he is not acceptable, you
need to tell that to us first to avoid his meaningless traveling to UK.
We really need your help.
We look forward to your reply.

Re: BUSINESS RESOURCES ASIA LIMITED ::REMINDER::
Dear Sarah,
Please find the amended translation of his account statement and the
certificate of bank balance attached.
We would like you to please specify the required documents clearly. Please
send us the list of all the required documents and we can prepare for them correctly.
If these documents are not acceptable, he actually has a bank account in
Mongolia but visiting the bank is the only way to order the bank reference
letter. Is it faster if he visits there and obtain his bank reference letter?
Please make all possible haste for our client.
We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your reply.
We will ask the translator to correct the word, thank you.
As we advised, certificate of bank balance is the only document which can be
issued in English and in Japan, companies do not put its logo (trademark)
on the official statement in common. Please tell over that to the bank.
We would like you to please send us all the lists of required documents.

Dear
Asami,
Thank
you for your email.
Please
find attached the 1st Page of Translation Certificate which has the incorrect
spelling of the word SAVINGS on it. Kindly correct it. Also, it will have to be
Notarized.
*Director
will have to bring his original passport to the bank.
Also,
the details of the ledger on the last page is very small and it will not be in
readable format when printed on paper. The table and details should be bigger
& clearer.
Moreover,
please advise if their bank can provide any document in English & has bank
logo on It and can prove that they have an account with the bank.
Kindly
also be advised that the documents are being reviewed by Formations House due
diligence team; the directors will be required to submit the documents to the
bank directly when they will visit London for the bank meeting.
I

Re: BUSINESS RESOURCES ASIA LIMITED ::REMINDER::
Dear Sarah,
Thank you for your reply.
Please find the translation of his account statement attached. Is there any
spelling error? The title is 'Savings Ledger'.
Translators do not attach such seals and signature on documents. Should our
client get them notarized instead? Please confirm.

Dear
Asami,
Thank
you for your email.
Please
note that your client can bring the Bank Statement and the certified
translation of the document. As advised, the original bank statements usually
have bank logo on it and it is printed on the letterhead of the Bank. The
director can explain it to the bank and can also provide the ‘Certificate of
Bank Balance’ which will also confirm his bank account details.
Regarding
Translation, please note that normally when a document is translated the
‘original document’ and the ‘certified translation’ is folded down together,
stapled, and the seal and signature placed over it.  It is Certified by a
publically-certified translator for that specific language and contain the
translator’s seal and attestation confirmation. The seal must also indicate the
language for which the translator is officially certified.
I
hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or
assistance, please feel free to E-mail.
I
look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Sarah,
Thank you for your email.
It is certain that the account statement was the original document. There is
no logo on the account statement. You may be able to call the bank at +81 (0)3
5745 5051 to confirm it and you need to tell that you are the English speaker
when you call bank. Please tell the bank that it is absolutely the original
document of the bank account statement Mitsui Sumitomo Bank issues.
I could not find the spelling mistake in the document. Could you please
indicate where the spelling error was occurred specifically?
How can we bound up the documents together? There is not such culture in Japan
so please teach us how to do it one by one.
Is it necessary to ask our client to submit the Certificate of Bank Balance?
We look forward to hearing from you.
