Dear Aela,

 

We have a new client who will be visiting Hong Kong in a few weeks.

We will be ordering a Virtual Office/ Mailing Address for him and a
registered address service for his Hong Kong company.

 

I wanted to ask if you know the KYC requirements for HSBC bank in Hong Kong,


I also wanted to ask if your company offer Nominee Director services for
Hong Kong companies where there is a joint UK director for the Hong Kong
company.
