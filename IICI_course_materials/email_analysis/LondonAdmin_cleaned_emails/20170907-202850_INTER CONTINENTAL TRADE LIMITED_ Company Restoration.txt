Dear Sarah

INTER CONTINENTAL TRADE LIMITED

Thank you for your enquiry of 22nd June 2017 concerning the restoration of
the above company.

The company was dissolved because the Accounts for the period ending 30th
April 2016 were never submitted.

There are two procedures for restoring companies to the register, which are:

            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are
to remain on the register)

            - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register
Companies House will require the following: -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter. Information regarding this can be obtained from the
B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors website -
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

3)  Confirmation Statement for the year ending 30th April 2017 and £40
Annual Filing Fee.

4)  Accounts for the period ending 30th April 2016

5) Late Filing Penalty of £3000 for the 2013 Accounts, £3000 for the 2014
Accounts, £3000 for the 2015 Accounts and £1500 for the 2016 Accounts

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to
follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating
details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the
register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the
Court .

Information  regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website
- https://www.gov.uk/guidance/company-restoration-guide

If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate
a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may use the same
name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees
payable.

Regards

Chi Yau
