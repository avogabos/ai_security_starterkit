Nadya,

I can host that call. You can introduce me via email and then I can set up a call or you can give them my direct as I am currently in Asia - +66894472452.

Do you know if they are a reseller of cards or are these payroll cards to pay individuals who did some sort of labor for the client?

Hi Guys,

We have a client who would like to discuss white label card services. Would we be able to give your contact details so they can talk about it directly with you? Thanks

Kind regards

Nadya
