James,

 

Below is what I got from the bank:

 

Scan003 - more detail in the business description, name of company who they
buys from etc., need to mention more about the business and a brief line on
the director background

 

Scan004 - with the partners, explain the relationship with each, 

Scan 005 - please state reason for Reitumu, because of European reach 

 

I'm going to need colour scans of the passport and bill for each shareholder

 

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

Subject: Setting up Lithuanian Bank Account

 

Hi Felix

 

After speaking to Oliver at Formations house, he has explained the situation
better, so I would like to proceed with the Lithuanian bank account.

 

He requested some more information on my company and a list of the countries
we would be dealing with:

 

Sokitome Inc manages a brand of toys called Hero Blast, these toys are aimed
at children aged 5-16, they are a laser tag based game using very advanced
wireless technology and laser optics. We are generally trading these toys
with companies across Middle East, Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe, and will
be offering consultancy and design services as well.

 

Below is a list of countries that we are currently in the process of setting
up accounts with

 

United Arab Emirates

Oman

Bahrain

Saudi Arabia

Kuwait

Qatar

Jordan

Nigeria

Egypt

South Africa

India

 

Please proceed with the application with the Lithuanian bank and please do
so with haste

 

Kind Regards
