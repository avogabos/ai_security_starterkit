Subject: Barclays - follow up

 

Hi again

 

I just got off phone to Barclays and finally managed to clear security.

 

Good news is that they have received my letter.

 

The account is now registered under 85 Great Portland Street address.

 

They are sending a copy of the Sept statement to correct address. All
subsequent ones too. Please forward as per usual.

 

It appears I have Online Banking but none of the ID's or passwords or token.
The Bank is sending all I need (to log on) to Tudor Research Group Ltd at 85
Great Portland St. Please forward to me in Singapore.

 

Please action other items in today's email i.e.  the receipt for GBP1,350
and the template / forms for compiling the annual financials for year ending
31st July 2017
