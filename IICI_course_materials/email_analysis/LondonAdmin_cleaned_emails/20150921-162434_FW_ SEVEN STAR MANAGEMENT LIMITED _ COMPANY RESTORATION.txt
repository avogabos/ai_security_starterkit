Hi!! This customer wants to restore the company and since the director
applied for this company to be voluntarily struck off the register, it can
only be restored by an Order of Court. Pls check and advise if we can do it
for this customer and the cost as we normally charge GBP 1800 for companies
which are striked off within a years time.

 

Thanks

Our Ref: REST/8540070/CES 
Date: 21 September 2015 

Dear Madam 

SEVEN STAR MANAGEMENT LIMITED 

Thank you for your e-mail dated 17 September 2015. 

I can confirm that the directors applied for this company to be voluntarily
struck off the register. 

I can confirm that the Administrative Restoration procedure does not apply
to companies struck off the Register at their own request.  A company that
has voluntarily applied to be struck off, can only be restored by an Order
of Court.  Information regarding this process can be obtained from the
Treasury Solicitors website -
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-legal-department or
from our website: www.companieshouse.gov.uk. 

The following documents and fees are also required as part of the
restoration process: 

Annual Return (form AR01) for 22 May 2015 

Filing fee of £40 

Late filing penalty of £150 outstanding on account for the period ending 31
May 2014. 

I hope this information has been of some use to you. 

Yours faithfully 

C E Street (Ms) 
Restoration Department
