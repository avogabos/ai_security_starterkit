Thanks Vincent




Biserka and Dimitar are both Directors.




Biserka is the sole shareholder.




I believe that Nadya has the documents you require.

Nadya,
I spoke to Marc yesterday who is assisting with this application, and the call went well. So far this is a suitable relationship - easy holding and investment account, they can benefit from our Saxo platform, and the transactions seem easy enough to process.
At this time, can you help me clarify these individuals:
SIGNATORIES:
- Biserka
- Dimitar
SHAREHOLDERS:

DIRECTORS:

Next, I'm ready for all remaining documentation.

Dear Vincent,
We had discussed this client a few months ago. They are intending to use your share management platform in the future.
Please find attached certified ID for DIMITROVA, Biserka, the pre-approval form and certified company docs for the BVI company WILDWOOD LIMTIED.
The corporate forms I will send in another email along with the ID of the second Director DIMIROV, Dimitar.
Kind regards
Nadya
