as we booked a bankservice over your company, i want this to work. you can not just tell us sorry first 9000 pounds is not available and now over 6000.....what do you think how much money we have available. 

 

as i told you yesterday when there is a change of director, the old director still has access as you had bevore so dont full me around.

 

i want you to tell me today what to do or we have to contact a lawyer this time. this is not working out this way.

 

we can close our company if we cannot pay our bills. i know you dont care but.......

 

cant understand how your company works but i will find out for sure if we dont have any solution by today

okay but the most important question of all is why the director change has not been done 2 month ago and how long it will take until we can do payments again as we otherwise dont need any further service as we cannot do business than :(

Claudia,
As soon as the new director has been transferred they will activate it.Secondly your service will expire next month. Kindly confirm if you would like to renew it.

Why is the account blocked? I send you over 2 invoices and you said you just received one . Next day I send you the one you did not get again.

Claudia,
The last payment conformation I had sent you please check your received emails I remember one invoice did not go through due to the account being blocked by the bank due to the transfer.
