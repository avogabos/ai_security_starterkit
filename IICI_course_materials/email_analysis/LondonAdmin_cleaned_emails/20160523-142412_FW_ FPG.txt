Fabrice,

 

I will check with Companies House today as to what seems to be the delay and get back to you.

Felix,

How come it is taking so much time to restore the company? It has been more than a month since you recieved the 2700£.

I have to make payments and execute business. Can you update me?

Thank you,

Fabrice

Fabrice,

 

I called them and they said it’s in process and will update me, I asked for a time frame and they did not give me any, I informed them that it was rather urgent and they said it’s in the process and will be done shortly.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.
