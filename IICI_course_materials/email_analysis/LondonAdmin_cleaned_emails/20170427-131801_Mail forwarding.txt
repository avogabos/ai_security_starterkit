Good afternoon,

I just received a mail item forwarded from 29 Harley St that was incorrectly franked.

The envelope was 20 millimetres too wide for Royal Mail's Large Letter format causing Royal Mail to apply a £3 fee.

I trust that this was just an oversight, however, I would be grateful if you could perhaps avoid using these unusually large envelopes or fold & tape over the side that makes it larger than the 35.3cm allowed for Larger Letters.

With many thanks and best wishes,

Dan
