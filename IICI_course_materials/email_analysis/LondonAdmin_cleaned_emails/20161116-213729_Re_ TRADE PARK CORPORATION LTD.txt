Hi Wade,

Our client Charlotte Pawar director and signatory of Trade Park Corporation Ltd, account number 19559119 (GBP), cannot log into her online account. Has it been closed?
If so how can we resolve this quickly? They are expecting to receive funds into this account imminently. Please could you kindly look into this.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
