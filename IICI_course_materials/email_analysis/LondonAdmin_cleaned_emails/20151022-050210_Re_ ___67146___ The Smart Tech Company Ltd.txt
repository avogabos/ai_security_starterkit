Hi Hui,
The client has come back to us with the following:
The banking facilities sole purpose is for the general running of the business.
Outgoing payments will be made towards research, preparation and manufacturing of the product, including materials and the electronic components required.
The main countries imminently involved in production will be China and the UK.
Incoming payments initially will be generated from the UK, by means of our online website, and mainstream retail outlets.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya
