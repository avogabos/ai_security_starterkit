Hi nadya,

 

Thank you for emailing scan copy of COGS.

 

With COGS the client has also ordered apostille.

 

So at the moment Oliver has emailed client to confirm whether the COGS has
to be apostilled or not.

 

Once the confirmation is received I will let you know so that you could
proceed accordingly.


Thank you.
