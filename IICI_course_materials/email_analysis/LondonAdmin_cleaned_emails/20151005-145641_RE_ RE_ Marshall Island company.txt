Nadya,

Let me jump in here while Ashe and Matt are on a conference call, and then they can add or correct me.

I’m assuming the POA is going to be a signatory on the bank account.

If so:

- He/she will need to sign as a signatory on the EPB contract: http://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_contract_corporate.pdf
- He/she will need to submit the standard docs that all signatories need to submit (the passport/ID, address proof, bank statements or bank ref): https://europacbank.com/registration/?panel=1#docs
- We’ll need a copy of the POA or Trust Deed

Regards,

Hi Matt, pleased to meet you!

Thanks!

I look forward to hearing from you.



Kind regards

Hi Nadya â€“

How are you?  Are you still receiving our friendly, weekly emails with tips and tricks?  If so, do you find them useful?

Since my colleague, Vincent, is now Head of Global Sales for Euro Pacific Bank, I will be your main point of contact moving forward.  You are also welcome to contact Mr. Matt Kellmer (CCâ€™d) who is on my team and works the European hours.

You are welcome to submit the application to our Account Management team via accounts@europacbank.com<mailto:accounts@europacbank.com> and theyâ€™ll be back in touch with you soon.  Binary options are considered higher risk, but as long as they arenâ€™t receiving and sending investment money from their clients, it should be OK.

Take care and feel free to contact me at any time.

Best,
Ashe

Nadya,

Quite well! Good to hear from you.

So far so good, although my Account Managers will be doing a little more due diligence on the actual transactions for the client.

Please start the process by:

1. Confirming that our wiring instructions (https://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_MT103.pdf) are suitable for you, as our USD route is unique: https://europacbank.com/support/usd-important-wiring-notice/
2. Register here: https://secure.europacbank.com/register.php
3. Please write â€œFormations Houseâ€ in the â€œHow did you hear about us?â€ section of the registration form.
4. Account Management staff will contact you, who are in charge of pre-approving your application. All application-related questions should be directed here.
5. Your dedicated Private Banker will also reach out to you to introduce himself/herself. General product and investment-related questions should be directed here.

p.s. I canâ€™t remember if I introduced you to Ashe Whitener, our new Head of Business Development yet. He is CCed and he will be a great resource to you.

Regards,
