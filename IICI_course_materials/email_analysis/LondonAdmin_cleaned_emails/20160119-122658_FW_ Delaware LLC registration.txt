Hello Charlotte,

 

Better Lifestyle LLC
Order no. 187611

Client has paid order on 18-12-2015

 

I want to process the LLC registration, I tried to send fax through our fax
admin but it shows failed. Also we contacted Delaware registry and they said
their fax numbers are working all right.

 

I have asked the tech support team to look into this matter but I haven't
receive any update from them so far.

Delaware registry has given another option to process the registration by
sending them the attached registration document by post to following
address:

Kim: You can mail the request in to our office. 

Kim: Please send to the address below:

Kim: Division of Corporations

Kim: 401 Federal Street, Ste 4

Kim: Dover, De  19901

Please advise if it's ok to post them the attached document for
registration?

Thank You.


Regards

 

Rachel
