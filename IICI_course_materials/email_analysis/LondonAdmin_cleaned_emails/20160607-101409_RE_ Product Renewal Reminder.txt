I have now received a message from your support teaming re hosting services.


 

Please note that: 

 

-          I wish to renew the hosting service for
barbicancorporatefinance.co.uk - Expiry Date: 29-08-2016 (Renewal Order No.
189856). 

 

-          However I do not know wish to renew the hosting service for
bocfe.co.uk (Renewal Order No. 189854). Mr Khan also agreed previously that
there are no arrears for these services.

Best Regards

 

Philip

Hi Philip,

 

You paid for the renewal of following domains:

 

bocfe.co.uk

barbicancorporatefinance.co.uk

 

However you have our hosting service for both domains and I believe the
support teaming will be contacting you about renewing this service. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya

Is this reminder for hosting services or domain registration (total charge
£50)? In this connection, I have already paid £20 for two domain
registrations a few weeks ago (include in payment of £120 on 15 April).

 

Best Regards
