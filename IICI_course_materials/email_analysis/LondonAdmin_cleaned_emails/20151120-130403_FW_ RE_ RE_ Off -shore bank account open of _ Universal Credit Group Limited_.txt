Dear Felix,

It seems to me that the UK bank account open is not successful. Could you
help to arrange the off-shore bank account for my company.

Even no matter the UK bank account open is successful or not, please help to
arrange the off-shore bank for my company as my services requested from you.

Thanks for your support.

Best regards,

Andy Au Yeung
