Subject: Euro Pacific Bank Call

 

Dear Sarah,

 

I had a call yesterday from a man saying that he was from Euro Pacific Bank, he asked me several questions relating to the company and also asking where funds where coming from etc. 

 

He mentioned that they will be calling you guys with regards to my application, please can you update me with regards to communication with the bank, as I felt not prepared for the call. Also I would have thought the bank would call from a not with held number.

 

I hope all things being well, that the account is open as soon as possible.

 

Kind regards

 

Ross
