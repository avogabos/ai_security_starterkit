Dear Danielle,

 

I hope all is well with you.

 

Fish Financial Index Limited

ID: 56618985

 

Please accept all mails for the above company. The customer is expecting
mail from LLOYDS TSB. The customer has mistakenly purchased VO phone & Fax.
This is sarah's customer. She has sent the customer an email if he would
like to upgrade to the VO mail forwarding as well OR would he like us to
cancel the VO Phone & Fax service and use the amounts for VO mail forwarding
as initially required.

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael
