Dear Charlotte

 

Thanks. 

 

1)     SERVICES AGREEMENT & CDD on Accounts Centre Limited 

 

Thanks for sending the application form. However, we did not receive the MLR
certificate nor the CDD on Danielle Ardern.

 

So that we can update our records, please send scanned copies first of the
proof of address and ID document for Danielle Ardern, with notarized copies
to be provided in due course. 

 

On Accounts Centre Limited we will also require scanned copies of the
following due diligence, with notarized copies provided in due course:

 

a)     Certificate of Incorporation 

b)    Memorandum & Articles of Association

c)     Register of Directors

d)    Register of Members 

 

2)     US$18,000

 

I confirm that our account has been credited with the US$18,000, which we
will use in reduction of the debt. We will send an updated Statement of
Account later today. 

 

3)     ANNUAL RETURNS FOR RENEWALS

 

I refer to my circular email of the 26 June 2015 (copy attached) where we
informed clients of our new policy of ensuring that client companies comply
with their obligations of providing us as registered agent with the Annual
Return. As a new policy, we informed clients that we will only renew IBCs if
we receive the Annual Return. 

 

I attach our IBC Compliance Requirements Summary that provides further
information on the Annual Return. 

 

I note that services for the following IBC are required immediately:

 


World Class Group Consultants Inc


Total Brand Security Ltd. 


Pure Diamond Holdings Ltd


360 Solutions Limited 


Rose Developments Limited 

 

Upon checking our records, we found that the Annual Returns for the year
2015 were not provided. Please attend to providing the Annual Returns so
that we can proceed with the renewals. Refer paragraph 8 of the attached IBC
Compliance Requirements Summary for details on how to complete the Annual
Returns. 

 

Kind regards

Dear Peter, 

  

Due to the bank holiday yesterday we did not yet have an opportunity to
reply. 

  

Thank you for this consideration. We have submitted the payments for the
companies in particular, and later we will forward proof of payments, 

We shall then endeavour to bring the account completely up to date before
the end of October, and moving forward new orders shall be paid up in
advance, 

  

On the question of ID documents, Please confirm that under our MLR agreement
in the UK we are certified to certify ID documents whereby we have seen the
original. For some of the existing customers, requesting notarised or
certified from a source other than ourselves will cause problems as in the
past our certification was always acceptable. 

  

I shall check on the last payments, as I am sure we have made payments since
21st, however we are using HSBC now and they did have some payment issues
last week,

Im re-sending my below email of last Friday in case of non-receipt. 

  

The renewals of the relevant companies are on hold pending your response to
my below email. We note that you have indicated that the renewals are
urgent. 

  

We also note that you said that Formations House will try to make payments
almost daily. Unfortunately we have not received a payment in reduction of
the debt since 21 August 2015.

Subject: FORMATIONS HOUSE - OUSTANDING DEBT 

  

Dear Charlotte 

  

Thank you for your email to my colleague, Gemma Mein. As Sam Solomon is
aware, I am handling the communications in respect of Formation Houses debt
to Mayfair and please direct further correspondence to me. 

  

I refer to my various unanswered emails to Formations House over recent
months and to unanswered email sent by our Finance Department dating back to
2014. As you are well aware, Formations House owes a substantial debt to
Mayfair Trust Group Limited (Mayfair) for unpaid invoices going back to
2014. Despite several recent part-payments made by Formations House, the
total amount still due and payable by Formations House to Mayfair is
US$41,659.75. In that regard I attach an up-to-date Statement of Account. 

  

Your approach in ignoring our communications for many months and ignoring
your legal liability to pay your debt to Mayfair is regrettable. If you
could not pay for our services you should not have placed service orders.
You (not your clients) are legally liable to pay for services which you
ordered from Mayfair. 

  

In my email of 7 August 2015 (PDF copy attached), on Mayfairs behalf I gave
Formations House express warning that unless the full outstanding amount of
the debt was paid within 10 days of the email (i.e. by no later than 18
August 2015) that, with effect from expiry of the said 10 day period (i.e.
as from 18 August 2015) and pursuant to our rights under our Services
Agreement, that the Services Agreement between Mayfair and Accounts Centre
Ltd / Formations House would terminate. 

  

Consequently, as Formations House failed to pay the full amount of its debt
to Mayfair by 18 August 2015, as from that date the Services Agreement
between you and us has ended, though of course Formations House remains
liable to us for the outstanding debt (US$ US$41,659.75). 

  

Having said the above, as you have indicated that you are going to make
efforts to clear all invoices and wish to rekindle our relationship, we have
reconsidered our position.  We would be willing to continue providing
services on the following conditions: 

  

(i)                 Formations House must show good faith by making a
significant part-payment off the debt, of not less than US$20,000, by 4 pm
on Tuesday 8 September 2015; with the remaining outstanding balance to
thereafter be paid off in a timely fashion and at the latest by 31 October
2015; 

(ii)               That a new Services Agreement be entered into by
Formations House (as technically the previous one has terminated)  refer
below; 

(iii)             That Formations House provide Mayfair with customer due
diligence (CDD) on each director, shareholder and beneficial owner of each
IBC for which services are required  refer below. 

  

We will renew the companies in question and will provide the certificates
and apostille on the basis of a payment of US$20,000 and payment in advance
for the services you require. Our team will inform you of the amount for
each company in question. If the US$20,000 part-payment is not received by 4
pm on Tuesday 8 September 2015 then we will once again terminate our
Services Agreement with you, which will mean that we will cease provision of
all services  so you would in that event need to change Seychelles
Registered Agent (CSP). However, please note that under Seychelles law
(section 39A of the IBC Act 1994) an existing Registered Agent is not
required to give its consent to a change of Registered Agent of an existing
IBC if there are unpaid fees due and owing to the outgoing Registered Agent.
Accordingly, Mayfair will not be giving our consent to any change of
Registered Agent of your client IBCs unless and until Formation Houses
outstanding debt to us is paid in full. 

  

New Business & Ongoing services 

  

To avoid any further debt arising, Mayfair is no longer willing to provide
services on a credit basis. All fees will need to be paid in advance prior
to Mayfair providing services. Formations House should collect funds from
clients prior to ordering services from us. To speed up our ability to
provide services, we suggest that Formations House maintains a credit
balance in our books, or provides us with credit card details that we can
charge whenever you require a service. 

  

New Services Agreement and CDD on Formations House  Accounts Centre 

  

As the Services Agreement with Formations House has terminated, we will
require for Formations House / Accounts Centre to enter into a new Services
Agreement with us. In this respect, please complete our attached
Professional Client Application Form and provide up-to-date due diligence
documents listed in Part 4 of the Professional Client Application Form
relating to Accounts Centre Limited. 

  

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) on Formation House IBCs 

  

Under the Services Agreement (and of course under the English Money
Laundering Regulations), Formations House / Accounts Centre has an
obligation to collect and maintain client due diligence on its client
companies. You have always been prompt in providing CDD on request and we
understand that your standard practice is for Formations House to collect
CDD from all client IBCs. 

  

As we have Seychelles AML obligations, we will need to collect in due course
CDD on the Formations House IBCs. We already hold CDD (provided by you) on
some of your client IBCs, but we will be sending by separate email a full
list of the IBCs for which CDD remains outstanding. In the meantime, please
provide CDD as follows on each company for which services are provided: 

  

·         Certified passport copy of each beneficial owner, director and
shareholder; 

·         Certified proof of address document of each beneficial owner,
director and shareholder; 

·         Particulars of the business activities of the company; 

·         Source and origin of wealth of the client. 

  

Please refer to the attached IBC CDD Requirements Memo for further details
on our CDD policy, procedures and requirements. 

  

We look forward to hearing further from you. 

  

Kind regards

Dear Gemma, 

  

We understand, and we are now making an effort to clear all invoices
outstanding as quickly as we can and hope to have our account up to date
within 2 weeks, however we have made certain invoices more urgent as our
clients require the certificates urgently. 

  

Although we have previously been a very good agent of yours, we realise the
last year has been difficult to maintain our relationship due to funds
outstanding. The financial constraints we faced did not alleviate as
expected however please be assured we are now back to the path to being able
to clear all invoices and bring forth a renewed strong relationship with
Mayfair. 

  

Our clients will continue to be our clients and by proxy your clients if we
can deliver to them the certificates they urgently require. 

  

We ask if you can please add some urgency to the delivery of the
certificates ordered, and note we have started paying off the invoices and
will continue almost daily to make a payment,

Dear Charlotte
Thanks.
1)
SERVICES AGREEMENT & CDD on Accounts Centre Limited
Thanks for sending the application form. However, we did not receive the MLR certificate nor the CDD on Danielle Ardern.
So that we can update our records, please send scanned copies first of the proof of address and ID document for Danielle Ardern, with notarized copies to be provided in due course.
On Accounts Centre Limited we will also require scanned copies of the following due diligence, with notarized copies provided in due course:
a)

b)

c)

d)
Register of Members
2)
US$18,000
I confirm that our account has been credited with the US$18,000, which we will use in reduction of the debt. We will send an updated Statement of Account later today.
3)
ANNUAL RETURNS FOR RENEWALS
I refer to my circular email of the 26 June 2015 (copy attached) where we informed clients of our new policy of ensuring that client companies comply with their obligations of providing us as registered agent with the Annual Return. As a new policy, we informed clients that we will only renew IBCs if we receive the Annual Return.
I attach our IBC Compliance Requirements Summary that provides further information on the Annual Return.
I note that services for the following IBC are required immediately:
World Class Group Consultants Inc
Total Brand Security Ltd.
Pure Diamond Holdings Ltd
360 Solutions Limited
Rose Developments Limited
Upon checking our records, we found that
the Annual Returns for the year 2015 were not provided
. Please attend to providing the Annual Returns so that we can proceed with the renewals. Refer paragraph 8 of the attached IBC Compliance Requirements Summary for details on how to complete the Annual Returns.

We have scanned ID docs for Danielle too, of which I shall pop over to you by email tomorrow but if you required original notarised I will need a few extra days to arrange. Also I will attach the MLR cert for reference.

Dear Peter,
Due to the bank holiday yesterday we did not yet have an opportunity to reply.
Thank you for this consideration. We have submitted the payments for the companies in particular, and later we will forward proof of payments,
We shall then endeavour to bring the account completely up to date before the end of October, and moving forward new orders shall be paid up in advance,
On the question of ID documents, Please confirm that under our MLR agreement in the UK we are certified to certify ID documents whereby we have seen the original. For some of the existing customers, requesting notarised or certified from a source other than ourselves will cause problems as in the past our certification was always acceptable.
I shall check on the last payments, as I am sure we have made payments since 21
st
, however we are using HSBC now and they did have some payment issues last week,

FORMATIONS HOUSE - OUSTANDING DEBT
Dear Charlotte
Thank you for your email to my colleague, Gemma Mein. As Sam Solomon is aware, I am handling the communications in respect of Formation House’s debt to Mayfair and please direct further correspondence to me.
I refer to my various unanswered emails to Formations House over recent months and to unanswered email sent by our Finance Department dating back to 2014. As you are well aware, Formations House owes a substantial debt to Mayfair Trust Group Limited (“
Mayfair
”) for unpaid invoices going back to 2014. Despite several recent part-payments made by Formations House,
the total amount still due and payable by Formations House to Mayfair is US$41,659.75.
In that regard I attach an up-to-date Statement of Account.
Your approach in ignoring our communications for many months and ignoring your legal liability to pay your debt to Mayfair is regrettable. If you could not pay for our services you should not have placed service orders. You (not your clients) are legally liable to pay for services which you ordered from Mayfair.
In my email of 7 August 2015 (PDF copy attached), on Mayfair’s behalf I gave Formations House express warning that unless the full outstanding amount of the debt was paid within 10 days of the email (i.e. by no later than 18 August 2015) that, with effect from expiry of the said 10 day period (i.e. as from 18 August 2015) and pursuant to our rights under our Services Agreement, that the Services Agreement between Mayfair and Accounts Centre Ltd / Formations House would terminate.
Consequently, as Formations House failed to pay the full amount of its debt to Mayfair by 18 August 2015, as from that date the Services Agreement between you and us has ended, though of course Formations House remains liable to us for the outstanding debt (US$ US$41,659.75).
Having said the above, as you have indicated that you are going to make efforts to clear all invoices and wish to rekindle our relationship, we have reconsidered our position.  We would be willing to continue providing services on the following conditions:
(i)
Formations House must show good faith by making a significant part-payment off the debt, of not less than US$20,000, by 4 pm on Tuesday 8 September 2015; with the remaining outstanding balance to thereafter be paid off in a timely fashion and at the latest by 31 October 2015;
(ii)
That a new Services Agreement be entered into by Formations House (as technically the previous one has terminated) – refer below;
(iii)
That Formations House provide Mayfair with customer due diligence (CDD) on each director, shareholder and beneficial owner of each IBC for which services are required – refer below.
We will renew the companies in question and will provide the certificates and apostille on the basis of a payment of US$20,000 and payment in advance for the services you require. Our team will inform you of the amount for each company in question. If the US$20,000 part-payment is not received by 4 pm on Tuesday 8 September 2015 then we will once again terminate our Services Agreement with you, which will mean that we will cease provision of all services – so you would in that event need to change Seychelles Registered Agent (CSP). However, please note that under Seychelles law (section 39A of the IBC Act 1994) an existing Registered Agent is not required to give its consent to a change of Registered Agent of an existing IBC if there are unpaid fees due and owing to the outgoing Registered Agent. Accordingly, Mayfair will not be giving our consent to any change of Registered Agent of your client IBCs unless and until Formation House’s outstanding debt to us is paid in full.
New Business & Ongoing services
To avoid any further debt arising, Mayfair is no longer willing to provide services on a credit basis. All fees will need to be paid in advance prior to Mayfair providing services. Formations House should collect funds from clients prior to ordering services from us. To speed up our ability to provide services, we suggest that Formations House maintains a credit balance in our books, or provides us with credit card details that we can charge whenever you require a service.
New Services Agreement and CDD on Formations House – Accounts Centre
As the Services Agreement with Formations House has terminated, we will require for Formations House / Accounts Centre to enter into a new Services Agreement with us. In this respect, please complete our attached
Professional Client Application Form
and provide up-to-date due diligence documents listed in Part 4 of the Professional Client Application Form relating to Accounts Centre Limited.
Customer Due Diligence (CDD) on Formation House IBCs
Under the Services Agreement (and of course under the English Money Laundering Regulations), Formations House / Accounts Centre has an obligation to collect and maintain client due diligence on its client companies. You have always been prompt in providing CDD on request and we understand that your standard practice is for Formations House to collect CDD from all client IBCs.
As we have Seychelles AML obligations, we will need to collect in due course CDD on the Formations House IBCs. We already hold CDD (provided by you) on some of your client IBCs, but we will be sending by separate email a full list of the IBCs for which CDD remains outstanding. In the meantime, please provide CDD as follows on each company for which services are provided:
·
Certified passport copy of each beneficial owner, director and shareholder;
·
Certified proof of address document of each beneficial owner, director and shareholder;
·
Particulars of the business activities of the company;
·
Source and origin of wealth of the client.
Please refer to the attached IBC CDD Requirements Memo for further details on our CDD policy, procedures and requirements.
We look forward to hearing further from you.

RE: WORLD CLASS GROUP CONSULTANTS INC.
Dear Gemma,
We understand, and we are now making an effort to clear all invoices outstanding as quickly as we can and hope to have our account up to date within 2 weeks, however we have made certain invoices more urgent as our clients require the certificates urgently.
Although we have previously been a very good agent of yours, we realise the last year has been difficult to maintain our relationship due to funds outstanding. The financial constraints we faced did not alleviate as expected however please be assured we are now back to the path to being able to clear all invoices and bring forth a renewed strong relationship with Mayfair.
Our clients will continue to be our clients and by proxy your clients if we can deliver to them the certificates they urgently require.
We ask if you can please add some urgency to the delivery of the certificates ordered, and note we have started paying off the invoices and will continue almost daily to make a payment,

Hi,
Please email us the invoice for renewing the Seychelles Company WORLD CLASS GROUP CONSULTANTS INC.
We look forward to hear from you.
Best Regards,
Rachel
Formations HouseDear Valued Client 

 

We refer to the various emails we sent since the enactment of the
International Business Companies (Amendment) Act 2013 (which amended the
International Business Companies Act 1994 (the IBC Act)), which introduced
the Annual Return requirement. 

 

1.         NEW POSITION RELATING TO IBC ANNUAL RETURNS 

 

1.1        While section 119 of the IBC Act provides that each IBC must
provide to its Seychelles Registered Agent an Annual Return Declaration by
the 31 December of each year, the Financial Services Authority (the FSA),
has recently introduced binding guidelines governing how Annual Returns are
to be provided by an IBC to its Registered Agent. The new position is as
follows:

 

The Annual Return must be made as at the IBCs annual renewal date (i.e.
anniversary of the companys incorporation date) and must be furnished to
its Registered Agent in Seychelles as follows:

            

(a)        if the companys annual renewal date is from 1 January to 30
September, the Annual Return must be furnished by the IBC to its Registered
Agent by 31 December of that same year; 

(b)        if the companys annual renewal date is from 1 October to 31
December, the Annual Return must be furnished by the IBC to its Registered
Agent by 31 December of the following year. 

 

1.2        Please find attached our updated IBC Compliance Requirements
Summary (the Summary). Paragraph 8 covers the up-to-date position relating
to Annual Returns. Please review the entire Summary carefully and we draw
your attention to the application of penalties for non-compliance. It is set
out in Annexure B of the Summary but we also separately attach our
up-to-date Annual Return template. Please use this latest version and delete
all previous versions.

 

1.3        As previously advised, the FSA has granted an extension until the
30 June 2015 for any IBC that has not yet provided its Annual Return to its
Registered Agent if the IBCs renewal due date was between 1 January 2014 
30 September 2014 (as the deadline for providing such Annual Return was the
31 December 2014). IBCs that had a renewal due date between 1 January 2014 
30 September 2014 and which have not yet provided their 2014 Annual Returns
should send to our attention their 2014 Annual Return as soon as possible
and no later than 30 June 2015. 

 

1.4        IBCs that had a renewal due date between 1 October 2014 - 31
December 2014 have to provide the 2014 Annual Return by the 31 December
2015. Compliance with section 119 of the IBC Act (Annual Return requirement)
is considered to have been met if you have already provided to us the 2014
Annual Return for IBCs that had a renewal due date between 1 October 2014 -
31 December 2014.

 

2.         ANNUAL RETURNS WITH RENEWALS 

 

In the interest of clients complying with their record keeping obligations
and to avoid having to incur penalties for non-compliance, Mayfair will
introduce a policy of only renewing IBCs with the Registry upon receiving a
scanned copy of the Annual Return. We will be providing reminders of renewal
in our usual format (i.e. by providing monthly renewal reminders and
statements starting three months prior to renewal) and will enclose with
each renewal statement our Annual Return template.

 

As you will be communicating with clients over receiving renewal
instructions (and payment of your renewal fees), the best time to
successfully receive from clients the signed Annual Return is at the time of
renewal. While this policy does not reflect the FSAs guidelines on the
submission of the Annual Return, you and your clients will appreciate the
benefits of achieving compliance (and avoid potential penalties) by linking
the Annual  Return to the renewal of companies. 

 

We attach for your general reference a copy of our revised Renewal
Statement. When completing it with instructions, please ensure that a
scanned copy Annual Return is attached with each renewal instruction. In the
absence of receiving the Annual Return, we will not renew the Company, but
will provide a note to that effect in the next monthly renewal statement
that we will send. 

 

Whereas you may have provided us recently with the 2014 Annual Return, we
would require for any IBCs for which you request renewal to provide us with
the 2015 Annual Return to be made as at the upcoming renewal date. 

 

Please note that if Mayfair provides director services, you are not required
to provide the Annual Return as we will attend to completing and signing the
return for the relevant company. 

 

Please let us know If you have any queries. 

 

Kind regards
