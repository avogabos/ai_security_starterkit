Hi Nadya,

I assume it will be ok to go in to my local branch of Metro Bank as I did previously.

Hi Andrew,

Just spoke with the bank manager he has confirmed that you are now on the account.
So you will need to go into a Branch and set yourself up with the online banking etc, please take your ID with you and remove me from the account also (mandate attached) if you could please print, fill sign and take it into the branch with you. Please also have the customer number they issued to you.

There are 2 accounts linked so please ensure I’m removed from both.
