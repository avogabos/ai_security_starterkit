Dear Madam
 

JOINT BUSINESS LTD

 
Thank you for your e-mail of 1 March 2017 concerning the restoration of the above company.
 

The company was dissolved for non-filing of statutory documents.
 

There are two procedures for restoring a companies to the register, which are:

                - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)

                - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

 

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -
 

1) RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.00
 

2) The BV waiver letter. This can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1
 

3) Confirmation Statement form CS01 for the date 18 December 2016 with a filing fee of £40.00. Please ensure along with the Confirmation
 Statement you also complete Parts 1-5 of the form.
 

4) Accounts for the period ending 31 December 2015
 

Having checked our records there is a late filing penalty of £750.00 due for the 2015 Accounts.
  

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

 
An Application/Claim Form CPR (Part 8), and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed
 from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court.

 
Information regarding this can be found on the Government Legal Department website https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-company-restoration
 and http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk .
 

If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you
 may use the same name. This option can be cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

 

Yours faithfully

Sara Walter
