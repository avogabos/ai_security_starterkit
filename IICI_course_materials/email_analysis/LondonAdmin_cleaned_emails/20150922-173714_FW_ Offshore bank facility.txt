If you want yourself to be the signatory.

 

You sign all forms and send all your notarized ID docs

 

I will keep you updated, if the bank further ask anything else

Dear Oliver

Thanks, I have received all 3 of the forms,
Just to be clear, Ian Todd-Weller is not having anything to do with the banking facility,

I am the major share holder, and it will be my signature on all banking requests,

Does Ian Tod-Weller need to sign all 3 forms as well, or is it just my signature?

Do you need the ID documentation for Ian Todd-Weller as well?

Regards

Mark Barnett

we  need the following ID docs, they need to be clear scans, we do not need the originals:

 

Passport – Notarised

Proof of Address (preferably Bank Statement) – Notarised

2 Bank Statements (one can be as above  if recent) and the 2nd should be about 5-6 months old

 

Best regards

Good evening Oliver

In reference to our conversation last week,

I still have not received the bank application documents, you promised to forward.

As I stressed to you, the completion of the bank account, for The Smart Tech Company is urgently required in order for me to begin utilizing the company facility.

Any assistance you can offer towards this would be greatly appreciated.

Regards

Mark Barnett
