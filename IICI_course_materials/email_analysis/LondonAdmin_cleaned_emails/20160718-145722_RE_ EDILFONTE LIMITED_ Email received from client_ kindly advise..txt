This is something I can't answer today! I can ask Charlotte on
Monday.however I think she will give a similar answer.

 

But I'm thinking how are we supposed to know what this IT company wants or
not ? not sure we can provide proof of transfer .think that's from the
Italian side of things?! 

 

The apostille shows that the company is registered in the UK and shows all
members of the company and is an official document notarised and then
apostilled.  

 

Sorry I'm not much help!
