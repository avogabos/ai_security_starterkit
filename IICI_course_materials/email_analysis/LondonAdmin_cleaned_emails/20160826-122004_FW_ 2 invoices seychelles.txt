Subject: 2 invoices seychelles

 

Hi Charlotte,

I sent 2 invoices for seychelles

1 was for mayfair
1 was for ac management.

Could you please confirm if invoices have been paid, also i mistakenly mentioned mayfair for both in the previous email. But there are 2 invoice, one for mayfair and unitrade is for AC Management.

Please advise if the payment is made now?
