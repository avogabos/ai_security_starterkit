Dear Felix,

 

Please use the address on the bank statement please. I am so sorry for the confusion, its just that I wanted the communication address to be the one with number 152 Viceroy Close.

 

The business activity is :

Manufacture, retail, wholesale, repair vehicles and vehicle parts and accessories ; renting and leasing of vehicles.

 

Also, I think I have made a mistake when making the application. We wanted to set-up a limited company, not a company limited by guarantee. 

 

I am so sorry for the troubles I have caused. Thank you very much for your help.

 

Best Regards,

 

Meng Li

director address on application does not match the address on bank statement. please confirm the address. Or we could use the address as per the statement. Please confirm.

We also require the business activity because this is a company limited by guarantee and we need to know the amount to be guaranteed.
