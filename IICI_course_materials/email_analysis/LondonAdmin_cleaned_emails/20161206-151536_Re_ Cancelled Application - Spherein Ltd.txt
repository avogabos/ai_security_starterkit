Hi Nadya,


Thanks for the follow-up. I'll leave the app as suspended for now, if you do hear from the client feel free to re-introduce and we can take it from there.


Friday afternoon sounds great, I'll give you a shout then.

Hi Matt,

We did assist in incorporating this company however there is no record of us assisting with the bank account application.

I should be around on Friday afternoon UK time. Perhaps that would be ok?

Kind regards

Hi Nadya,



I hope this email finds you well. I was just notified by our banking staff that the application for Spherein Ltd has been cancelled due to being unable to get in touch with the client. Do you know if the client is still interested in pursuing the account?



Also, I have a few developments and updates to share. When suits to connect for a quick chat?
