Dear Felix,

 

Unfortunately my client totally lost a trust in me/us that Account will be opened.

He commented to last e-mail, that he already gives everything possible, you also have the banjk contact and you can check it if you like.

 

If not it’s already 5 month from given advance payment, he ask to return his found, if you had any cost till now you can deduct them.

 

Also he would like to see the document where is shown the address of his new Company: memorandum and articles of association , where should state the name of the company, the registered office and the company objectives and govern the company's internal affairs. I trust it has to be disclosed to the company register with Form IN01 during company incorporation. 

That was advised by his layer , as that we didn’t present such. 

 

I searched on the on-line administrator, and also couldn’t find such.

 

Waiting for your reply.

 

Kind regards, Mitja

A few comments from compliance:

The bank contract, does not list a bank in the source of funds, this is a requirement please update the contract, the client can enter their bank account.

The recent bank statement is dated July, however it is now October, we will need a statement less than 1 month old from the same bank account.

Last but not least, please have the client review the restricted countries list document attached, specifically for potential wires.

Thank you,
