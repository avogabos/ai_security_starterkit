Dear Nadya

Attached please find for your attention copies of the filed 2014 and 2015 annual return of the Company.

We have revised the amount of total number of share and total amount of capital to 1 and HK$1 respectively.  Please note that authorised capital was abolished.

We also complete the annual return as appropriate.

Sorry for our late reply as my boss was out of town and it takes a longer time for our accounting department to issue the cheque.

Best regards
Angela Jen

Dear Nelly,

We require your services in paper filling the Annual Returns for WORLDWIDE VENTURES LIMITED as we do not have the authentication code for this company.

The return that we submitted by post (year 2014-2015) has been rejected by HK registry, we assumed that we would have been billed for it afterwards. In any case we are unable to make this payment as the Registry have stated the following:

For overseas payers, a bank draft in Hong Kong Dollars made payable to "Companies Registry" and drawn on a licensed bank in Hong Kong is required.

We currently cannot acquire this at the moment and this is a matter of urgency.

We need to pay $3,480HKD for the 2014 Annual Return and $870HKD for the 2015 Annual Return.

Please would you be able to kindly file this for us and make the payment on our behalf this time?

I am sending you the correct signed original documents out today, I hope you will receive by Monday/Tuesday if you could you kindly send us an invoice with the additional fees we will make the payment straight away.

Please note I will be out of the office on Monday and back on Tuesday.

Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards
Nadya
