Hi Nadya

Thanks for letting me know. Much appreciated.
I'm a little confused though.
I don't get to speak to my account much anymore.
I was under the impression that the tax was taken care of. I didn't ask at
the time.
I wish I had now.

Many thanks
Dan

I cannot give an exact estimate of your personal liability as its dependent on the rest of your income for the year and your tax code, but at the end of this personal tax year you will need to file the self assessment and pay tax to HMRC of approximately £970.
Please ensure you include this in your Self Assessment as you will be required to file one as you were a director of a company with filed accounts during the tax year 16/17.
I trust you have no questions.
Kind Regards
Nadya.

Self Assessment earnings tax
Hello Dan,
The Accounts for Mobile Electrics are being prepared for all income to June 2016 and will soon be filed at Companies House. You were operating the company at this time. We have some copies of invoices that were paid to the company, however we can see that the payments received then went to you as your earnings. I don’t need anything from you for us to prepare and file the accounts.
However, please note you will be required to disclose these earning in a Self Assessment form and pay the required tax based on all other income. Total seems to be around £6,000 on top of whatever else you earned in 2015/16 and 2016/2017 which is nearly complete.
It appears that some of your earnings would have fallen into the 2015/2016 tax year as you received the income before April. This will now be overdue unless you filed before the January 2017 deadline.
If you have not we request you file and confirm as we must maintain the previous accounts history for the company.
Earnings you received from the company should be included in your 2016/17 tax return which may be filed after April and must be prepped and filed by October if using paper forms.
Failure to file will incur a penalty.
Let me know what and when you have or will file so we can keep it in our records.
Kind Regards
Nadya
