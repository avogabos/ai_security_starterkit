Hi

 

There original query is this

 

We will set up a new UK company for our customer , and this UK company’s documents need to notarize for Taipei Representative Office in the UK, Would you have provide this service ? how about the fees and completed of the time

?

 

We need to notarize the documents as below:

 

1)   1 Copy of Cert. of Incorporation

2)   2 Power Of Attorney (Original) – We provide

3)   1 Certificate of board resolutions (Original) - We provide

4)   1 New UK company’s MEMORANDUM & ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION – You provide

 

 

So in point 1 & 4 , we can do that, but they needed to be notarized from Taipei Representative Office in the UK

 

Can we do it
