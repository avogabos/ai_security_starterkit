Hi Shawn,

 

Thank you for looking into this for me. 

 

I am very disappointed with the response I have received from you, however
either do I have time to contact my local post office or discuss this matter
any further with you. 

 

Is it possible I can pay for a replacement for the certificate of
incorporation for one2one business consultants and can this be sent via
recorded signed for post?

 

I am going to apply for a security code from companies house to have the
address changed, please can you forward me this letter once you have
received it. 

 

Today, I have lost a company that I have used for many years and you have
lost a good customer. 

 

Thank you for all your help and support.

 

Kind Regards
