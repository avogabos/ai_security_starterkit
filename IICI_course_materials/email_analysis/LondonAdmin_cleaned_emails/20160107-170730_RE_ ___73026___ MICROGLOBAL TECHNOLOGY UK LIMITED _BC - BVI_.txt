Dear Michael,

We have received following message from Euro Pacific Bank;

From: Accounts - Euro Pacific Bank
To: @formationshouse.com
Subject: Re: MICROGLOBAL TECHNOLOGY UK LIMITED (BC - BVI)

Dear Formations House,

The compliance has reviewed the documents and wrote:

Both Chuntao Liang and Yan Chi signed the Bank Contract, however on the Corporate Resolution only Yan Chi was authorized to operate the account.

Client confirmed to the email dated 17th December 2015 that the client was happy to just have Yan Cui as the sole signatory.

Please amend the Bank Contract with Yan Cui signing solely, and leave Chuntao in the UBO information box, page 5.

-------------------------------------------------------

Please do what is required as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Regards

Steve
