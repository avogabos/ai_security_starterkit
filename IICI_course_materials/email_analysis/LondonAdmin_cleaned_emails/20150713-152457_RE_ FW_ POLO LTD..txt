Hi Charlotte,

 

POLO LTD

Order no. 153153

 

This was a readymade with managed company pack; customer does not want
managed company any more and has provided his details to be appointed as
director and shareholder.

I will do the appointments, but he also wants the bank account for the
company (opened in RBS) transferred to him,

 

Please check and confirm if we can transfer the bank account to client and
how long will it take?

 

Regards,

 

Rachel
