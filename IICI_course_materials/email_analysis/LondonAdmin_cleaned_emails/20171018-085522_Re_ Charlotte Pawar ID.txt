Dear Mr Kuhn,

Its rather urgent and someone can be at your office at whatever time. The business plan will be an original signed document.

 

Please can you see if there is any way you can squeeze us in before Friday?

thanks

Dear Ms Pawar,

 

thank you for your e-mail. I can certify a copy of the business plan, provided the original is produced to me. However, looking into my diary, I cannot offer an appointment before Friday. 

 

Kind regards

Dear Mr. Kuhn,

 

You have twice previously notarised a copy of the attached passport belonging to Charlotte Pawar (the director of Formations House), is it possible I can send Darius today or tomorrow early to obtain another notarised copy along with a copy of a utility bill. He can bring the originals of both.

She also requires a business plan to be certified as a true copy, will you be able to do this also?

 

Please let me know a suitable time

Kind Regards
