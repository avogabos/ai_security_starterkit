Hi Nadya,
You don't need to do anything... I'll get the cars put through an MOT on Saturday and the road tax will automatically renew.
I also sent through a couple of payment requests to Charlotte this week, but haven't had the usual read notification. Could you get them out through, please?
Thanks,
Jason

Hi Jason,
We received these letters yesterday. Would you like us to renew these?
Kind regards
Nadya
