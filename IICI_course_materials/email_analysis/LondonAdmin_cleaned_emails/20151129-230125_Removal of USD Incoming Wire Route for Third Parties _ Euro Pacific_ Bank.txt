    USD Currency Update      
    Dear Esteemed Partner   
 Euro Pacific Bank (EPB) no longer facilitates USD wires from third parties. We kindly ask that you take a few minutes to read the details below.      
    What Does This Mean?   
 Effective immediately, EPB clients can no longer receive USD currency wires from third parties . This includes wires from clients, suppliers, partners and other business associates.   
 First Party Wires   
 Clients are still able to receive first party wires from an account (personal and/or corporate) that belongs to the client.      
    Other Services NOT Impacted   
 
1. USD first-party INCOMING transfers 
2. USD third-party OUTGOING transfers 
3. USD denominated debit cards 
4. USD currency conversions 
5. USD deposit accounts and balances 
6. USD investments and brokerage      
    Why Is This Change Occurring?   
 As previously noted, USD correspondent banking for international financial institutions is becoming a critical issue. These concerns have been raised by many organizations including the  http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d136.pdf  BIS [ http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d136.pdf ], the  http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/Correspondent-banking-report-to-G20-Summit.pdf  FSB [ http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/Correspondent-banking-report-to-G20-Summit.pdf ]and the  http://m.b5z.net/i/u/6126465/f/Correspondent_Banking_issues_between_regional_and_US_Banks_are_receiving_the_attention_of__the_USAs_National_Security_Council.pdf  Caribbean Associate of Banks [ http://m.b5z.net/i/u/6126465/f/Correspondent_Banking_issues_between_regional_and_US_Banks_are_receiving_the_attention_of__the_USAs_National_Security_Council.pdf ], among others. We are not alone in this predicament.      
         
    After utilizing several non-direct USD clearing mechanisms, EPB Management is no longer confident in the reliability of these USD relationships long-term and have decided to better service our EUR, GBP, JPY and other currencies.   
 We acknowledge that these frequent changes are impacting the service level for our clients as customer service and operational resources are being used disproportionately to handle USD-related difficulties. Again, we recognize this can be disruptive and we hope that you, as a valued partner, understand this decision was evaluated with our complete attention and consideration.   
 Currently, we have ongoing dialogue with many large correspondent banks that are reviewing our application for USD relationships. We are also in the process of applying for other major financial licenses in an effort to ensure a USD route will be available.      
    Moving Forward   
 We appreciate your patience and support as the offshore banking environment continues to evolve. We are confident that these adjustments are in the best long-term interest of our clients, ultimately resulting in a better banking experience in the form of higher levels of service, increased security and a broadened range of products.   
 We aim to resume full service USD transactions in the near future. Until then, we recommend the EUR as a widely used and accessible alternative.
