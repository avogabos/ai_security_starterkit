Hi Nadya,

 

I have spoken to Companies House, regarding the back dated change in
registered address of the following readymade company. 

 

COMMERCE APPLIED LTD

 

Companies house has confirmed that the change in registered office address
cannot be back dated. We can submit the form to change the address but it
will effective as of the date of submission.

 

Please confirm if you would like me to proceed with the filing of the change
of address form.

 

Await your reply in this regard.

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael
