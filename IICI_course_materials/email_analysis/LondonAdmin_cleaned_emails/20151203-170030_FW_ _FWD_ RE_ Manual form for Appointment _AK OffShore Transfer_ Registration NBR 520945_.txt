Hi Felix,

 

Regarding what is required by Andre Knott to complete the Off Shore company work and eMail that you sent to his assistant Nicole Messina.

 

I have re attached the bank transfer confirmation, please confirm that this has been received and all is in order.

 

 

With regard to your last correspondence with Nicole, could you please provide clarity on what it is you actually need.

This is how we understand what it is you you are requesting.

 

-Notarized Personal Bank Statements, 1 - 3 Months

-Notarized Personal Bank Statements, 1 - 6 Months

 

The second part of your request,

'He will also need to provide the information that was sent to him by me from the bank in regards to his business.' 

Andre advises that he has never received any information from you from the bank in regards to his business?

Also, if you already have this why do we need to send it back to you?

OR 

If we need to do something here, please re send this information and advise what it is we actually are required to do with it.

Would this also need to be notarized?

 

 

Is there anything else Andre needs to provide?

 

 

Felix, we need your response on these matters as soon as possible.

 

 

Thank you & Regards

Mark Bartolo

Hi Felix,

 

Attached are the screen prints of the transfer process for balance of funds for Andre Knott.

 

"AK OffShore 3.jpg" is the final step which shows the 'Receipt for international transfer'.

I hope that is all the information you need for proof of transfer.

 

Thanks & Regards

Mark Bartolo
