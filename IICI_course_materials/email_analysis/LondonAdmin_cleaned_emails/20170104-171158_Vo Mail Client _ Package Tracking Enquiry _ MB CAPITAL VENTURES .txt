Dear Steve,

 

Happy new year!

 

I am attaching something that was sent to our office address at Harley street it has been signed for and it was never forwarded to me as well as an envelope from De Grisogono jewelry one month ago.

 

Please be kind enough to tell me who received my items and why have I not been notified? I thought that everything received would be forwarded to me at home in Faringdon. I am paying for his service right???

 

Thank you in advance. 

 

Best regards,

 

Maria
