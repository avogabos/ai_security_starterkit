Dear Nadya,

Not sure how that slipped past me - thanks for resending.


One thing left - I have the older bank statement for Biserka, now I need a recent one from Lloyds.

Nadya,
I spoke to Marc yesterday who is assisting with this application, and the call went well. So far this is a suitable relationship - easy holding and investment account, they can benefit from our Saxo platform, and the transactions seem easy enough to process.
At this time, can you help me clarify these individuals:
SIGNATORIES:
- Biserka
- Dimitar
SHAREHOLDERS:
-
??
- ??
DIRECTORS:

Next, I'm ready for all remaining documentation.
See checklist attached

Dear Vincent,
We had discussed this client a few months ago. They are intending to use your share management platform in the future.
Please find attached certified ID for DIMITROVA, Biserka, the pre-approval form and certified company docs for the BVI company WILDWOOD LIMTIED.
The corporate forms I will send in another email along with the ID of the second Director DIMIROV, Dimitar.
Kind regards
Nadya
