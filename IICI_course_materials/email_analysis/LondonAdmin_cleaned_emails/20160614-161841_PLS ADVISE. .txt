Hi, one of my client wants to transfer 6 UK companies to us and he has paid
GBP 2550 (GBP 425 for each company) for reg address, accounting and online
company admin.

 

He is requesting us to collect the identification documents of the company
owners from his previous accountants office as the accountant is not
providing docs by email.

 

Is is possible for us to arrange a courier to pick the docs? Customer will
pay us the courier cost.

 

Pls advise. Thanks
