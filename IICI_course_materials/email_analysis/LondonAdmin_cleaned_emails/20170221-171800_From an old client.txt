Hello dear Formations House team,

 

Lambert Akademie Ltd. (Pfundstadt, Germany) told me, that they send a parcel
with software

to the (old) adress of 29 Harley Street in London in the beginning of
February

(some years ago I was a client of Formations House).

 

Can you check out in your office if there has arrived something by postal
service

from Lambert Akademie adressed to Quadrato Fine Art Editions or Jens
Spreckelsen?

 

And if, can you tell me the costs to send it back to my current adress in
Austria:

 

Jens Spreckelsen

Ziedlergasse 12 /App 5

1230 Wien

Austria


Thank you very much for your help.

Jens v. Spreckelsen
marketing coach
