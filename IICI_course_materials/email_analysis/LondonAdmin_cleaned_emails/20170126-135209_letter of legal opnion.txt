We need a solicitor to write a letter stating

The company fairway carslisle with company no and registered at . , in
accordance with the laws of Seychelles, has no impedence or legal restraint
from the purchase of property in any international location including United
Kingdom.

 

Get quote from AC management, the wording doesn't have to be exactly that as
we will get specific workding from the customer shortly, but its to that
effect

 

Whatsapp me the quote from the before telling billy the price for the
letter, as I will decided what to charge, typically though take the value in
dollars and make into gbp and then double it

So if they charge 250usd, charge him 500gbp
