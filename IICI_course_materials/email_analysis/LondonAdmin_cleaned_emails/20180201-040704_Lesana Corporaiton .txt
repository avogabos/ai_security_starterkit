Dear Prisca, Nellianne,

Please could you kindly update us on the renewal date for Lesana Corporaiton Ltd ?

I have also sent you a few emails regarding new incorporations but with no success to the info@mayfair-offshore.com<mailto:info@mayfair-offshore.com>. Perhaps you could check your spam/junk folders?

I will now also resend to your emails from this email address and hopefully you will receive.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
