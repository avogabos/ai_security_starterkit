Dear Madam

Re: ORDO REAL ESTATE LIMITED        No.8666114

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file the following documents, fees and late filing penalties:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual return for 28 August 2014, with a filing fee of £40.00.

3) Accounts for the period ending 31 August 2014. There are no late filing penalties for the later accounts as they became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

5) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1


Yours faithfully
