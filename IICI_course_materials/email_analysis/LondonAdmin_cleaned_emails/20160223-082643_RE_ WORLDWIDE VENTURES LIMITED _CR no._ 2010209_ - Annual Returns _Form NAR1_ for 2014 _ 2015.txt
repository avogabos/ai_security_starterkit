Dear Nadya,

 

I discussed this with our Compliance Officer, and have been suggested to
pass your request to our Company Secretary department to handle.  I also
discussed with Angela, the Director of OLN Corporate Services Limited.
She will assist you to file the said Annual Return and will contact you
directly, I copy this email to her.

 

I received the original ARs, I will pass them to Angela for her further
handling.

Dear Nelly,

 

We require your services in paper filling the Annual Returns for WORLDWIDE
VENTURES LIMITED as we do not have the authentication code for this
company.

 

The return that we submitted by post (year 2014-2015) has been rejected by
HK registry, we assumed that we would have been billed for it afterwards.
In any case we are unable to make this payment as the Registry have stated
the following:

 

For overseas payers, a bank draft in Hong Kong Dollars made payable to
"Companies Registry" and drawn on a licensed bank in Hong Kong is
required.

 

We currently cannot acquire this at the moment and this is a matter of
urgency. 

 

We need to pay $3,480HKD for the 2014 Annual Return and $870HKD for the
2015 Annual Return.

 

Please would you be able to kindly file this for us and make the payment
on our behalf this time?

 

I am sending you the correct signed original documents out today, I hope
you will receive by Monday/Tuesday if you could you kindly send us an
invoice with the additional fees we will make the payment straight away. 

 

Please note I will be out of the office on Monday and back on Tuesday. 

 

Thank you for your assistance. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
