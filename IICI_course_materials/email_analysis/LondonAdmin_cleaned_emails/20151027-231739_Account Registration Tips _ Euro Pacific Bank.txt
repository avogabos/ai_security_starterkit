Registration Tips 
To minimize account opening delays 
pay attention to these two crucial account registration tips      
 
          
 
   


1) When completing an online application 
use your client's e-mail address 


Why? 
This will ensure that the client receives our Welcome Email once the account is activated. The Welcome Email contains important information regarding wire transfer instructions, how to order a debit card, etc.      
 
   


2) Include your company name in the field 
"How did you hear about the bank?" 


Why? 
We want to ensure that your company is acknowledged for each referred account.
