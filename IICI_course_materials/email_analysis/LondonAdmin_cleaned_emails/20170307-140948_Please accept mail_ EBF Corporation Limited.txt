Dear Danielle,

 

I hope all is well with you.

 

EBF Corporation Limited

Customer ID: 78623212

 

Please accept all mail coming for the above company. The customer has
informed that they have paid us 275 GBP for mail forwarding upgrade order
for mail forwarding 12 months. I have requested them to provide us the
payment proof. They are expecting a document from a bank in the name Natasha
Aggarwal (Director of EBF Corporation Ltd).

 

Once the payment proof is provided, I will then place an upgrade order.

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael
