Dear Gareth,

 

Still not showing this morning, but as I mentioned I like by end of today.
We spoke with CH and as thought they don't allow any letter or document to
be loaded even if posted to explain, simply what is in the 2nd page of the
accounts should suffice. Your chartered accountants can however issue an
official letter if you needed to provide to a 3rd party.

 

Thanks

Hi Gareth

 

Ill see if they allow us to, but in the revised accounts we posted there is
a statement to say its because there were additional transactions not
included in the previous accounts, 

Thanks
