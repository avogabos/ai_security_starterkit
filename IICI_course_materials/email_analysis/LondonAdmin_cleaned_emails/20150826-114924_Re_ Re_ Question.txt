?Nadya,


I'll wait for Michael's contact. There probably won't be much we can do for him because we're a reseller ourselves, so we can't extend our white label relationship that we have with our MasterCard supplier, to another person, i.e. We can't issue a white label on our white label, as our contract doesn't allow


That's why I asked if it was going to be for payroll use.


I'm happy to talk to him anyway, and he's likely going to have to reach out to a debit card supplier directly and get a white label. If he has a substantial amount of cards we can try to refer him to our supplier.


Keep you posted.



Regards,

Nadya,

I can host that call. You can introduce me via email and then I can set up a call or you can give them my direct as I am currently in Asia - +66894472452.

Do you know if they are a reseller of cards or are these payroll cards to pay individuals who did some sort of labor for the client?
