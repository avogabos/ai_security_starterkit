Hi Nadya,

Thanks for the documents. Please see below:


1. Now I received Ms. Cui's passport signature page, noticed that signature on the Bank Contract doesn't match with the signature on the passport. The compliance will verify the signature with the passport copy, so the client will need to re-sign the Bank Contract in Chinese.


2. Ms. Cui's statement only dated back to June, we will need the statement in May. However I can wait for a couple of days, submit the account in December then it will suffice.


3. I will be waiting for the Memorandum copies.


4. I did receive the Bank Contract, what I didn't receive is the signed Corporate Resolution - https://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_corporate_resolution_template.doc

Hi Nadya,
Thanks for the documents. I noticed:
1. Mr. Liang's notarized passport copy is out dated, it was back in March. Document certifications for individuals should be dated within 90 days of submission.
2. Ms. Cui's notarized passport copy doesn't contain the page that has her signature on it.
3. Mr. Liang's HSBC bank statement only dated back to July, we will also need the older statement that's older than 6 months from the same account.
4. Ms. Cui's bank statement is also the same situation as point 3, we will also need the older statement that's older than 6 months from the same account.
5. We also need the rest of pages copies for Memorandum.
6. I didn't receive the signed Corporate Resolution -

Do let me know if I missed anything.
