Dear Nadya,
We can arrange a translation into English from these email copies and you 
can bring in the originals without the need for an appointment.
Would you like me to find out the costs first?  Do you need a simple 
translation or a certified translation?
Best regards,

Dear Rosanna, 
  
Thank you for your assistance with dealing with our client Mr. Treadwell 
last Friday. I presume he paid you directly? 
  
Our usual notary is at Hartwig Notaries in One Heddon Street, Piccadilly. 
However, we may from time to time require your services for French 
documents or if there is a back log work, would that be possible? 
  
Also, do you support any other languages? 
  
I look forward to hearing from you.
