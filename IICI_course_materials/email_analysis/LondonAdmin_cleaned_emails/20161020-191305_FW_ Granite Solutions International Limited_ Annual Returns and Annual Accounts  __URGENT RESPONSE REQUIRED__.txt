and documents have bee rejected by Companies House. They are stating that
Yair Hamami was not the director at the time of annual returns(Jan 2013) &
Mr Cornelis Willem Frederik was the sole director at that time.

 

Similarly, Mr Cornelis Willem Frederik is also the director along with Yair

Dear Cristina,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note that the company restoration is in process. As I previously
advised the restoration process takes about 2-4 weeks time as it is done
manually and paper work & forms etc are submitted which are checked,
assessed and approved by the concerned departments at Companies House and
the company is then restored.

 

We will contact Companies House and will update you regarding it.

Dear Sarah, 

 

Please find attached the forms - please note that I will send 2 emails as
the files are too big. 

 

Kindly note that on the Annual returns on page 8 I edited the name of Yair
Hamami as he was written as Yasir.

until the company will be restored? 

 

Looking forward to your email.
