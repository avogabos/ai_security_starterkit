Hi Charlotte,
I need your help with EPB, because I have (with other consultants) to get some important consultancy fees coming from 2 DOA Agreements signed in last few days.
I sent the 2 DOA Agreements to EPB, but Mr Ashe Withener (Head Business Consultant) yesterday wrote me this email:-----------------------Hi Stefano – Thank you for the information, but we are not interested in facilitating such transactions.  We are not comfortable with the type of financial transaction nor the size.  Best,
