Subject: Recently rejected application due to jurisdiction - Euro Pacific Bank
From: Matthew Kellmer <mkellmer@europacbank.com>
To: "londonadmin@formationshouse.com" <londonadmin@formationshouse.com>

Hi Nadya,


Our compliance department informed me that we recently turned down an account introduced by Formations House due to connections with The Gambia. I wanted to note that the jurisdiction is currently on our list of prohibited countries, thus not allowing us to place the account.


Do you have any questions about this restriction or would you like to discuss?


Hope all is well, thanks Nadya.
