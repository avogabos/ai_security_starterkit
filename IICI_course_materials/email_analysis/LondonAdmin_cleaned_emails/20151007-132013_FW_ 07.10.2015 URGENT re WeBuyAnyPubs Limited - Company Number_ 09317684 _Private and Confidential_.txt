Felix,

 

I need you to amend documents accordingly as per my email please that I sent yesterday. As initial documents were not all correct.

 

If you could revert back with amended and scanned ASAP that would be much appreciated.

 

Best wishes,

 

Kevin

Hi Felix,

 

Thank you for your email and email from support team.

 

I have following questions and queries and require response ASAP.

 

Some of the enclosed documents are correct, however some are not and require correction before all originals are sent to me.

Please refer to my original email of 1st of October 2015.

 

1. TM01 is correct 

2. AP01 is correct

3. J30 Stock Transfer is not signed. This needs to be signed on page 1 and page 2 please by transferor. Do not date this document. Please re sent.

4. Code is OK

5. Incorporation docs are fine with 1 share issued in the company.

6. Option to tax building and land - Do you have any correspondence from HMRC with that regard?

7. VAT number - do you have it?

8. Corporation Tax Reference should be with you as this is issued by HMRC upon setting up company.

9. Updated Trust document - can you let me know as to why on page 1 there are 1000 ordinary shares rather then 1 share as per companies house?

10. Any other documents?

 

If you could revert to me back with amended documents ASAP and further information as per above please.

 

If you could scan amended as requested for approval before sending all documents in the post.

 

Best wishes,

 

Kevin
