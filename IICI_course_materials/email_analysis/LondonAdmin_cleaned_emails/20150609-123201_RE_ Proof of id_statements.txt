Dear Peter

The bank has also requested this information we need it by the end of the week.

1.       New Bank statement notarized- Dated within the last 3 months

2.       Older bank statement notarized- Dated between 3-6 Months.

We need this dropped into office by the end of the week. Alternatively you could scan these documents to us.

Thanks, Tahir
