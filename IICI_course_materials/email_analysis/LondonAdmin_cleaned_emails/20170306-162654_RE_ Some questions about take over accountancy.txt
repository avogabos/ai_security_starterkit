Yes,

It was mamaged and then the custome rno longer wanted it but as it was barely used we decided to sell it as a RM, so we will need to file some accounts, 

They should be filed like we do active no profit

 

With the other rms, when we sell them we need to ensure we file the accounts for the period where we still owned it

Thanks
