Dear Rachel,

 

we have already asked our management department, if you would like us to help and go to the Eastern Magistrates' Courts and pay for the penalty, there will be HKD $500 service fee.

 

If this is okay for you, then we will issue invoice for your settlement, thank you!

 

Best Regards,

 

Diva Sze
