Charlotte/Nadya,

 

Can you please confirm if Marc can use the account that he purchased. He keeps calling and wants to know when it will be transferred.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

I just want to know if we can invoice clients already in Euro's with the existing RBS account. I wait urgently for that.

 

Regards
