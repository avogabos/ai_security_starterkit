Dear Nadya,

As we are the Notary Public, if you need the service from our Company Secretary department, I could forward your email to them and they will give you their quotation for the same.

What we did before is just assist to submit your signed Instrument and bought and sold notes to Company Registry in Hong Kong.

Regards,
Nelly

Dear Nelly,

Just following up on the email I sent you earlier, would you be able to help us? It is quite an urgent matter.

We would like to add a new shareholder and increase shares of the company:
USD 60000 shares to Mr. Faisal Almutairi

Please could you kindly advise us on the process.

I look forward to hearing from you.
