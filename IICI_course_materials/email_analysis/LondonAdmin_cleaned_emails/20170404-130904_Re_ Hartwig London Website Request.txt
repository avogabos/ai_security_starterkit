Dear Ms Crawford,

we have now moved.  

We will temporarily be located until 30 April 2017 at Southside, 105 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6QT, just opposite Westminster City Hall, before we finally move to our new offices in 22a St. James’s Square, London SW1Y 4JH on 1 May 2017.

Our new telephone number is 020 3457 2690. Appointments have to be made one day in advance as I have to notify ground floor reception of all visitors expected the following day.  

I confirm the appointment for 10.30 am tomorrow. 

Kind regards

Trying to get through to Mr. Kuhn on 0207 470 7131 however message is "sorry the number you are trying to call does not exist" - please advise as we need to Notarise a set of UK company documents and then go to the FCO. 
I look forward to hearing from you.
