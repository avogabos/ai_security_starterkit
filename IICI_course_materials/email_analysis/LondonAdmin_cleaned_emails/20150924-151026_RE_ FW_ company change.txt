Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hi Felix 

 

We would like to change our company status from company with VAT number to company without. But as i know Trading Global Services Ltd. has no Vat registered anyway right? As we wrote invoices over Accounts Center. 

 

Let me know if this information is right.

 

Thanks
