Dear Nadia,
 
 
I have already interviewed Frederic on the phone. He is a very kind man.
 
I have submitted the application to our Compliance team and unfortunately, it was declined as a result of their internal review process.


Kindly note that several African nations where Mr. Frederic works in and intends to send money to and from are restricted for us, therefore we cannot help.


Thank you for considering Euro Pacific Bank Ltd for your business.
 
 
Kind regards,
