Hi Feli,

Sorry for the late response. I was really busy and I didn't manage to send this document earlier.

Everything is sign up and filled up.

What is the estimate time when I will have a response ?

Also is the billing address of this bank account going to be the one that you provide for my company ?

Best Wishes,

Ventsislav
