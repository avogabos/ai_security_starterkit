The bank has come back to us…

 

Ms. Cui's, noticed that signature on the Bank Contract doesn't match with the signature on the passport. The compliance will verify the signature with the passport copy, so the client will need to re-sign the Bank Contract in Chinese.

 

I didn't receive is the signed Corporate Resolution - https://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_corporate_resolution_template.doc
