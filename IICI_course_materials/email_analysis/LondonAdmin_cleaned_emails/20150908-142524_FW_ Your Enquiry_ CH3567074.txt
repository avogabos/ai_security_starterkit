Dear Sir 

Re - GUARANTEESEU LIMITED 08857259 

Thank you for your enquiry. 

If the above company is required on the Register, you can apply for it to be
Administratively Restored.  To proceed with this process, Companies House
will require the following documents:- 
1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. This form can be obtained from the
Companies House web site www.gov.uk/companieshouse 

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter. Information regarding this can be obtained from the
B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - www.gov.uk/bonavacantia 

3) Annual Return form for the year ending  
23/01/2015 with filing fee of £40 
This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site
www.gov.uk/companieshouse 

4) Please note Accounts for the period ending 31/01/2015, will be due by
23/10/2015.  If the company is not restored by 23/10/2015, these Accounts
will need to be filed, as part of the restoration application. 

Having checked our records, as the above company was struck of the Register,
prior to filing the Accounts for 2015 no late filing penalty would been
generated, upon its Restoration. 

Yours faithfully 

Mr P. Stacey
