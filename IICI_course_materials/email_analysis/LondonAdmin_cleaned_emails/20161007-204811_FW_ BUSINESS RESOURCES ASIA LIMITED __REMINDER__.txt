Dear Sarah,

 

Thank you for your email. 

Did you send the copy of his account statement and certificate of bank balance to the bank? We need their comments TO MAKE 100% SURE TO TRANSFER THE SIGNER TO THE NEW DIRECTOR WHEN HE ACTUALLY TRAVELS FROM JAPAN TO UK. Otherwise, this is just wasting time and money. If the bank judges he is not acceptable, you need to tell that to us first to avoid his meaningless traveling to UK.

We really need your help.

 

 

We look forward to your reply.

 

Thanks and Best Regards,

 




Asami Yamada
