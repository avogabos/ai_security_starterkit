Hi Emily,

Re: E.E HEALTH LTD

100 GBP is for the registered address at Harley Street for a year
25 GBP is for the Online Company Administrator – so we can file your statement online
15 GBP (this is a government filing fee) is to file your Confirmation Statement at Companies House which is now OVERDUE please see screen shot below.

So you need to pay 140GBP now.

Please can you look at the list of SIC codes attached and give me what suits your company activities best so we can provide when filing your statement.

The cost of name change is 25GBP did you still want us to proceed with that today?

Regarding your Accounts/Tax filing you will need to file for the period 25th March 2016 – 31st March 2017

The deadline to file dormant accounts will be 25th Dec 2017

The cost for filing at Companies House and HMRC is 75GBP

Kind regards
Nadya
