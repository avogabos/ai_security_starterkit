Dear Customer,

 

Please find attached the Apostille page of the company documents that we
have collected from Taiwanese Embassy. 

 

However, please note that the legalization application has been rejected by
the Chinese Embassy as it says his nationality is Taiwanese and they do not
recognise it. Please advise.

 

We look forward to hear from you.

 

Best Regards,

 

Sarah
