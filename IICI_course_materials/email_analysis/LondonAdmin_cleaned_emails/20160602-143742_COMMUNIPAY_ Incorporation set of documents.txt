Hello
I would like the documents sent to Latvia, as this has been too 
problematic and I need the documents as soon as possible.
Please post to my bankers address which I have now given to you three 
times and confirm documents have been sent with a tracking number.

I will transfer whatever payment you need to send to Latvia as well as 
the 8.35 for the other. Please confirm total amount due and I will make 
one transfer/payment.
Thanks
Fred
