Hi Nadya,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm touching base as our banking staff informed me that the application for Mr. Eugene Coker (Totsworldwide) has been suspended due to the Account Manager being unable to get in touch. Do you know if the client is still interested in pursuing the account?

Thanks in advance, Nadya.
