Hello,

 

Company Name: GUARANTEESEU LIMITED

 

This company is registered on our address. So client is asking for HMRC
letter which has the "Tax Reference Number".

 

This letter is not available in the accounts folder.

 

Therefore could you please check in your records and let me know if the
letter is still available?

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

 

Thank you
