Hi Nadya,
I hope this finds you well?
I have resent this email to you, as I have not heard anything from you for a couple of months, so if you would be so kind as to give me an update I would appreciate it.

I am following up on our previous communication back on June (a while after being appointed to the last position), with regards to appointing me to a new position. But, as yet, I have heard nothing from you for a couple of months.

Was I taken off as NED for the last position? Or am I still listed as such? If you could let me know whether you have any further positions available & any further opportunities, as per our previous email discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you,
Many thanks and Kindest
Violet Heale
