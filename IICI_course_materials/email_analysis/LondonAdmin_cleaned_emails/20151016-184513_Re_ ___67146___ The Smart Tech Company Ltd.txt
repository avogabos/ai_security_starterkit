Hi Nadya,

Thanks for the application. There isn't much information about Incoming and Outgoing payments, can you please ask the client to tell us more about the economic purposes of transactions? An economic purpose is the original reason for your incoming or outgoing payment:

What product or service did the sender buy from you?
What product or service did you buy from the beneficiary?


Can the client also provide us his online references, CV or related business relationships agreements or contracts for us to review and verify the business activity?

Best regards,
