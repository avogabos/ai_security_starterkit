Dear Danielle,

 

I hope all is well with you.

 

CASSIA TRADE Ltd
Customer ID: 6108852

 

The mail manager shows we have 5 pending mails for the company which have
not been sent out, the mail dates back to 28-11-2016. Please confirm if the
mail has been sent. The customer called and informed us and was disappointed
as previously the mails had been sent out later.

 

Awaiting your reply in this regard.

 

Thanks,

 

Michael
