Hello Support

YES, I have found out and got my mail from the post office after spending 3
hours of my time looking for it.

Problem was you send the mail to my old address even you had the new address
that was updated in the system

I can see the new address information on my account has now been deleted,
properly because you messed it up ;o)

Please make sure ONLY to send to my new address below and add it for me in
your system as your system of cause is not working as it never do LOL (see
attachment) 

NEW ADDRESS

Tobias Mick Pjedsted
VN Residence 2 (C-237)
359/186 Moo. 12 
Pratamnak, Soi 5
Nongprue , Banglamung 
Chonburi 20150
Thailand

BTW, I have for the last 10 years told you to get new developers, dont use
people from India or Pakistan as they can do the job so your site will work 

I can help you, it will be expensive but you will get then best website in
the world when I am done :o)) Just let me know if you have a big budget and
we can talk :o))

CONFIRM when my address has been updated in system

Sincerely,
