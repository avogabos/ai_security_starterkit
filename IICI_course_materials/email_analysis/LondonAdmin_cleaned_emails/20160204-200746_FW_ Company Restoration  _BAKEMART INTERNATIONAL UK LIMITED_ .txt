Our Ref: REST/6807488/CES 
Date: 13 January 2016 

Dear Sir 

BAKEMART INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED 

Thank you for your e-mail dated 11 January 2016. 

I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved because the annual return for 2 February 2015 remained outstanding despite a number of letters being issued to the company at the address listed on our records as the registered office address, including one sent via recorded delivery.  As we do not appear to have received a response, the Registrar of Companies had no choice but to believe that this company was no longer required and as such take action which led to this company being struck off the register. 

I can also confirm that the following documents and fees are required in order to apply for this company to be administratively restored to the register: 

Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website. 

Accounts for the period(s) 28 February 2015. 

These accounts will not incur late filing penalties as they became due after this company was struck off the register. 

Annual Return(s) (form(s) AR01) for 2 February 2015. This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40 and can also be downloaded from our website. 

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64. 

I hope this information has been of some use to you. 

Yours faithfully 

C E Street (Ms)
