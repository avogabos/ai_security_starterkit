Hi Angela

 

To confirm I have still yet receive the corporate documents from Formation House, could you please ask them to send them through.  Also regarding the bank statements they are not CREDIT CARD statements are they?  As mentioned before the bank does not accept CREDIT CARD statements.

 

Thank you,

 

Regards,
