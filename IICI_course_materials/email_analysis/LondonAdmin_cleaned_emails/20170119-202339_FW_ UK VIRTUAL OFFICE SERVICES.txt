Hi Sarah,

 

Thank you for the phone call today. We are looking for a location in Harley
Street and got a few options.

 

On the phone I understood that you will charge us £50 set up fee, £25 per
month for phone/fax and £25 for mailing. We would need to pay for 3 months
in advance. Is that correct?

 

We are happy to sign up immediately but dont want initially to be tied up
with a company before we see their performance over a period of time.

 

Also, I saw that you rent the room for £25, I wanted to see the room and
also see what would be the cost for 2 or 3 hours? Also cost for weekends?
Can we see patients after 5pm?

 

Regards,

Ben Z Lauren  07799557403
