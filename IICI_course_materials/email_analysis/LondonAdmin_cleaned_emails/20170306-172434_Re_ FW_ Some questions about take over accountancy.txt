Dear Marc,
Please kindly see attached accounts for your perusal. Please confirm and we will file straight away.
After filing Companies House will issue a penalty which you will have to pay for late filing. They send a letter to the registered address so we will scan and email this over to you.
I think it will be about 150GBP.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya

Dear Nadya, gd afternoon
Our new accountant Sable International wants to know:
1.They need to send a letter of professional clearance to the old accountants in order to take over from them. Please provide their company name and contact details.
2. According to Companies House, next set of accounts made up to 31/05/2016 is due by close of business today. Please kindly advise whether the previous accountants have filed the year accounts made up to 31/05/2016 already, or will file this return?
