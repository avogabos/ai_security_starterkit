Dear Sarah,

 

Please find the translation of the account statement attached.

 

 

So we need to ask our client to have the copies of his passport and utility bill notarized only?

 

As we confirmed regarding the bank logo on bank certificate, in Japan, companies do not put its logo (trademark) on the official statement in common. Please tell over that to the bank. So he need tol prepare for the certificate of bank balance for Mitsui Sumitomo Bank as well?

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,




Asami Yamada

Dear Sarah,



Thank you for your reply.

Please find the translation of his account statement attached. Is there any spelling error? The title is 'Savings Ledger'.

Translators do not attach such seals and signature on documents. Should our client get them notarized instead? Please confirm.

We look forward to hearing from you.

 Best Regards,

Asami Yamada

Dear Asami,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note that your client can bring the Bank Statement and the certified translation of the document. As advised, the original bank statements usually have bank logo on it and it is printed on the letterhead of the Bank. The director can explain it to the bank and can also provide the ‘Certificate of Bank Balance’ which will also confirm his bank account details.

 

Regarding Translation, please note that normally when a document is translated the ‘original document’ and the ‘certified translation’ is folded down together, stapled, and the seal and signature placed over it.  It is Certified by a publically-certified translator for that specific language and contain the translator’s seal and attestation confirmation. The seal must also indicate the language for which the translator is officially certified. 

 

I hope above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or assistance, please feel free to E-mail.

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,
