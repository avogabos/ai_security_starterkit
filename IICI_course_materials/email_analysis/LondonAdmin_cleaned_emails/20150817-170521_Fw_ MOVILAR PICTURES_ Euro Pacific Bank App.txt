Hi Nadya,


Can you work with Ashe?


He'll provide you some feedback shortly and will tell you what the next steps.


I recommend that you register the client and allow the client to go through Pre-Approval before sending us the full docs over.


https://secure.europacbank.com/register.php? Please write "Formations House / Vincent Le" in the "How did you hear about us?" section of the form.


Film-related companies are generally lower risk.



Regards,
