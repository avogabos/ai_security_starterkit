Dear Sarah,

 

Have you received a reply from the bank regarding the account statement?

As we mentioned before, Japanese banks do not usually issue a bank statement in English. A few of them might issue that but at least Mitsui Sumitomo bank do not issue it translated into English.

Japanese banks do issue the certificate of bank balance in English.

 

We look forward to hearing from you very soon.

 

Best Regards,

Asami Yamada
