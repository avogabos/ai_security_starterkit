Dear Madam 

company number: 
07668094 
company name: 
CLOUDBIZ ASIA LIMITED 

Thank you for your email concerning the above company.  As the company was
struck off voluntarily by the directors, the company can only be restored by
Court Order. 

A company may be restored to the register on receipt of an Order of Court.
However, in order to commence action, which would lead to an Order being
granted, an application would need to be submitted.  This application would
consist of a Claim Form CPR (Part 8) which would need to be sealed by a
court, and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim,
why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the
restoration. 

You can obtain further advice on how to restore a company by logging onto
the Treasury Solicitors website  www.gov.uk and downloading their notes for
guidance on company restoration. 

Therefore, if you wish to take further action to restore this company, you
will need to apply for an Order of Court to restore it to the register, as
this is the only way a company can be restored to the register in these
circumstances. 

The following documents and payments will be required if the company is
being restored to trade. 

Annual returns for the years 06/09/2014 and 06/09/2015 with filing fees of
£80 

Accounts for the period ending 30/06/2014 and 30/06/2015 

There are no late filing penalties. 

Yours faithfully 

Catherine Powell
