Hi Wade,

I hope you are well.

We a have client who before applying for a corporate business account with yourselves would like to see a financial report/capitalisation of the bank but cannot seem to find any information online.

Would you be able to provide this?

Also would you have an updated list of restricted business activities and or countries that you could send me before I send any applications over. We now have a few pending and just wanted to double check.

When filling out the online registration on behalf of the client is there anywhere to ensure that it goes through us the referral first so that client will not need to do the work that we have already done? Is there another link for this?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
