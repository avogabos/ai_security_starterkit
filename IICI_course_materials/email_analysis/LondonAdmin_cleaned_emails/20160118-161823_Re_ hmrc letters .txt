Hi Nadya

 

The penalty for Accounts Centre UK LTD has been levied because the
Corporation Tax Return is not submitted or was submitted late. I don't have
record of this company so can't tell you exact situation.

 

Also, VAT returns has already been e-filed for Accounts Centre and the
assessed amount has been waived off.
