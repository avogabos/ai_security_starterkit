Hi

For the Cogs its £120, or £150 for next day

Then we have to get the documents apostilled – 4/5 day service is £150, but we can do an express for £300

UAE certification is per page, but we can do it per doc, which is 4 parts, apostile cover, Inc cert, M&A, COGS. Its £425 each, plus our fee of £50. Can take 1 week. 

We would try and do it all as fast as possible though

Thanks

 

CP
