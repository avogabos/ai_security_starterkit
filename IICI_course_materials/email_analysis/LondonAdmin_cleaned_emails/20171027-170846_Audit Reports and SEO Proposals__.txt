Subject: Audit Reports and SEO Proposals!!

Hi,

Hope you are doing well!

I am from a digital marketing company. We’d like to draw your attention
to a very crucial issue regarding your website. It will be really high-
yielding if you address the issue.

Your website is awesome so far as designing part is concerned. However,
it doesn’t follow Search Engine Guidelines; as a result, it has a very
low visibility in search results. We’ve done a thorough SEO audit of
your website, and found that it has a big potential to generate more
revenue than what it might be earning at the present. And yes, we have
generated a report for the same as well.

We’d be glad to share the SEO audit report with you so that you can
check it yourself and find out what should be done to make it SEO
friendly.

If you are interested in knowing more about online marketing
methodologies and how we can help you realize the true potential of
your site, Please share your contact details (Phone, Skype) so that we
can discuss the growth opportunity for your business by making your
website SEO friendly.

Thanks!!
Jannifer Scott
Business Development Executive
