Changes to Generic Card Policy
Generic Cards Discontinued
Due to recent changes in the Compliance process,
we are unable to provide generic cards going forward.
Dear Partners,
Due to recent changes in the Compliance process, please note we are unable to provide generic cards going forward.
All cards ordered must be done so using the same process but illustrating the cardholder name, date of birth, and address on the cards. If the cards are for business then clients must also add the company name on the 4th line embossing.
Why did the policy change?
The reason for the change is to ensure we are complying with the scheme rules in addition to regulatory Anti-Money Laundering requirements and to protect all parties.
If you have any questions about these developments, please don't hesistate to contact us at
affiliates@europacbank.com
Sincerely,
The Business Development Team at Euro Pacific Bank
