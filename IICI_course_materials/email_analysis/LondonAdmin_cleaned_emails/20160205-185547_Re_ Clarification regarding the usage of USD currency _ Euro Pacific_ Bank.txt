Hi Matt,

Thank you for your email. Our client Henry Weber Limited, is asking for contact details of Euro Pacific to discuss their brokerage and investment service which allow USD wire transfers.

Would I be able to pass on your details or would you prefer if I gave you theirs?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
Nadya

USD Clarification

Clarification regarding the usage of USD currency


Dear Partner

In last week's email we announced that Euro Pacific Bank is no longer accepting USD wires.

To clarify, we are no longer accepting USD incoming wires for corporate accounts, instead we request that all clients invoice in EUR, GBP, JPY or any of our other currency offerings.


Corporate clients may open a FREE non-USD bank account by sending a request to the banking staff via an internal bank message.

To prevent confusion, we will only be distributing USD wire instructions to personal account clientele who wish to take advantage of our brokerage and investment services.
