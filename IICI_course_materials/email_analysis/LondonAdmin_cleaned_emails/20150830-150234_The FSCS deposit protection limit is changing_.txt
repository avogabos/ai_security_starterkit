The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is a deposit protection scheme that provides a level of cover for your money should anything happen to your bank, building society or credit union. We wanted to let you know that the deposit protection limit is changing from 1 January 2016. This change applies to all banks, building societies and credit unions in the UK.

What's changing

&bull;
For individuals: the level of cover is reducing from &#163;85,000 to &#163;75,000 per bank, building
society or credit union

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&bull;
For joint account holders: each account holder will have a level of cover up to &#163;75,000

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&bull;
For Business, Commercial & Corporate accounts protected by FSCS prior to 3 July 2015 and from that date onwards: the level of cover is reducing from &#163;85,000 to &#163;75,000 per bank, building society or credit union

In addition, from 3 July 2015, eligible deposits of large companies and small local authorities are also eligible for FSCS protection. For these customers the &#163;75,000 deposit protection limit was immediately applicable, since these deposits had not previously been protected.

Please familiarise yourself with FSCS compensation arrangements including information on deposits excluded from protection by reading the information rbs.co.uk/fscs ( http://l.emlex.rbs.co.uk/rts/go2.aspx?t=3618&tp=i-H43-8X-9O-2vYt-1n-2vaU-1c-2dTG-gOppA ).
