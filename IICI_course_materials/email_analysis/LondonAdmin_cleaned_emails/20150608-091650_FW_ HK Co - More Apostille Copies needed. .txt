Hi Charlotte, 

 

Nice to see you briefly on Friday. I forgot to ask - when you’re in the office tomorrow, do you mind asking Alfred Ip to prepare 3 more copies of the Apostille for our HK company - same as he prepared before. Please ask him to courier them to your office so I can pick them up asap. I seem to need them quite urgently. 

 

If he/ you can email me copies in the meantime, that would be helpful (I don’t seem to have the final versions). 

 

Please also let me know how much it will cost! 

 

Many thanks!

 

Dai

Hi Charlotte- sorry, not sure if you got my earlier email about booking the front office for our meeting tomorrow morning- 10-12.00. 
Hope that's ok.
Thanks.
