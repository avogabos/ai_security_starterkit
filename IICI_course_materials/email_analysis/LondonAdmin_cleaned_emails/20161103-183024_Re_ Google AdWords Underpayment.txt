Dear Mr Hoare,
Please find included in this email and email received to the Mobile Electrics email address of which you should have been monitoring while still in charge of the company.
As a routine check while the company is in transition, we have noticed that there is an outstanding debt on the company from Google Adwords. You as the director at the time of billing from GoogleAdwords are responsible for clearing this.
Additionally, I have check and the Mobile Electrics Facebook page appears to still be active. You have been requested once more to ensure it is taken down.
As the new owner of the company is having difficulty obtaining the correct ID for the company, I have agreed to take over the company and its bank account in order to absolve you of any further dealings with our company or Ms Pawar.
I will post to the home address listed for you as the director, new forms, which will be part filled and places for signature will be highlighted for you. Please sign where highlighted and return to me at 29 Harley Street, W1G 9QR.
If you have any questions, please contact me directly.
Kind regards
