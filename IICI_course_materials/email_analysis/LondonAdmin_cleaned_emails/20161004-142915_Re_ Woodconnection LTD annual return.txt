Hi Poul,

 

You will need to file your financial accounts for that period before the overdue date otherwise you will incur fines monthly until you file. 

 

We can provide you this service: 

 

Dormant express accounts (if you had no transactions in that period) – £150.00 

 

If you have been trading then you will need to send the transactions for that period and we will prepare and send to you for approval 

 

Value accounting Express - £500.00 we will need at least 14 days to prepare so please do send the asap. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
