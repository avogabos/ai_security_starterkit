Dear Oliver, 

 

Please see in attached Mr Bodini's copy passport and driving licence as proof of address. Please confirm me this documents are ok for you and once you have made all the changes. 

Regarding the bank account, what would we need to do to change the signatories?

 

Many thanks

 

Kind regards, 

 

Pedro

Dear Oliver, 

 

Many thanks for your email. 

Please note that Mr Adrian Nedelcu is already registered with Companies Hosuse as Director and shareholder of Consolidated Media Ltd and that we already see Consolidated Media in our account 

 

We would like this to change to: 

- shareholder: MB Cactus Services Limited

- Director: Mr Matteo Bodini

 

Also we would like to change the signature of the bank account to be the only signatory Mr Bodini. Please see Mr Bodini in cc. 

 

Many thanks 

 

Best regards, 

Pedro

Dear Pedro

 

Sorry, I am away from office with a client meeting

 

We had some issues with House Conversation Ltd

 

So we are striking it off

 

I have reserved Consolidated Media for you 

 

The company is not in your account yet, as you haven’t provided any Director and shareholder for this

 

So I have reserved this for you

 

Whenever you have any client, please send me his information and I will transfer this company and bank account to him

 

Best regards

Dear Oliver, 

 

Many thanks for your email. I am quite confused, maybe you can help me..

If I am not wrong we purchased Conversation House Ltd which had an HSBC account. Hsbc closed the account and I have seen in Companies House that you have applied for a voluntary strike-off. 

You gave us then Consolidation Media Ltd which I think has an HSBC account. We have this company now in our account. 

Can you confirm me all this is correct?could you tell me also who do you have in your records as the beneficial owner?

 

Many thanks

 

Kind regards, 

 

Pedro

Dear Oliver, 

 

I hope this email finds you well. 

I write you because regarding Consolidated Media and House Conversation Ltd. 

I think we should only have Consolidated Media (is the one that has the bank account right?) and no more House Conversation




​Could you update me regarding both companies?

 

Many thanks

 

Kind regards, 

 

Pedro​
