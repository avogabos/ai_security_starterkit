Felix,

Did you get my last email?

P.S. - 

Good morning Felix,

First I would like to thank you for the invitation you were able to reserve on this week, I really appreciate this.
I'm afraid I'm not able to come. I'm not in town on that day because I urgently have to substitute my colleague in Amsterdam on Mdevcon conference for mobile developers this week.
I'm afraid I cannot tell you now when I have time but I will get back to you on next week so we could assign a new appointment date.

Please reply to me after you read this email.

Best wishes,

Oliver
