Hello Nadya,

We have placed the order for extreme accounting for company COMPANY CONSULT LTD, could you please check if Tahir has posted the accounts already? If not could you please post these as soon as possible.

Amended accounts are not yet been updated at Companies House. Kindly confirm and let me know whether they have been posted or not so that I can look further.)
