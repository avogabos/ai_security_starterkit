Ok, tell me when you tell him to arrange the call.
The business is simple, you arrange events for internationsal companies in Europe and asia who want to work in Africa, specifically Cameroon and Gabon, you speak 4 languages and have much experience in these countries so are well placed to be able to arnage the events i=on their behalf

You expect in the next year you will take about 400k euros in income, but you will have invoices and contracts for all.
You think of that you will spend around 100k on travel costs etc.

When I did the online application I had to select security questions

  1.  Town where parents met – Arles
  2.  First car – Fiat
  3.  Favourite Girlfriend  Virginie

They usually open the account quickly after that
