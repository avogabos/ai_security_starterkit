Hello,
I am a freelance graphic designer
and a website developer and I can get a very creative logo / brand identity
/ Business Card or Letterhead designed for your website / company at a very
low price of $75 per logo. I will provide you with 4 different designs to
choose from and then unlimited reasonable revisions for them until you are
satisfied with any one of the design for your branding.
The final logo file will be high resolution vector format which you
can be used for print / web as per your requirement. I will provide with a
logo guide which you can use as a reference to provide more information
about the logo you need. You can also place a logo design request through
our online order form below or via email as well.Â  Some sample designs
are given below for your reference....
In addition I also do website designing starting at $299 per
website and write articles / content for your website at $10 per page of
500 words. Our SEO plans starts at $149 per month.
If you

want I can also arrange for references as well who can vouch that this is a
genuine offer and not a spam. Should you want to see some more of my logo
