Dear Sarah,

 

According to our client, the bank requires the notarized copy of passport, utility bill, and bank statement but he has submitted the original documents to bank already. What is happening to the bank? Can you confirm about this and solve the problem? We are still not able to use the account it has been 5 months since we ordered it.

Our client is exhausted because there have been so many problems on this.

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,




Asami Yamada
