Hi, 

 

It should state in the letter from Companies House, unfortunately it is not clear for me to see in the attachment you sent me. 

 

If you could make a clearer copy and email it to me that would be great.

Hi Poul,

 

You will need to file your financial accounts for that period before the overdue date otherwise you will incur fines monthly until you file. 

 

We can provide you this service: 

 

Dormant express accounts (if you had no transactions in that period) – £150.00 

 

If you have been trading then you will need to send the transactions for that period and we will prepare and send to you for approval 

 

Value accounting Express - £500.00 we will need at least 14 days to prepare so please do send the asap. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
