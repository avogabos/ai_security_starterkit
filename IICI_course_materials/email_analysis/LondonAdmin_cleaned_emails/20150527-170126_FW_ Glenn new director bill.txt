Dear Customer,

 

Thank you for your email and information provided.

 

Please note that the attached proof of residence for the new owner has been
forwarded to the registry. However, we would also require recent (not older
than 3months) proof of address for the previous director Mr. Billy-Jay.

Please email us the copy of the proof of residence for Mr. Billy-Jay so that
we may forward the same to the registry as soon as possible.

 

We look forward to hear from you.

 

Best Regards,

 

Rachel

Formations House

Many thanks
