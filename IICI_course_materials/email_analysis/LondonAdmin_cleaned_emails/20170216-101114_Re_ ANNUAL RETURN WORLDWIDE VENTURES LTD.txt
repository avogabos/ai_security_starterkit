Dear Aela,
We now need to file the Annual Return without delay, would it be at
all possible for you to send the forms for us to the Company Registry if I post
them over to you? I would send it directly to them however in the past they
have seemingly not received.
Your help would greatly be appreciated.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya
