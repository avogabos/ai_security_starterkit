Dear Support Team,

 

the mail arrived today (Saturday) and the post for Sleex USA Limited was not
part of it.

Something seems to have gone wrong.

 

The wallet for this company has not been used. Still £25.00.

It suggests that no post has been forwarded to me.

 

Can you investigate this please?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Kind regards

Corinna
