Victoria,

 

No they are both different services and will be charged separately. The director and shareholder can be the same or different but they are two different services. Please do let me know if you would like further clarification.

Dear Felix,

Thank you very much for the comprehensive information provided.

I have one more issue to clarify with you: in the UK Ltd company, which I am planning to register shortly with Formations House, the director and the shareholder will be one and the same person, who would like to keep his personal data (like residential address) confidential. As far as I understand, Formations House provides such service, which is Director Privacy Service and Shareholder Protection Service.

Since in our case the director and the shareholder of the projected company is one and the same person, can we expect that for the fee of 150 Pounds the service address of the director/shareholder (one person) will be substituted with the address of Formations House (London, Harley Street) in every entry, where this service address shall be specified in the Corporate Documents of the company?

We will be very thankful if such option is possible.

Best regards,
Victoria Chirillov
