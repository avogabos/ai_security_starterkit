Hi Oliver,

 

For this Mauritius bank we liaised, this is one of the more responsive bank
and documentation required is not excessive. Banks in European countries or
St Vincent usually would require bank reference letter(s) or even apostille
documents. Also, there is no monthly administrative fee for the bank account
unlike banks in other countries. 

 

For this bank, a minimum account balance requirement is USD5,000 and
accounts opened will need to be funded within 1 month. Unless client has
reasons for not wanting a Mauritius bank, then we will advise accordingly.

 

At this stage, bank account opening is not confirmed. For now, we will need
the following for bank's initial assessment. 

 

*	Business Plan to be completed - refer to attached
*	Good standing certificate/ Incumbency certificate 
*	Memorandum & Articles of Association 
*	Organogram of the company (if any)
*	CV/ Linked in account for understanding of background of Ultimate
Beneficiary Owner

 

After bank assessed and advise we can proceed further, I will provide you
with the bank account opening forms.  Thank you.

Dear Oliver,

 

 

*	Can we get any discount on this 400$ , as we will be processing all
our offshore bank account opening with your company (we have good numbers of
customers)

Reply : I can offer at USD250.  I suggest we can explore opening for 1
client for a start. 

Do note that eventually whether the account can be opened is subject to
bank's discretion. There are cases where we do not see a good fit with any
banks in our list and we do not take in the client(s) as the banks will not
take them in. There are also a particular bank who requires Skype meeting.
All Hong Kong banks require face to face meeting at their branch.

 

*	Can you also open offshore bank account for companies registered in
Africa

Reply : For this, I would need to check with bank(s). So far, we have not
have a Africa corporate client. 

We will need to understand the following before recommending.

 

*	which countries will be involved in incoming/outgoing remittances,
*	business nature
*	country where company is incorporated
*	countries businesses will be conducted
*	nationality of UBOs (Ultimate Beneficiary Owners)

Dear Oliver,

 

The banks we deal with can be found at : 

https://www.offshorecorpserve.com/index.php/en/our-services/bank-account

 

After initial evaluation of every client's background and requirements, we
can then ascertain which bank(s) are suitable and we can try apply with
those banks. 

 

All banks have their own list of high risk/ sanctioned countries. These are
countries where if the client's business or remittances are involved, the
bank will not even consider their bank application. 

Hence, we will need to understand the following before recommending.

 

*	which countries will be involved in incoming/outgoing remittances,
*	business nature
*	country where company is incorporated
*	countries businesses will be conducted
*	nationality of UBOs (Ultimate Beneficiary Owners)
*	and any other questions posed by the bank. 

 

 

As for required personal/ business documents, generally these are required.

*	Certificate of Incorporation
*	Certificate of Incumbency  
*	Memorandum & Articles of Association 
*	Register of Directors
*	Register of Members
*	Organogram of the company (if any)
*	Passport copy
*	Proof of residential address less than 3 months (Do not accept
TV/Mobile phone bill. Driving license/ Utility bill/ Bank statement/ Bank
reference letter. Full physical address must be seen.)
*	CV
*	Business Plan
*	Bank reference letter 

 

Do note that all banks may ask for additional information/ documents. Some
banks do not require bank reference letter or may request for 2 bank
reference letters.

Granting of bank account opening is also subject to banks' discretion. 

 

As for time, it should take 2 weeks or lesser. Sometimes, it can take longer
than that as it depending on how soon we get the complete notarised
documents, application forms signed, and turnaround time by the bank and
client.  

 

Let me know if you need further clarifications. Thank you.
