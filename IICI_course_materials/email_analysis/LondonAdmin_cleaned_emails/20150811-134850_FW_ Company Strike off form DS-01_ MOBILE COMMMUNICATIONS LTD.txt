Dear Oliver,

 

Last Thursday ( 5.8.2015)  i sent you the closing down Form DS01 dully signed by me in order to close/ strike off the company Mobile Commmunications Limited ( As enclosed ) On the same day i sent you the Bank Transfer of €110,00 to pay for that service.

 

Today i received the below email, asking me to sign again, the Closing Down Form DS01.

 

I already sent the enclosed form almost one week ago, and now what i need is s document stating that the company is closed because tomowrrow i have a court case and i need to present it to my lawyer.

 

Please i need your help on this subject.

 

Thanks in advance
