Dear Sarah,

 

We sent the forms by EMS International Air Mail today. The tracking number is EF 753 491 570 JP. 

We would like you to please ask the bank whether our client can receive all the information for the entry of online banking this year or not.

 

Please inform us once you receive the courier.

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,
