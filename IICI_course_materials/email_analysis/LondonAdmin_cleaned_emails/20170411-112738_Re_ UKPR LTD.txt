Hi Fabian,

 

OK, did you manage to go to the translators/notary in Piccadilly? 

 

Did you still want to present the forms and documents at the bank this afternoon? OR should we schedule another date so that we can present everything all in one go once you have all the documentation ready? I think perhaps the latter may be a wiser option. 

 

Anyways see you this afternoon. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya

Dear Fabian, 

 

It was a pleasure to meet you earlier this afternoon. Please see attached documents. The original Certificate of Incorporation I can give to you tomorrow. 

 

I am currently talking to some certified translators so hopefully something can be done tomorrow in the morning. 

 

The bank statement and the bank reference letter you have the originals with you I presume? As you will need to present them when you go there.

 

I would also advise that you get your ID card notarised with them also. 

 

I will send a separate email over to you shortly with the details.

 

Kind regards

Nadya
