Hi,

 

Since our local fax is not working, attached is the penalty waiver which you need to send it to HMRC via fax.

 

Regards,

Umair

Hi,

 

The penalty is for non submission of CT600 for the year ended 31st Decâ€™14. The original accounts were filed dormant and we do not file CT600 for dormant companies. However, amending accounts were filed later with active but loss figures.

 

Regards,

Umair
