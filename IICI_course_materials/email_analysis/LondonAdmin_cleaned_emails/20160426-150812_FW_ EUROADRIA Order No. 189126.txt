Hello Nadya,

 

Company Name: EUROADRIA

 

Order No. 189126 (Company Formation)

The above client has purchased Natural Person Nominee Director Service and
as per Charlotte's confirmation you have been appointed as the director.

 

Also the client has purchased Power of Attorney and does not want bank
account.

 

However Charlotte has informed that we would need to add a line to the POA
to effect that the attorney is responsible for all payments and management
in relation to tax and duties of the assets and the company.

 

Please find below confirmation from Charlotte for your reference. Kindly
prepare Power of Attorney and send the scan copy to Felix.

 

Also please advise if we request client to provide his address in order for

Looking forward to hear from you.

Ok the POA is acceptable

I need to know where these properties are and that they are put in the name
of the company, and we will need to ensure that taxes and duties paid up by
the client and not ever passed on to the nominee

Please ask him to add a line to the POA (or we can) to effect that the
attorney is responsible for all payments and management in relation to tax
and duties of the assets and the company

if the second one is on his name he would be hit with heavy taxes".

 

Awaiting your reply in this regard.

 

Thank you.
