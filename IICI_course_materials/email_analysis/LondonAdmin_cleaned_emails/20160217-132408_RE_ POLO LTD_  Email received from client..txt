Hello Nadya,

 

Please check the below reply received from the client.

 

 

Hello,

 

Thank you for your response. Actually I had several times requested you to
open a USD account since all our deals are based on USD with the customers,
and you had said it is under process, but seems like it has/could not be
opened due to some reasons. Anyway nothing to do after this moment.

 

About the forms, provide me with the scan copies first please to check with
the person that I'm in contact from RBS (Ms. Mirza, Business Banking
Support) if the forms are OK or if they need anything else. Then you can
send them to the following address. And I'll be in London by early or around
mid March already so I can handle the rest.

 

Didim, Altinkum Mh. Yali Cd. 74 Sk. Mandalya Apt No:5 K:2/4

09270, Aydin / Turkey

Ph: +90 505 9161616

 

Thank you,

 

Semir Kimyonok

Hi Shawn,

 

There is no dollar account opened for this company. 

 

We are sending the forms out to him today. Please confirm to which address
we can send them to for him to sign? He can then take them into the branch
with his ID so that he can be added as a signatory. 

 

Many thanks

Hello Nadya,

 

Please check below email received from the client and kindly advice. Thank
you

 

 

Hello,

 

 

Based on the below correspondence, RBS has just informed me that they have
not received any instructions from Ms. Pawar with regards to changing
signatory authority, and they are currently waiting for this to proceed.

 

 

Please check and inform me with the situation, and if there is anything
needed from my side, advise please.

 

 

Also, there is an expected incoming payment around USD 25,000, due Feb 2016.
I need USD account details please to take this transfer, as I have not been
provided earlier.

 

 

Thank you,

Semir Kimyonok
