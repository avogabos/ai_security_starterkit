Hello Nadya, please below the reply from the client and kindly advice. Thank
you

 

"Dear Customer Support,

 

Thank you for the feedback and it is understandable that you have needed to
appoint Ms. Pawar back to complete some transactions with the bank, but you
could have simply informed me on this.

 

Because, I already mentioned about the confusion we have had with the bank.
Besides, since I'll have a business trip to Italy, I have sent some related
company documents to the Italian consulate mentioning that I'm the
shareholder and the director of the company, but now I have to update all
these documents, and I'll feel myself lucky if they don't accuse me of
submitting fake documents. And also I have signed some agreements on behalf
of the company, but now they all might become void because on the date of
signature I was not the director according to the records.

 

Therefore, next time if you'll need to make any change again due to any
reason, inform me in advance please, so I can act accordingly.

 

Regarding RBS, they have sent an update request letter to the new registered
office addresstoo, I contacted them, explained the situation, told them that
due tothe transfer process we could not provide them with the necessary
update, so, we were in contact, but again suddenly they said "as far as we
checked you are not an authorised person, we cannot provide you any further
information".

 

As of now, cheque is still not cashed.

 

And I see you already have reversed the changes on the Companies House
records, if you informed me with the situation earlier I could tell you to
hold Ms. Pawar as director to complete the needed transactions.

 

Anyway, then let me talk to RBS again, and we can do the necessary
accordingly.

 

I'll keep you informed.

 

Kind Regards,

Semir Kimyonok"

Dear Semir Kimyonok,

 

We sincerely apologised for the confusion. 

 

The reason being that you could not be appointed onto the RBS account and
the cheque has still not been cashed we cannot close the account. The bank
is constantly chasing us for an update on the situation on the company.

 

Please could you kindly update us with the situation of the cheque?

 

Meanwhile we will make changes on the Companies House record today and back
date it to the original transfer.

Another email received from POLO LTD. Please check and advice.

 

Dear Customer Support,

 

On 23rd June 2015 all the share and directorship have been transferred into
my name, and the registered office address has been changed. Also, I
requested you to write me a cheque and close the account at RBS.

 

Based on these changes I was going to open a new bank account, but
surprisingly the new bank informed me that I am not the shareholder, not the
director, and has no authority to open any bank account.

 

And when I've checked with the Companies House I realised that you have
reversed all the changes. Also the cheque that I have put in cashing process
has not been paid yet and the bank account at RBS is still open.

 

Now I request you to reverse all the changes that you have made IMMEDIATELY;
transfer the share and directorship back into my name, and change the
registered office address.

 

And STOP making any change ever again as you have no more authorisation on
this company anymore. What you have done is a corporatefraud, without asking
my permission you cannot make any change, and I havealready declared to you
that I have terminated all the service agreements with your company.

 

Awaiting your earliest response and action please.

 

Kind Regards,

Semir Kimyonok
