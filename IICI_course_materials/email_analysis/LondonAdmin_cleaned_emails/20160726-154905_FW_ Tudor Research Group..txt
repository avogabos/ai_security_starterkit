Dear Rachel

 

Could you please place the following orders on the system and mark them
paid.

 

Please note Ive have overcharged for V/o service so this must show us £550
not £450. 

 

You do not need to place the order for annual return I will file this
myself.

 

Please add the following notes into admin report.  Client pay via Barclays
Cheque, £1200 cleared on 17.06.2014 ( Th 17/06)

 

Please drop me an email when all the services have been renewed.

 

Thanks, Tahir
