To whom it may concern,

 

Thank you for the update, although I am somewhat perplexed as to the banks reasoning for this, as it does not make any sense.

 

In order to move forward, I do need the services of a bank, and if you can facilitate this, I would be grateful.

 

All i require from the bank is a facility to deposit funds and do online transactions for payments etc. My personal clients want the use of offshore banking to make larger payments etc, that they don't want to go through the UK, hence the reason i need an offshore bank.

 

Please advise as to how we can move forward with another bank?

 

Regards

 

Ross

Dear Ross, 

 

As you can see from the email below the bank has declined the application due to the business activities.

 

We can submit another application to another bank that may work for you, but there may be application fees and we cannot guarantee they will open either. 

 

Please could you kindly advise what it is you require from the bank account?

 

Kind regards
