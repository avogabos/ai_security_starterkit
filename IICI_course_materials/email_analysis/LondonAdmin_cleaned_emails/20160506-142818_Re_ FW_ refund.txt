Hi Nadya,
I have already processed his refund through our merchant account. I explained to him that as the payment was made on his Barclaycard, the VISA rules stipulate that the refund has to be made back onto the original card and can't be made direct from current account to current account. I also explained there are three parties involved: our merchant service provider, VISA and his bank, so the refund may not appear immediately.
I just checked and can confirm that the funds came out of our merchant account yesterday.
Best regards,
Jason
