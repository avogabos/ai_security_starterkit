Dear Jerry



It is advisable not to issue so many shares to the director



How many shares to be assigned and to whom? 100,000 shares to LIEN , TE -
HUAI



As you have issues in the past for this, my advise to issue 100 shares to
the director and keep the rest of the shares

Unallocated, you can allocate them later if required.

We need to wait until the company will be fully dissolved at companies house

Or you register with slight change of company name

I advise you to use some other name or make little changes in the name

As this name is already undergone liquidation, so maybe you get problems in
the future

If you insist on having same name, then your client needs to wait
