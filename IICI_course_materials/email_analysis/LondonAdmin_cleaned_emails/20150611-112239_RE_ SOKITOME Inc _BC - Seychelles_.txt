First

Lets get the exact country list, Africa is generalistic, and if the bank
know which places and what type of product they may consider

 

Rietumu may have the same issue.

 

Then customer however should have kept to a standard info on the form and
the call,.

 

We have other clients in africa with these accounts, so I can only think he
didnt clarify the position, or he said something they didnt like

 

Rietumu are also not fans of arcade games or slot machine games.. so again
without a very clear understanding of the business we wont know what
direction to take

Nadya/Charlotte,

 

Customer signed up for the Seychelles Starter Pack for £795 and paid for
it.We set up the company sent him the company documents and the Euro Pacific
Bank forms, He filled it and send it to us and the bank spoke to him and he
informed them that his business would be mainly getting payments from
African countries however in the form he had mentioned US,UK  is where
payments would be made and his payments would be coming from the Arab
Nations.

 

The bank informed him that they do not accept payments from African
countries which is no use to him than and he would like his money back for
the bank account.

 

Kindly let me know how to proceed as I need to update him by calling him
before lunch time.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.
