Hi Nadya –

That’s OK!  We’ve standardized our Account Opening Procedure and it’s very efficient.  If you find any confusion or troubles with it, please let me know.  I really appreciate feedback ☺

Also, are you receiving our friendly emails the past few weeks with other tips and tricks to open account most quickly?

Best,
Ashe

Hi Ashe,

Thank you for your email. I did complete the online application but put all the details of the client so have no Ticket ID I guess it was sent to him directly?

I will email the pre-approval document to the account management team. I apologise for the misunderstanding, as before I emailed everything directly to Vincent.

Kind regards

Nadya
