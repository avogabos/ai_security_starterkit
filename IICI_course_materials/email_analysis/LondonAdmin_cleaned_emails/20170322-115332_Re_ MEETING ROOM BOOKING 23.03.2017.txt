RE: MEETING ROOM BOOKING 23.03.2017
Hi Jeff,
Yes sure no problem. I will get Danielle to put  the heating on early in the morning.
I will prepare the invoice, I may be in a little later tomorrow about 12ish. So someone else may take the payment.
Kind regards
Nadya Crawford

Hi Nadya,
Just a quick reminder for the room heating before we come tomorrow morning.
If ok for you, I'll pay for the room by credit card when I get to your office tomorrow morning.
