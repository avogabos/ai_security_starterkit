Hi Charlotte,

Thank you for your payment advice, however for some reason you have settled the majority of the invoices (including those that are not yet due), apart from the two older items which triggered the disconnec tion notice in the first place.

Is there any particular reason for this?

Obviously we are happy to get a payment in advance, however there will still be an overdue on the account, unless we re-allocate or an additional payment of Â£1,426.37 is issued to cover the July and August invoices.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Kind Regards
