Hi Charlotte
 
Halifax have now finally reviewed your payslips and have noticed that they do not show a full date on them – they just show ‘28th’, do you have payslips which show the full date? If not could you please provide as name, fax number and email address from someone at your company that can verify your income?  Halifax will send them a reference to complete.
 
Kind regards

Leo

Hi Charlotte,
 
This is particularly bad service from Halifax but as Leo says we doing our best although its difficult to get them to move remortgages along quickly as they are dealing with so many applications and don’t have the capacity to address the work load any quicker.
 
We’ll continue to keep you posted and look forward to helping you complete.

Hi Charlotte
 
We have been chasing Halifax for a further update but unfortunately they are still  massively behind due to high business volumes!  Therefore they saying it still take up to a further 2 weeks until your documents are assessed!!
 
We are doing what we can to try and speed up the process but are not getting very far I’m afraid.  We will continue to keep the pressure on them and as soon as an update is available we will be in contact again. 

Many thanks for your patients.

Kind regards

Leo

Hi Charlotte
 
Hope you had a nice weekend.

We just received notification from Halifax that your survey is back and has been valued at £485k – this is lower than the £500k we submitted however does not affect the ‘Loan To Value’ which means you can still have the maximum loan amount we applied for you.
 
In terms of your documents being assessed Halifax still have a big back log due to high business volumes – currently they are working on applications received on the 19th June!! And yours was submitted on the 2nd of July so they are saying we could be looking at a further 2 weeks yet.  We will keep continue to keep the pressure on them but in busy periods like this they tend to focus more on purchases over re-mortgages unfortunately.
 
Will keep you posted.

Kind regards

Leo

No its ok no one will need to be at home they will literally ‘drive-by’ the property.
 
Not yet Halifax instruct the survey on submission of the application – they need to assess your documents first so will have a further update for you next week.

Dear Leo,
 
Filled below for you
 
The survey date is fine, and I can arrange my Housekeeper to be home if needed.
 
Does this mean its provisionally approved subject to survey (as in im approved for the loan in theory?)
 
Thanks
