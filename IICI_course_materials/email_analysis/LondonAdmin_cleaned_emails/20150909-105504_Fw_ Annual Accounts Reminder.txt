To avoid any penalty please submit the Annual Accounts and Corporation Tax Return, to the Companies House and HM Revenue and Customs (Inland Revenue) respectively, as soon as possible.     You are advised to finalize all ledgers and accounts, up to the year end (i.e. the Accounting Reference Date - ARD).   For further assistance or information, you may reach us at the contacts below.
