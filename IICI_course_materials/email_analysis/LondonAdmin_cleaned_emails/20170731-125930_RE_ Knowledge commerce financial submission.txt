Hi Manvinder, 

 

I called you back and left a message on your mobile 07553214700 on Friday morning. 

 

We are currently in a transitional period of moving offices.

 

Please kindly see my previous email on how to pay the outstanding amount or let us know if we can use another card. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
