Re: MAIL SERVICES for TOTAL BRAND SECURITY
Hello Nadya,
good to know I have a direct communication with you again :-)
I have seen your missed call on my UK mobile number. Problem is I am on New Zealand time. Better is in fact to call me on (020) 7193 9152 as I am more likely to see this one.
Anyway the remaining £625 will be paid today Wednesday or latest tomorrow Thursday. This will be by bank transfer to make it easy.
PLEASE coordinate with Tarik regarding the small label but needs to be sent to Kings Lynn/ultra urgent.
Here again;
the label looks like;
<image001.png>
and it needs to be sent express to;
Sarita Bagnall
CCL Decorative Sleeves
Rollesby Road,
Hardwick Industrial Estate,
Kings Lynn,
PE30 4LS
United Kingdom
+44 1553 818107
many thanks for confirming when you have sent it.
Best regards,
Adrian

Hi Adrian,
Thank you.
I just tried calling you on your mobile from Charlottes mobile our lines in the office are temporarily down. When is the best time to call?
Just so you know the accountants have started preparing your accounts.
My direct line is 0207 612 488. The lines should be working in the next few hours.
I finish today at 4pm and I am in tomorrow from 10.30am.

hello Nadya,
I will pay the £825 but have to transfer some money from New Zealand.
I have paid so far £200 leaving £625 to pay. The payment references; CUST ID 855778
Great would be if you give me your phone direct number and I can dictate my credit card details and pay immediately if you want. But please don't delay the extreme accounting.
There is still something else that needs to be sent to Kings lynn. Tarik has it.  it is a simple looking label but is of high importance to be sent.
Many thanks for confirming you have sent this also.
