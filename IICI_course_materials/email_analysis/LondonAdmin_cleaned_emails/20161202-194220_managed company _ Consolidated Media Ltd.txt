Hi Charlotte, hope you are doing well.

 

Consolidated Media Ltd

 

This customer had the above Managed Company Package which expired in 2014
and we took the company back as my customer didn't renew it. This company
was transferred to Rizwan's client but due to some issues in Consolidated
Media Ltd; you gave some other company to Rizwans client.

 

My customer is back, hes saying that he wants to take back this company.
Please advise if we can still offer this company to him?

 

Thanks
