Please check email below.

 

So I’m thinking I could just post these Incumbencies out to you guys and then you can send out it all out to customer with COGS by courier?

 

I’m guess you will probably receive the COGS by tomorrow? Let me know what you think is best ASAP as I’ll have to go to post office again today. 

 

Thanks
