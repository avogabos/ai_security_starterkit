Hi Nadya

 

Thanks for this.

 

As explained I have a few Companies as well which may also get mail so if I
give you the names I assume that will all be included.

 

Please confirm

 

Thanks

Hi Anthony, 

 

Yes that is fine. We will need a copy of your ID, scanned and emails would
be easiest. So passport and proof of address as this is our business policy
and we are regulated by HMRC which is a requirement everything is protected
under the data protection act. 

 

We usually charge 275GBP per company/per person but as you are using a
consistent name we can offer you a special price of 400GBP.

 

Please kindly confirm all the names that will be coming to the address to I
may notify the mail department. 

 

Please confirm if you would like to go ahead I can then place an order on
our system and send you our bank details. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya

Hi Nadya

 

You may recall I came in the other day to request the services of an
address. I have an address  at the moment across the road to you but they
have sold the building for Medical use exclusively.

 

Post can sometimes arrive for my family Trusts but will always have the name
"TRUP" in the addressee.

 

Please let me know how I can set this up with you.

 

Thanks

 

Kind Regards

 

Anthony
