Hi Denise and Nadya

 

Hope you are doing well.

 

I have a client for Virtual Office Mail Service, who would like his mails to
be scanned and forwarded to him by email.

 

Client would like to know the cost and turnaround time by asking for example
if we receive 50 mails (envelops) with 'X' number of pages on Monday
morning, what will be cost for scanning (per page) and emailing (per
envelop) and in how many hours or days he will receive all the pages from
these 50 envelops?

 

This is just an example that client has given, as it is a startup, therefore
initially there will be lesser mails.

 

Please advice as soon as possible, client is in hurry and need service as
soon as possible. Will be ordering service for 12 months, will also use
Phone and Fax service and also has shown interest in meeting rooms.

 

Thank you.
