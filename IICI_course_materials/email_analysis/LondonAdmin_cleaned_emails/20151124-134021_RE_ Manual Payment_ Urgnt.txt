Hi Nayda, could u pls try to charge the card again.... thanks

 

Hi Sarah,

I was just informed by my credit card that the payment was declined (the one
your customer service 

agent processed manually).  They blocked it due to security reasons (they
thought it was fraudulent).

I have spoken to the credit card and confirmed the transaction is authorized
by me, so they have 

advised me that you can please try to run the purchase again, and it should
go through this time.

 

So I am now requesting you to please try to process the payment again using
the same card details. 

It should not be declined this time.
