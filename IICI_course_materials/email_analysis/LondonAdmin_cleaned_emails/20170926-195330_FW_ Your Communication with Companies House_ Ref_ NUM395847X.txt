Dear Sir(s)

G&G STARS LTD - 07127015

Further to your recent correspondence concerning the above company.

Documents currently required:

Confirmation Statement for review period end 19/05/2017

As you require the company to remain on the register, we have stopped the strike off action. 

I am prepared to defer prosecution action for 14 days from the date of this email.

If the company record is not brought up-to-date by that time, the directors may face criminal proceedings.  Conviction for this offence will result  in a criminal record and a potential unlimited fine for each document not delivered on time.

You may be able to deliver your confirmation statement online via our Web Filing service, which has in-built checks to ensure that you get it right first time. Our web-site  www.companieshouse.gov.uk gives information on this along with a full range of guidance booklets and forms.

Yours faithfully

Mr B Owen

Compliance Case Officer
