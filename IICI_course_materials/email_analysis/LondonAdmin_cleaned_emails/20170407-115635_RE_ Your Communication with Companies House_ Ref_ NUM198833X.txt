Dear Madam

Thank you for your email concerning the restoration of the above company.

If you are going to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

3)  Form CS01 for the year ending  15/04/2017 & £40 filing fee. Please note, existing companies, as a minimum will need to provide:

-     Part 2 – Statement of Capital (unless they have filed a SoC since the 30th June 2016 e.g. SH01)

-    Part 5 – PSC (unless the company has already provided PSC information, because it has elected to hold its PSC register publicly)

4)  Accounts for the periods ending 28/02/2016

Having checked our records, there are outstanding late filing penalties of £750 due on the 2016  accounts.

Forms are available to download from Companies house website, and your application should be sent for the attention of the restoration section at Companies House.
