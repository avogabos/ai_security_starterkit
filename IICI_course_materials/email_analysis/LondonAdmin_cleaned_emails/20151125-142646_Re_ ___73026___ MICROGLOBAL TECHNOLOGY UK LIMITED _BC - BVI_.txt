Hi Nadya,


Thanks for the documents. I noticed:


1. Mr. Liang's notarized passport copy is out dated, it was back in March. 
Document certifications for individuals should be dated within 90 days of 
submission.


2. Ms. Cui's notarized passport copy doesn't contain the page that has her 
signature on it.


3. Mr. Liang's HSBC bank statement only dated back to July, we will also 
need the older statement that's older than 6 months from the same account.


4. Ms. Cui's bank statement is also the same situation as point 3, we will 
also need the older statement that's older than 6 months from the same 
account.


5. We also need the rest of pages copies for Memorandum.


6. I didn't receive the signed Corporate Resolution -

Do let me know if I missed anything.

Best regards,
