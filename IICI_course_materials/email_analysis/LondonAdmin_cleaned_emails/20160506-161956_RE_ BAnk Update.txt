Felix,

 

I cannot say exactly we just have to wait. Compliance have to go through all their checks first this can take time. It’s a very big bank.  I am hoping They should contact him by next week no earlier than Tuesday. 

 

When I went to the bank on Wednesday they said the concerned person/department would receive it the next day so I suggest give it 4/5 days. 

 

Thanks for your assistance. Sorry for it not going so quickly but this is how banks work in the UK especially if they are not present in the UK 

 

Could you just ask how much amount will be and where it is coming from somehow please ?  as if it’s very high they may ask to review their business which in turn may slow the process even more – don’t mention that bit to him just yet though please!

Nadya,

 

Not a problem I will get in touch with him, Just need to understand the process. After you send the documents to the bank what’s the estimated time they get back to us or the client directly and if all the documents are ok than what’s the next process, Me understanding this will help me assist the client.

 

Thanks in Advance for your help.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

I’m not going to talk to him there is nothing to update him on. You’re the account manager, I’m very fragile at the moment unfortunately so if I was to talk to him I would probably start crying.

 

Yes there is nothing from stopping him transferring the money into the account in EUROS it will just get converted into pounds with their exchange rate! 

 

I cannot apply for a euro account as I’m being taken off the account. Once he has been appointed as the signatory on the account, they will send him the correct form.
