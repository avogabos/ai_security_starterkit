Im slightly confused, as this company is dissolved so why are there renewal orders?

Also the order is 6 yrs old, we cant refund something that is from then, I don’t know why the trademark want carried out, and the other issue with refund is MLR only allows us to refund to original payment source, I cant refund to a dissolved company, its against the law

Dear Nadya,

 

I hope all is well with you.

 

Please find customer email below and attachment from customer. He had placed an order no. 128081 for TRADEMARK REGISTRATION. He says it was not delivered to him and requests for a refund. Could you please check and advise accordingly. However this company has been dissolved on  26/04/2016.

 

Awaiting your reply in this regard.

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael

Hi

Could
you please advise when we can hear from you regarding the attached case and
your below Email

 

We
regret to say this is the second time to get from us money and we haven’t
got in return your services for such money nor our money back

Years back Before there was 350  GBP paid to your company for
trade market registration for which you never get the service done nor return
back our money  despite of many reminders ..

 

Is
this case will take the same scenario ???!!

So
we don’t have to follow up ???

 

It
is really frustrating and such conduct shouldn’t be raised from a company
like you and customer like us dealing with you from almost 9 years 

 

 

Thanks & Regards ,

 

Sincerely,
