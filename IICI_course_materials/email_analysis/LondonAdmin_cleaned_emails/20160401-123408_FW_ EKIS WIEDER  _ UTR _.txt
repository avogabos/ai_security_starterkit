Hello Tariq, Shawn, Michael, Rachel

 

I have still not received an email with the Government Gateway registration.

Again the authorisation code is delivered to the Company Registered Address.

 

I cannot accept that this has not been received by your offices.

 

I will not accept a repeat of the original HMRC letter dated 14 January -
which took over  6 weeks for Formations House to send to me.

 

PLEASE check your mail & system and forward the letter urgently.

 

Please acknowledge this email.

 

kind regards

Bruce Allsobrook
