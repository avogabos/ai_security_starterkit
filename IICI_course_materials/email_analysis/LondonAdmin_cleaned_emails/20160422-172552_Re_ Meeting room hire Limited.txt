Hi Nadya,

the room was cold, there was not sufficient lighting, I asked for someone to check on 
us for drinks and nothing happened, the internet was unusably slow. It took 30 minutes and 3 phone calls to book the room!!

Nothing was fit for purpose. The only thing that has been done effectively is sending me an invoice.

The service has been good in the past.

I will settle 50% of the invoice as a gesture of good will.
