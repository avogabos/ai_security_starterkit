Hello Nadya,



I have already forwarded all the signed documents you sent me for the above
companies to AC Management, they replied back stating:

Please note that both Companies have been renewed.

Also missing is resolution for share transfer for United Ace and Resolution
for change of Director for both the companies.

Please ask your client to sign and send the attached documents by email so
that we may submit the same to registry ASAP.

Best Regards,

 

Rachel
