Hi Philip,

 

You paid for the renewal of following domains:

However you have our hosting service for both domains and I believe the

Is this reminder for hosting services or domain registration (total charge
£50)? In this connection, I have already paid £20 for two domain
registrations a few weeks ago (include in payment of £120 on 15 April).
