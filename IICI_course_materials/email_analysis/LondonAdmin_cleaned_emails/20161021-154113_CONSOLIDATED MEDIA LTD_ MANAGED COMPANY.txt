Hello Nadya!

CONSOLIDATED MEDIA LTD: MANAGED COMPANY

 

This  managed company was formed for my customer. This customer was sold to
Rizwan's clients last year as my customer didn't renew his managed company
package which expired back in 2014. 

 

My client has emailed about his balance in the bank account for this
company. could you please check how much balance this customer had and how
can we transfer it back to him? I have checked my correspondence with him
...as per my email dated  6/5/201;this customer had a balance of 441.59 GBP.
But im not sure about it.

 

Please check and confirm.

 

Regards,

 

Sarah
