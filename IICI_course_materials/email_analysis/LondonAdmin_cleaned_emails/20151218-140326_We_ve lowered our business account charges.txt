Hello,

We're doing everything we can to make your business banking simpler. Here's some of the changes we've made:

We've reduced the interest rate for unarranged overdrafts from 29.5% to 15% a year

We've reduced the paid referral fee for an unarranged overdraft from &#163;30 to &#163;20

This is the fee we charge you when you try to pay for something and there isn't enough money in your account, but we still make the payment.

We've reduced the unpaid item fee for an unarranged overdraft from &#163;35 to &#163;20

This is the fee we charge you when you try to pay for something and there isn't enough money in your account, so we don't make the payment.

What's more our Small Business Loan is now completely fee free

We don&#8217;t charge an arrangement fee or an early repayment charge for our Small Business Loans. That&#8217;s for both new and existing customers.

For loans of &#163;1000 up to &#163;25000. Please note we may need security in the form of a Director&#8217;s guarantee.

Kind regards,

The Business Banking Team

Security may be required for which a fee may apply. Over 18s only.

ANY PROPERTY USED AS SECURITY, WHICH MAY INCLUDE YOUR HOME,
MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE OR OTHER DEBT SECURED ON IT.
