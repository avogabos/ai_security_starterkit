Dear Ms. Nadya .
Thanks for your prompt reply , please place the renewal order and I will immediately execute the transaction . if there is going to be an issue I will inform you . would you please just send me short note when I can log in and make payment of £15.00 and complete filling .
Regarding annual financial filing we will prepare accordingly and I will make sure to send to Mr. Fahad or your accounts department well in advance before june 30 , 2017 for timely filing .
An other issue we have to deal with ,  even though I requested Mr. Tariq he ignored and time just passed . Now would you please find out for me . your office handled Trade Mark registration past year for me '  New Life Aesthetics '  a UK trade mark .
However , under my business name I would like to change the ownership to my personal name DR . NAVEED AHMAD QURESHI  for certain reasons. actually  Tariq made that mistake when we submitted application and then he suggested me once the application is approved and certificate of registration issued we can request for change of ownership / Title . would you please ask your office manager how should we proceed now and what is the cost for fixing it .
Thanking you and Best Regards .
Dr. Naveed Ahmad Qureshi .

Dear Dr. Naveed,
You do indeed have your Virtual Office Service up until October 2017.
However, the Registered address and Online Company Administrator does need renewing as these are separate services. Registered Address is the legal address of the company and the Virtual Office is your business address.
Annual Return is now due and the overdue date will be 13th September 2016 at Companies House.  It has actually very recently changed and is now called a Confirmation Statement and there is a small change where it is compulsory to confirm Person with Significant control.
You can file it through the OnlineCompany Administrator and then you will be asked to make the payment of 15GBP once paid it will automatically be electronically filed. 
I can place the renewal order for you and then you can pay by bank transfer or card?
Regarding your Annual Accounts I need to confirm with the accountants what is required exactly but I can see on Companies House: 
Next accounts made up to 30 September 2016 
due by 30 June 2017 
Kind regardsNadya
