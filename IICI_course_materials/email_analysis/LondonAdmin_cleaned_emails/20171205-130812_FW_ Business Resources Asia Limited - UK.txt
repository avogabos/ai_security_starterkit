Dear Sarah,

 

Thank you for your reply.

In regards to this company’s annual accounts,  is it necessary to keep the trading status for RBS bank account? Or we can file as it is non trading and dormant company?

 

Please check the letters immediately as our client cannot log in to their RBS internet banking.

 

We look forward to hearing from you .

 

Best Regards,

Asami Yamada

Dear Sarah,

 

We would like you to please file the annual accounts for Business Resources Asia Limited. It is still a dormant and nontrading company.

It may occur a late filing penalty. Can you please how much they will be charged in this case?

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.
