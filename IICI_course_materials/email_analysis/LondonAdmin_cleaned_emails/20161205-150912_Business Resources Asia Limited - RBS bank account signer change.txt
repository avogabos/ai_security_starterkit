Subject: Business Resources Asia Limited - RBS bank account signer change
From: Asami Yamada <asami@assencial.com>
To: londonadmin@formationshouse.com

Dear Nadya,

I am Asami Yamada who introduced Business Resources Asia Limited to Mr
Mochizuki and as you know, he was appointed as a director for the company
and visited UK to be a signer of its RBS bank account with you.
He would like to know if his singer change request has been accepted or
not. We asked this to Sarah over and over again but she rarely replies to
us so we decided to contact you directly.

Can you please tell us the situation there? Have you received any reply
from bank? If no, why is this taking so long? Mr Mochizuki has complained
this slow process.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks and Best Regards,

Asami Yamada
