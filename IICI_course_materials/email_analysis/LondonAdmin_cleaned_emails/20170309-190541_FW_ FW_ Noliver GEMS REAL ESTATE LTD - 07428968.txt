Dear Mr Gomes

 

Thank you for your email regarding the change of registered office, as the company is in proof you are only able to file a paper AD01.

The conformation statement can be submitted in paper format as it is not covered by the proof system.

A reminder letter with the company authentication code can be issued to the usual residential address for each director we currently have recorded.

 

Would you kindly confirm that this action will be acceptable?

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Yours sincerely 

 

Nia Oliver
