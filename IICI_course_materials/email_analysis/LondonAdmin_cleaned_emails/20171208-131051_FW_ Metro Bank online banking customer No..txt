Subject: Fwd: Metro Bank online banking customer No.

 

 

Good morning,

Below is the online banking customer Number required to set up the account 1664472 , as you are aware you will now need the old director needs to go/call their local branch of Metro Bank to transfer the account from them to my profile using the above number.

 

There will be a mandate that Andy will need to sign but when the old director goes to the Bank they should  request for the mandate to be available at Maidstone for me to sign. At the same time as signing the mandate in the Maidstone branch I'll be able to set up online banking and receive any relevant bank cards.

It was also recommended that when at the Bank it is made clear that I will show at Companies House but  not on Exprian yet and to make the transfer on this basis rather than only using Exprian.

I hope this makes sense.

Kind regards,o set up online banking.

Kind regards,
