Dear Mr Trup,

 

Indeed our lease ended however as you are aware even when a lease ends there is a period to move, and it is this that was cut short.

As I explained in our conversation a few weeks ago, we temporarily connected a redirect of mail addressed to 29 to 37. Longer term we have our own new building but due to the short notice to vacate we couldn’t move into our new premises without a period with no office.

We have our new office from 18th, but we also have an arrangement in negotitation with Number One.

We would be happy to either refund, or move your address service to Number One, or move it once we can confirm our address on the 18th.

 

I am actually away at the moment, but return to work on Monday 14th where I can arrange whichever preference you have.

Kind Regards

Charlotte Pawar

Dear Charlotte

 

I have to tell you that I have had it confirmed that the reason you moved was because your lease ended and was nothing to do with Health and Safety. You must have known this for sometime previous to my paying you the £400 and yet you said nothing.

 

You surely must recognise that what you have done is wrong and the story about Health and Safety is fictitious.

 

I would like to settle the issue with you amicably if possible and would ask you to arrange a refund which you must know is the correct thing to do to bring this matter to a close.

 

Please let me have your proposals

 

Regards

 

Anthony

Dear Charlotte

 

I understand now  that your lease of 29 Harley Street had ended and the freeholders were asking a rent you couldn`t agree with and that`s why you moved. I was surprised that I wasn`t informed at the time if this was the case as this must have been under negotiation for some time.

 

I had mail sent to 37 Harley Street in accordance with your e mail which was not delivered to me and the solicitors there told me that it was probably returned to sender.

 

I also understood that following your e mail you were moving to your new address on the 18th August and can you explain that if you are moving to 22 Harley Place mail is proposed to go to another address other than Harley Place.

 

Regards

 

Anthony

Dear Mr Trup 

We have been based at 29 Harley Street for the last 10 years, however we had to move abruptly as the council suddenly deemed our building unsuitable under their safety regulations. We are moving our office to 22 Harley Place however registered, mailing and virtual office addresses will be moved to either 1 Harley Street or 37 Harley Street. When we have moved your address you will be duly informed as such. Under our terms and conditions we are able to move your address under circumstances like this. 

The moving of all addresses is a process that takes a few weeks, we have thousands of customers all of which have to be stringently checked through our own money laundering regulations before the change is confirmed.  

Currently we are continuing to collect any and all mail sent to 29 Harley Street & 37 Harley Street, thus your mailing address service has not been interrupted. 

We are dealing with the situation appropriately and will keep you informed of developments. We hope to have a permanent solution before the end of the month. 


Kind Regards

Charlotte Pawar

Dear Charlotte Pawar

 

You would have seen my e mail to Danielle below.

 

I see you are the Director of AC Online Ltd .

 

I am astonished that there has been no reply to my e mail and Danielle seems to ignore the terrible situation that has been created having it seems no plan to  move  to another office in the locality despite giving assurances that you were.

 

I have to say regrettably that I feel I have been misled in paying your Company a  £400 fee for a service you clearly cannot provide.

 

I  must asked you to treat this with the seriousness it deserves and arrange a refund  expeditiously.

 

Please respond urgently.

 

Yours Sincerely

 

Anthony

Dear Danielle, 

 

I was very disappointed that when I met you today to collect my post you walked off when I asked you what the arrangements are going forward.

 

You had told me previously that after moving from 29 then 37 Harley Street you will be moving either to Harley Place or York Gate.

 

This has been a disaster for me as I paid you £400 for the year for the virtual office which it seems you cannot provide.

 

I have had to re-route as much of my post as I can for a third time having routed it first to 29 Harley street then to 37 Harley street on your instructions and now having to re-route it again.

 

If you are not establishing  a new permanent  office in the area then it is only right that you should say so  and in that event you should refund me as you cannot provide the service you charged for.

 

Please respond to me and let me know urgently what the situation is.

 

Regards

 

Anthony

Dear Customer, , 

Formations House is moving!

The long-term lease on our current offices has come up for renewal and we have used this opportunity to move to a more modern better suited office building.

Currently we have 3 rooms of a single floor in a period building on Harley Street. As some of you may be aware we occasionally have power failures, internet connectivity issues and visitors have very little space to wait when collecting mail and other enquiries. Moving forward we wanted to give our visitors a fresh and modern experience whenever they come to meet us.

Our new building will be on Harley Place, a mere 150 feet from our existing building however we will have the entire building at our disposal for hospitality. The new office is very modern, has excellent connectivity and offers visitors space to sit, take refreshments and have formal or informal meetings with us at any time in the working day.

Our new office however is being refurbished to our standard and won't be ready until the 18th August. Between July 10th and August 18th, we will be unable to meet any customers at our current offices.

Customers who attend our offices regularly to collect mail will be asked if they prefer their mail forwarded at no additional cost to them (this is only for customers on hold who usually collect), or to collect their mail as usual but at a prearrange time and date at a temporary location next door on Harley Street.

All Registered Address subscribers:
We will move all registered addresses at Companies House to our new address without charge to the customer.


Postal and Service address customers:
For HMRC where we act as accountants, we will arrange the update of the address. For all other customers using 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR to receive non-government mail such as bank correspondence and customer communications you will need to change the address provided to: c/o AC Online, 37 Harley Street, London, W1G 8QG


Customers whose address related services have expired more than 3 months ago will not be transferred automatically. Any mail items (government or otherwise) will not be stored/ scanned/ forwarded or otherwise available.

Customers who regularly book meeting rooms will be unable to do so from now on, however we can recommend other providers if necessary.

From everyone at Formations House we thank you for your continued support and we look forward to seeing you at our new modern offices in the coming weeks.
