Thank you for your recent e-mail concerning the restoration of the above

for the non filing of statutory documents. 

Please note that if the above company is being restored to continue to trade
the company can apply for an application for administrative restoration.

outstanding documents -   Annual returns for the years   26/02/2015 with
filing fees of    £40 

Together with late filing penalties of £375 for the late filing of the 2014
accounts. 

Please note that the accounts for the period ending 28/02/2015 are due for
filing by the 30/11/2015 and will be required to be filed as part of the
restoration application if the company is not restored by this date. 

The registrar also requires a Bona Vacantia waiver letter which can be
