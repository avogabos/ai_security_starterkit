HI,
 
We have a card processing pdq (TID ****1527) and we seem to have an issue with one transaction in particular.
 
On the 1st October 2015 we did a cardholder not present charge of £140,00.
We have the authorisation from the cardholder, and the issue is not the charge itself.
 
The transaction had a Not Authorised code, so the cardholder paid us by bank transfer instead.
Since then the cardholder is insisting the funds have been charged from her card, but we don’t see card breakdowns so we cant tell if this is the case.
 
Please can you look at a transaction through the terminal at 13:52 01/10/15 and see if it was processed or not. 
Please let me know if you need any other details
 
Kind Regards,
 
Charlotte Pawar
