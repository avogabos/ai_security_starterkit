Dear Charlotte

 

I asked my in-house layer to check the cost for restoring BVI company.

 

I have the following information:

 

Section 215, subsection 2 of BVI Business Companies Act 2004 as amended (the
Act) where a company has been struck off the Register, the company, or a
director, member, liquidator or receiver thereof, may (a) make application
for restoration of the company to the Register; Under section 217 where a
company has been struck off the Register, but not dissolved, the Registrar
may, upon receipt of an application in the approved form and upon payment of
the restoration fee and all outstanding fees and penalties, restore the
company to the Register and issue a certificate of restoration to the
Register. Under section 236 of the Act, the fees are as follows: 

 

For the restoration of the name of a company to the Register by the
Registrar (a) if the application for restoration is made 6 months or less
after the date that the name of the company was struck from the Register
$350.00 (b) if the application for restoration is made more than 6 months
after the date that the name of the company was struck from the Register
$750.00 USD

 

 

We have to pay the fee of $ 350 each year plus 50% penalty plus agent fees
of $150 per year. Total of $625 per year

for 7 years starting from 2008.

625 x 7=  $4375/-  plus $750  = $ 5125/- dollars is the total cost to
restore the company Charles Securities Ltd plus your fees ?

 

I don't know how you calculated before the charges. If you are not able to
restore the company, I will ask you to authorise your agent to release the 

file to our new agent when I have agreed with the new agent the terms to
restore the company.

 

Kind Regards

Ravi
