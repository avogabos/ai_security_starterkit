Nadya,

 

Yes he will send the originals to you via courier but as you had requested him to send the scanned ones first. If its ok I can have him courier it to us.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida

 

P.S He had sent two attachments 1 was the Identify card and the other was a utility bill both notarized.

I have highlighted in Table B if he sends scanned version for me to check first and then he can send the originals to me and then I can then send it on to the bank.

The Identity card he would have to provide himself in the branch so that is why I have suggested the 2 forms of address.

Nadya,

 

Attached are the documents you had requested scanned for interweb bank account transfer. Please check and let me know if all is good so I can have Marc courier the documents to us.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.
