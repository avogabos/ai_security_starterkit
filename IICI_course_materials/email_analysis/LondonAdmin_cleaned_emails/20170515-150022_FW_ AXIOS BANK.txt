Hello Oliver, 

 

This is to confirm that it is in fact my clients, headed by Thang, who own the Axios Credit Bank Limited in Singapore (they set up the website you see when you google Axios Credit Bank) and they own 100% of Axios Credit Ltd. which operates from Singapore, Hong Kong and various other countries. It's an existing finance company that wants a "bank" labeling to enhance their status. I'll get you the letter from them as we discussed. I'll also get in topuch with Euro Exim to see what's holding up the payment, but I suspect it's that their GBP account is with a NZ bank and that of course takes longer than a UK to UK bank transfer.

 

We'll keep in touch later today,

 

All best,

 

Michael
