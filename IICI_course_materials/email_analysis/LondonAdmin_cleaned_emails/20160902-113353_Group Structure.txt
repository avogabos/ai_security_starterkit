FAO - Nadia,

Thank you for your assistance on the phone.

We require the help of your services for our looking to move to a group company structure.  I hope the attached excel sheets help to illustrate the proposed structure.

Could you kindly let us know how much it would cost for your assistance, a holding company is to be formed, together with a second subsidiary company, all relevant resolutions and articles regarding changes to shares and structure.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Clare.
