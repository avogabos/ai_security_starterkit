Hi Jaap,
Sorry for the delay I have been away from the office.
If you see the letter from the Bank, UniCredit, confirming his address and Identity details which are attached on pages 3 and 4.
I have also attached a copy of a recent bank statement.
Please let me know if this is sufficient.
Kind regards
Nadya
