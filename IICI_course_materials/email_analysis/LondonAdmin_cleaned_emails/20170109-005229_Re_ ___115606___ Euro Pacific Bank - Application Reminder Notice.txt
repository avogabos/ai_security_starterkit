Hi Nadya


The client has provided most of the documents however there is still a couple of items missing, specifically the reference to the shareholder WORLDWIDE VENTURES, the client has said they have contacted Formationshouse regarding the registers and KYC for WORLDWIDE VENTURES.  Are you aware of this?
