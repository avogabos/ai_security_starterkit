Charlotte, Tahir

 

We haven't received our mail today and I presume it is because our wallet
has only 16p in it. I have tried to top it up but as usual your system
accepts neither the name on the card or the house number (see screen shot
below). Please could one of you call me on my mobile 07785363738 to take my
credit card details so that we get our mail.

 

Best wishes

 

Darrell

Hi Tahir

 

Could you confirm you received the cancellation below? I am in Malaysia at
the moment and want to check it hasn't gone into your SPAM folder, otherwise
I'll give you a call.
