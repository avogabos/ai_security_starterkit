Summary: Room reservation

 

Hi,

 

Our company might have to organise a data room in the near future. We would

need a room with sufficient space for up to one month. 

 

Is it possible in your facility 29 Harley Street and how much does it cost ?

Could you send me photographs of the room and access to it ? 

 

If you don't have such can you recommend a place in London that does that ? 

 

Best regards 

 

Hervé Schwartz
