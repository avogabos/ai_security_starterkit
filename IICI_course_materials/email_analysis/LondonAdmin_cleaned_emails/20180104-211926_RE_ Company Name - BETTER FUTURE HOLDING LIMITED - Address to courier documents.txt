Hi Nadya,

Client has paid 75 GBP for International Recorded Delivery. Please view
order number 194242 for your reference.

Should I inform client about Please be aware this destination has a war
torn area surcharge of £95 and also for additional payment (20 GBP)?


Looking forward to hear from you.

Thanks

Hey thanks, but courier has just come back to me saying :

 


Please be aware this destination has a war torn area surcharge of £95. 

Please confirm you are happy to go ahead

 

How much did customer initially pay for this?
