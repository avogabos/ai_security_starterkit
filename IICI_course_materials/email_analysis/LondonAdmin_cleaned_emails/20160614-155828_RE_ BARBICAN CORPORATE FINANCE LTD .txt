I dropped by the office last Thursday to collect my post. However Charlotte
informed me that my post had been sent out to me the day before.

 

I have not received anything yet. Could you please confirm that this post
was correctly sent to my new address (as advised to you below - i.e. Gate
Farm Lodge, Laurel Gardens, Battle, East Sussex, TN33 0FD).

 

Best Regards

 

Philip

Dear Philip,

 

Thank you for your letter dated 15 April 2016. 

 

Unfortunately we are now not accepting cheques in the name of ACCOUNTS
CENTRE CY. 

 

Please make the cheque payable to AC ONLINE LTD, our automated reminder
emails do also specify this.

 

I have sent the original cheque back to your home address. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
