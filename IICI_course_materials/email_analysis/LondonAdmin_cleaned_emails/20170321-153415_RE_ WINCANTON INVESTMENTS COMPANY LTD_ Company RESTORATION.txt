Dear Aldo,

 

Further to my previous correspondence, please note that we are processing
the company restoration for the above mentioned company free of cost.

 

However, the outstanding late filing penalty of GBP 750 incurred on the
company for 2015 accounts will need to be paid to Companies while restoring
the company. You are requested to please make the payment as soon as
possible so that we may submit the documents to Companies House accordingly


Also, you have been requested to provide us your proof of address along
with the business activity & SIC Code so that we may verify your account.

 

We look forward to hear from you.

 

Best Regards 

 

Sarah
