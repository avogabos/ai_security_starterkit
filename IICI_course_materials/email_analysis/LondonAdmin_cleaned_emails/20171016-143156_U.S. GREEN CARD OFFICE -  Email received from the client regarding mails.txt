Hi,

Company Name: U.S. GREEN CARD OFFICE

Wallet Balance: 30.30

Client has topped up the wallet. For your information please check below
email received from the client:

"Payment done please send me mail out today and send me tracking number".

However, I have checked that company's Mail Forwarding Service is expired.
So sending an email to client to renew the service.

Thank you
