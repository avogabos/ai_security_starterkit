Dear Customer Support,

 

Thank you for your email and information.

 

If wet signature is urgently needed, I can sign the mandate form here and
notarize and apostille and send by post to your address. Once you receive
the original, Ms Pawar also signs the same, thus you can have the form with
both wet signatures of mine and Ms. Pawar's, and may send to the bank
accordingly to complete the transactions.

 

For that, I'll need you to provide me with the unsigned mandate form please
via email.

 

Or, you may send the original mandate form (signed by Ms. Pawar) by post to
my address, and then I can sign and notarize & apostille that form and send
you by post.

 

Kind Regards,

Semir Kimyonok
