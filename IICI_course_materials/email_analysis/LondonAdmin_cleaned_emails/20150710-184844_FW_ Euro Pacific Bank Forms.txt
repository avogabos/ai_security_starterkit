Dear Felix,

 

That is very unusual, that now you ask for some additional documents?

We have send out all requested documentation with DHL yesterday, which we
got from our client on Monday.

 

What shall we do now? I need to consult with him.

In case he refuse, can you send back all documentation and our advance
payment??

 

I'm also agent for Loyal Bank from SVG, and they haven't ask for such things
till now.

 

Waiting for your reply.

Kind regards, Mitja
