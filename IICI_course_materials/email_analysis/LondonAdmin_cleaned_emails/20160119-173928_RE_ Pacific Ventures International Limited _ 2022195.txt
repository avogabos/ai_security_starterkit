Hi Preeti, 

 

What you will need to do is get all the info from the Companies Registry
website and fill out the details. 

 

Please could you have this ready by Friday morning so I can send it off to
HK. 

 

I will be away on Monday and Tuesday next week so must be done before then.

 

Many thanks! 

 

Nadya
