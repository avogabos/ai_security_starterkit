Dear Sarah,

 

We would like you to please file the annual accounts for Business Resources Asia Limited. It is still a dormant and nontrading company.

It may occur a late filing penalty. Can you please how much they will be charged in this case?

 

 

We look forward to hearing from you.

 

Best Regards,




Asami Yamada
