Thank you for the application Nadya

The bank's compliance department would require for the attached Partner Information form to be completed for all known expected incoming and outgoing partners to the account in order to complete the initial review.
 
The bank would also require some form of supporting documentation, links, references, or proof of past business activity for the application, could something of this nature also be provided?
 
Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
