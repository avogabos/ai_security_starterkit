Dear Aela,
We now need to file the Annual Return without delay, would it be at all possible for you to send the forms for us to the Company Registry if I post them over to you? I would send it directly to them however in the past they have seemingly not received.
Your help would greatly be appreciated.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
