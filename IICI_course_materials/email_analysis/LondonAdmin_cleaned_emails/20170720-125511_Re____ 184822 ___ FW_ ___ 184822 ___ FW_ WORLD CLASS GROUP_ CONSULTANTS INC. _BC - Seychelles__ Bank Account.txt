Dear Keron,
Thank you for your email. With regards to the W8BEN-E form I will pass it on to client.
It seems that you didn't receive the original email that I sent with all the Identity documents back in late June when I emailed Wade originally. Please find attached again for your perusal.
We are still waiting for the Corporate Documents to arrive from Seychelles as soon as we will receive I will scan and email them over.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Nadya

Hi Samy,
Thanks for your email. Would you mind if you didn’t for the time being? We are the introducers so it will need to go through us first.
Is this something that you could potentially open an account for? If yes than I can collate all the correct required documents for you and then afterwards you could deal with him directly?
Many thanks!
I look forward to hearing from you.
