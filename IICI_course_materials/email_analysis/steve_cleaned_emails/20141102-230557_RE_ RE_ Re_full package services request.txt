Dear Steve,

Please find below my answers with \u201cA\u201d.

We are agents for UK and other offshore registries and also for HMRC in 
UK and we are required to complete due diligence of clients to whom we 
provide services. We confirm that we will protect your documents and 
will not use them in bad faith. We cannot provide any signed document.
A: This e-mail is considered a written confirmation by your side.

InfiniOffice Mail Only is not an email service, it is:
\u2022 Postal Mailing address within UK (street address)
\u2022 Postal Mail forwarding (at nominal costs for postage stamps only)
\u2022 Postal mail management
A: Thank you for clarifying this aspect.

Office pictures are not available for InfiniOffice Mail Only service. 
Office pictures are provided to customer who are interested in booking 
our meeting rooms.
A: I understand. I\u2019ll let you know if we\u2019ll need meeting rooms.

Green regards,
