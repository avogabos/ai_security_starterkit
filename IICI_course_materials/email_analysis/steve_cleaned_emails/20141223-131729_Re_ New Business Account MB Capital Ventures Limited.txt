Dear Steve,

you know what it is best to do I am sure you have a lot of experience whereas I do not.

This is the Business plan I had prepared but I don’t think it will be of any use now since it deals only the analysis of the ONE company only of which the shares I will have by 10% .
Pls have a look and tell me what to think.


I do not know if it is of any use now sending it to the bank so that to make clear that MB CAPITAL VENTURES will NOT be the money manager of any kind but PARTICIPATE as a shareholder of this joint venture.

Waiting for your advise in anticipation.

Regards,

Maria

Re: New Business Account MB Capital Ventures Limited
Dear Steve…
What can I say now?
I need an account you know that how can we proceed from now on?
This company will buy the shares of my Greek companies (involved in Human Resources, Construction and Energy) and will participate in the UK company as we have discussed.
Can you help me please with another bank?
Should I just state that I am going to buy the shares of the other companies and leave it to that?
I need to have an account number for that company ant it is the reason it has been set up in the first place.
Please help me…
Waiting for your response in anticipation….
Regards,
Maria
