Hi Steve

Do you mind sending me these docs for Global Tourism Investments and on the
email that you attch them state  'on behalf of Formations House' confirm
they are true

a)     Certificate of Incorporation

b)    M&A

c)     Registers (directors & members)

d)     Notice of Registered Office Address


GTI is taking some chares in another IBC company and they ask that theyy
are either certified by accountant or som esuch firm/lawyer, but I think if
they are cert true by youselves this will be enough - I can try anyway,
just attach the docs and state the above if you can...


Many thnaks

Phil
