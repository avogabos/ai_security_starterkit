Dear Angela
Please see following emails which
will give you complete details about initial price we gave you, for which
service payment was charged and when it was charged and how service was used.
On
19 August 2016
, Oliver
gave you price for company formation, apostille company documents (to be used
for bank account opening) and bank account processing:
1 BVI company + Euro Pacific Bank
Account  - 1600 GBP
1 HK Company + Euro Pacific Bank account – 1000 GBP
On
31 August 2016,
I, Steve
gave you message:
we have only charge payment for company formation and
applications are now in process. Payment for bank account and apostille
documents (required for bank account) will be charged once companies are ready.
- Orderno. 190825 – GBP 690 – BVI Company Formation and Registered Address
- Orderno. 190826 – GBP 695 – Hong
Kong Company Formation and Registered Address
We already
pay for apostille documents so you have to
​
send them to us because we dont have
anything in hard copies of this companie and we need our docu
ments in
original , apostille hard copies.
On
25 October 2016,
we
received your confirmation to charge payment for apostille and bank account
processing for Hong Kong Company.
- Bank Account : GBP 500
: Orderno. 191418
- Apostille Company
Documents : GBP 300 : Orderno. 191420
​
We already
pay for apostille documents so you have to
​
send them to us because we dont have

, apostille hard copies.
On
18 January 2016
, you
rejected our request to charge payment for Apostille and bank account
processing for BVI Company.
I hope you find above information
with reference to following attached emails satisfactory that:
-
We charged payment
for
company formation only and companies were registered in BVI and Hong Kong
-
We charged payment
for Hong
Kong company’s apostille and bank account processing. Apostille documents which
were submitted to bank for bank account processing, unfortunately bank account
application was rejected by bank. And as per our terms and conditions we do not
guarantee bank account and in case of rejection services charges are
non-refundable.
​
THE BANK ACCOUNT IS ALREADY OPEN
​
-
We did NOT charged payment
for Apostille and Bank Account Processing for BVI Companies. And in reply to
your today’s previous email asking for Aspotille BVI documents delivery to a
London address. This is the reason Apostille documents for BVI are not
available.
​​
​
WE WILL WAIT
UNTIL WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN OUR HANDS OF THE HK COMPANY TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS
WITH THE BVI
​
​
COMPANY....YOU CAN SEND THE DOCUMENTS TO THIS ADDRES IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LONGER AVAILABLE IN LONDON
