Dear
Steve 

 

I have realised, that I failed to inform you that the company is dormant, and
no trading as a limited company has been done with it since the day set up, I
run as a sole trader and wanted to protect the name of the company and have it
ready for when I am ready to run as a limited company, which will not be at
this present time.

 

So in this case I have no accounts to post, however please inform me what is
required for me to do to meet any legal and companies house requirements.

 

I will be calling your office on the 6th to pay any outstanding cost required.

 

Wishing you a Happy New Year.
