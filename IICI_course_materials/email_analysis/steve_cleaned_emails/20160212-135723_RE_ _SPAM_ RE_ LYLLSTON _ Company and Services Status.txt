Dear Steve,

 

Thank you for your information,

In fact when we had tried to transfer this amount to you (ref.188342, 125£)
via our credit card, it has been denied by the computer, therefore we remade
this transfer via our bank.

Nevertheless we thank you send us back this amount of 125£, by transfer to
our bank account:

HSBC

IBAN n° GB16MIDL40011332076594

 

Please let us know once youve done it.

Regards,

Eric Gilly
