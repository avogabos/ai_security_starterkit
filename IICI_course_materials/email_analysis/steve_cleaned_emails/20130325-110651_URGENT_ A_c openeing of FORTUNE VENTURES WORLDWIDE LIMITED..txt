Dear Dr Das Gupta,
 
Thanks again for your email, I am a bit confused as on the 
document you sent back you have said that you will purchase stock from India but 
on the original forms you said that you will be providing consultancy to 
businesses. What the bank are trying to establish is what the business will be 
doing. I  apologise if I have missed understood the business concept. RBS 
would like to do business with you but due to the compliance changes that the 
FSA have placed on banking we need to comply. I totally understand what your are 
saying but I just need to understand the business Model.
 
 
Kind Regards

Dear 
Mr. Raj,
 
Heartiest Greetings . This is the first time  my mail could 
enter your inbox . Is it a Good sign ?
I was given a set of questions and I have given my honest answers 
to it at least 6 to 7 days back.
 
Kindly 
let us know whether the Account could be opened or not ?? 
I have nothing against you  Mr. Raj 
but there are some questions which are childish.
A person starting  a business does not 
have the right to open his account in RBS ??? If not
it should be stated that only Experienced 
and OLD & RICH -Organisations will be entertained, in RBS.
 
I would earnestly request you to 
forward both my mails to your Head Office and who may be the 
person
concerned for his replies. I do understand and believe 
that you guys are presurrised with Targets and Volumes.
Is this the way 
????
 
 
Anyway 
I am eagerly waiting for your early reply and action.




With best regards and 
compliments.

Re  : Opening of our current account 
for Fortune Ventures Worldwide 
Limited.
 
Dear 
Mr. Raj,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta.
 
I hope this mail gets an entry to your 
inbox because till date all the mails I had sent to you bounced back for reasons 
unknown.
 
Hope 
everything is fine with you and your Business.
 
It was on probarbly  19th of Jan 2013 
we had an appointment with you at your Branch.
We had given all our documents for Opening 
our account. We were referred to you by  Ms. Charlotte of Formation 
House.
If I remember you 
were kind enough to complete all the basic formalities in front of us and told 
us that it would  take 10 days
to open the account.
It was on 7th of Februrary 2013 when you called me and asked for 
some other address proof. I had asked you what was the reason pf such 
delay,
I remember you 
 telling me  that only the fresh address proofs will be required and 
once you get it it would be very soon.
 
Till 
then I have been waiting and there has been no communication from your 
end.
 
Approx. after 45 days of waiting 
Mr. Raj Can I ask you some of my queries ???
 
1. Are we elligible to have an account in 
your Esteemed Bank ?
2. If 
Yes then why is such delay ??? If there is requirement of any document then why 
are we not informed about that ??
3. If the answer to the first question is No --- I would request 
you to spare a few spare moments of your precious time-- Dont you 
feel
    one 
simple line of mail stating ---- "The Bank is unable to accept your application" 
would be  concluding enough for us to not wait
   unnecessarilly ????  
It would have saved our TIME, which happens to be 
the costilest thing in this Palent Earth.  

4. I would 
request you to kindly retrun all the documents which we had given you for the 
account opening, at the earliest.
5. I do hereby authorise  Mr. Bruno Machado to collect the 
documents from you as per your suitability.
6. I hope that you will agree that our 
documents will be a burden for your Bank and we dont want that to happen so 
requesting you to
    kindly give back all the documents 
ASAP.
 
With stunning 
regards and best wishes.
