Is he a good reseller? Is so process but do :

 

We would need to change the customer id record to be for the director of the
company, and use his email only and make a note that it's a reseller

Please explain that this change in policy is not because we don't appreciate
his business but because UK compliance requirements have changed and we are
by law required to have the ID of the person who is paying or even
submitting the orde.

 

If he isn't happy with this then yes ask rehan to do the refund if via cxl

Id docs received in November 2016

 

Orderno. 190776
