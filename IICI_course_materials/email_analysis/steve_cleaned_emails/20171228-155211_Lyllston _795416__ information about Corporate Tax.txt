Dear Steve,

 

I come to you about the Corporate Tax:

We havent received the letter from Companies House mentioning the amount
due for the corporate Tax (2016/2017) which is of 49.20£.

Usually we receive it by the end of December.

 

On another hand I have try to rich you on the phone which as usual is
IMPOSSIBLE, is that normal???

 

I hope a quick answer,

Regards,

Happy New Year,
