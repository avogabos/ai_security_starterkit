Hello,

 

I'm looking for creation of company in "trusted" part of world, USA/UK, not
Belize etc.

 

Main purpose of company will be owning Czech ltd company which I'll sell to
it.

No transactions, no bank account, maybe nominee director for first year (it
is not too good two same names on both sides of legal documents).

 

What I must do to run this type of company, what I want and what it will
cost?

I'm able to do most of paperwork, if i know rules and see examples. No
traveling anywhere.

 

Regards,

Jan
