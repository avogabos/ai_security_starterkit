Dear Jon Lee

 

 

Thank you for your order for
UK company formation 'TRU GLOBAL MANAGEMENT' and thank you for providing due
diligence documemts.

 

 

However there are following
issues with documents provided:

 

1. Proof of ID - copy of
passport is fine.

 

2. Proof of Residentail
Address - Though we do not understand the language on the document but it seems
like it is mobile phone service bill, we are sorry but this document is not
acceptable.

 

Also it seems letter from
mobile phone service company (pink paper) and letterhead on which we can see
that address (white paper) seems like 2 different documents.

 

 

For Proof of Residential
address please provide following document:

 

 

- Last 3 months utility bills
(water OR gas OR electricity) - (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or
internet bill, these are not acceptable.)

 

OR

 

- Latest personal bank/credit
card statement. 

 

 

If the documents are not in
English then you need to have them translated and notorized. And send original
and translated copies.

 

 

Please provide us with above
mentioned document for proof of residential address so that we can further
proceed with your application.

 

 

If you require further
information or assistance you can contact me at info@formationshouse.com or
steve@formationshouse.com or 0044-(0)207-016-2727 Monday to Friday 11am to 7pm
GMT.

 

 

Regards
