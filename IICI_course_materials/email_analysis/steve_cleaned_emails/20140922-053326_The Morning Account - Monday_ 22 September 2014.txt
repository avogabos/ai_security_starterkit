Firms hitting cashflow problems
According to research from R3, the economic recovery is putting the future of some companies at risk as they try to meet increasing demand leading them into cashflow problems. The research shows that the number of firms that can only pay back interest on their debts and not pay off any of the capital, has grown to 154,000, nearly 50% more than in November last year. Giles Frampton, the president of R3, said that businesses were “experiencing the side-effects of growth." He explained that "overtrading and late payment can easily put businesses with bulging order books in a position where cashflow becomes a major headache. Businesses will get into trouble if they’re trying to run before they can walk and don’t get paid quickly enough for the work they’re doing.”

Labour pledges minimum wage rise
Labour has pledged that the minimum wage would rise to £8 an hour over the course of the next parliament if the party wins the next general election. Ed Miliband said the £1.50 per hour increase would be worth £60 a week, or £3,000 a year, for the lowest paid. In response to the pledge, Katja Hall, deputy director general of the CBI, said: “Raising wages in this way would put serious strain on businesses, particularly hard-pressed smaller firms with tight margins, which would end up employing fewer people.” Mike Cherry, who chairs the Federation of Small Businesses, agreed, saying it was a "huge ask" for many businesses.

European firms concerned over US "inversion" crackdown
European multinationals are said to be alarmed that their US divisions could get caught up in a US crackdown on tax-driven international mergers. The firms are concerned that attempts to limit the economic benefits of "inversion" deals would also increase their US tax and borrowing liabilities. Alex Spitzer, a senior tax executive at Nestle in the US, said: "The concern is that when they are going after inversions it will have unintended consequences, creating disincentives for inbound investment, which is important for our economy. It's a baby-and-the-bathwater issue."

G20 countries to swap tax information
G20 countries have agreed to start automatically exchanging tax information by 2018 in a bid to stop global tax evasion. At the meeting in Australia the finance ministers of G20 countries called on all financial centres to make the commitment by October's global forum meeting in Berlin and to support efforts to monitor global implementation of the new standard. “We support further coordination and collaboration by our tax authorities on their compliance activities on entities and individuals involved in cross-border tax arrangements,” the communique from the meeting said.

Tax subsidy scrutinised
The Treasury has estimated that a tax subsidy for the self-employed has risen from £1.7bn in 2011-2012, to £2.9bn this financial year. Oxford University professor of taxation, Judith Freedman, calls the increase “staggering”. Under the subsidy, the self-employed contribute less to national insurance as they are eligible for fewer benefits. Professor Freedman said: "There is a big subsidy being paid by employees to the self-employed. It is not a particularly well targeted way of encouraging certain types of activity."

Labour's plans could cost 375,000 jobs
According to the Centre for Policy Studies, which has studied the impact of ten key policies put forward by Ed Miliband, including raising corporation tax and income tax, Labour's plans could cost up to 375,000 jobs by 2020. The think-tank suggests that the plans could have a knock-on cost of up to £25bn of GDP over five years. Adam Memon, from the CPS, said: "While there may be reasons to increase taxes, perhaps to improve the fiscal balance or for redistributive purposes, the consequences for GDP and employment will be negative."

Devolution pledge stands
Downing Street has made it clear that David Cameron's Scottish devolution pledge does not depend on giving more powers to English MPs at the same time. Mr Cameron vowed to give tax-raising powers to the Scottish Parliament “in tandem” with moves to restrict Scottish MPs from voting on English matters. However, No 10 sources insist that “one is not conditional upon the other”. Labour leader Ed Miliband said he and other leaders must honour their promise to Scottish voters.

BRC hit over support of 2% rates cap
The British Retail Consor­tium has been criticised for appearing to support a rise in business rates in its latest policy document. In its Manifesto Milestones document, it details its plans to lobby politicians for a change to the tax on commer­cial premises, and calls for a "continuation of the 2013 Autumn Statement 2% cap 'rise'". However, the veteran retailer Bill Grimsey accused the BRC of ignoring the Labour Party's policy which is to freeze business rates. A spokeswoman for the BRC said: "The BRC believes the 2% cap on existing rates is an important short-­term measure but our real focus is on securing commitment to a process for moving towards fundamental reform."

Balls: More tough cuts ahead
The Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will tell the Labour party conference that more tough cuts will be on the way if Labour takes power. Mr Balls will lay out plans to slash ministerial pay, cap child benefit rises and scrap fuel allowances for the richest pensioners in his final conference address before the election. In a push to present the party as financially responsible, he will say: “Working people have had to balance their own books. And they are clear that the government needs to balance its books too. So Labour will balance the books in the next parliament. These will be our tough fiscal rules.” As part of the proposals, child benefit increases will be capped at 1% for the first two years of parliament, saving £400m. Additionally, ministerial pay will be cut by 5% - and then frozen until the books are balanced. Finally, the richest 5% of pensioners will lose their winter fuel allowance.

Referendum debate damaged confidence in the UK

Nearly half of finance professionals surveyed by Marks Sattin said they believed the referendum had damaged confidence in the UK economy. Dave Way, managing director of Marks Sattin, said that the independence debate "cast a shadow of doubt over the stability of the UK economy".
