Hi Rachel, 

 

The client can certainly open an account in Belize but the banks in Belize
are currently dealing with a crisis in restoring their US correspondence
banks.  At this point the bank account solution will not work in Belize.

 

As for the BVI, we are uncertain since we do not deal with BVI matters but I
can find a source that may be able to assist if possible. I will advise
after he clarifies the situation.

 

Best regards,

 

Mitch
