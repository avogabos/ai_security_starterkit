Dear Steve,

The renewal of the telephone lines has come for this year I have received a reminder to pay for something I have not had for the past 5 months!!!

You have mentioned that I will get free service for 3 months whereas I have not had a telephone line since mid july until today which makes it 5 months not 3 and we don’t know yet when the telephone lines are going to be up!

Please do confirm the billing details and amend the FREE PART as it is not free…I have already paid for it for the telephone lines and the fax I will not be needing anymore to pay for it never works anyway.
I will need an invoice for the telephone lines to pay for WHEN THE TELEPHONE LINES ARE UP AND RUNNING!!!! I can not pay for something I don’t have and don’t know when I will have!!!

in anticipation of your reply,

thanks in advance 

Best regards,

Maria
