Thanks Steve for your quick response.
01. At first I want a Merchant Account to accept Credit Cards and Debit Cards Payments online through a secured payment gateway which PCI DSS compliant in all manners.
I have a Paypal Business Account which could be my beneficiary account.
Can you please guide me through the requirements ?
02. Secondly... one of my client needs online gaming/betting or gambling license whcih allow them to run their customized gaming application world wide.
Please let me know if we can help them.
Regards
