Dear Steve,
even if I've not received an answer from your Company, I just made the bank
transfer of 90 GBP (127.00 €uros) to pay the Annual Return + filing fees
for my Company.
Remember that actually the CBMCo.Ltd is a "non trading" (dormant) Company.
Please, kindly provide to send the document to  HMRC and Company House.
When done notice me and send me a copy of it.

Here attached you can find the bank transfer order.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours

Edoardo Figliolìa
