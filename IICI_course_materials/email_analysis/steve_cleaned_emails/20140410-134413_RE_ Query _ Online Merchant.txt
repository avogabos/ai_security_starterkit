I can confirm that the merchant facility is only for software and the
related
services like market data.

It is not for trading purposes at all. We have had that question previously.

We are not involved in trading accounts for brokerage or anything like that.

need to get them to confirm whether the merchant facility will be used for
processing any payment for trading purposes 

or if the services provided are just subscriptions to their data platform
(not for trading accounts)

Expected annual turnover would be 420,000 USD per year.


The chargeback ratio is virtually 0%. We only see about 1 to 3 chargebacks a
year.

 

 

In order for your merchant account services to work for us, we cannot use a
hosted payment page, we need to have a lower level integration method where
we
pass the credit/debit card number through to your system.


Do you support this?

Can we also obtain a direct merchant account for our company?

 

 

 

question is about your gateway. Does it support passing the credit card
number from a website rather than displaying a hosted payment form? So
rather than having a hosted payment form, we would have our own payment form
where we input the credit card details and then pass them to the gateway.
