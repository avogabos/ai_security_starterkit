Re  : Opening of our current account for Fortune Ventures Worldwide Limited.
 
Dear Mr. Raj,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta.
 
I hope this mail gets an entry to your inbox because till date all the mails I had sent to you bounced back for reasons unknown.
 
Hope everything is fine with you and your Business.
 
It was on probarbly  19th of Jan 2013 we had an appointment with you at your Branch.
We had given all our documents for Opening our account. We were referred to you by  Ms. Charlotte of Formation House.
If I remember you were kind enough to complete all the basic formalities in front of us and told us that it would  take 10 days
to open the account.
It was on 7th of Februrary 2013 when you called me and asked for some other address proof. I had asked you what was the reason pf such delay,
I remember you  telling me  that only the fresh address proofs will be required and once you get it it would be very soon.
 
Till then I have been waiting and there has been no communication from your end.
 
Approx. after 45 days of waiting Mr. Raj Can I ask you some of my queries ???
 
1. Are we elligible to have an account in your Esteemed Bank ?
2. If Yes then why is such delay ??? If there is requirement of any document then why are we not informed about that ??
3. If the answer to the first question is No --- I would request you to spare a few spare moments of your precious time-- Dont you feel
    one simple line of mail stating ---- "The Bank is unable to accept your application" would be  concluding enough for us to not wait
   unnecessarilly ????  It would have saved our TIME, which happens to be the costilest thing in this Palent Earth.  
4. I would request you to kindly retrun all the documents which we had given you for the account opening, at the earliest.
5. I do hereby authorise  Mr. Bruno Machado to collect the documents from you as per your suitability.
6. I hope that you will agree that our documents will be a burden for your Bank and we dont want that to happen so requesting you to
    kindly give back all the documents ASAP.
 
With stunning regards and best wishes.
