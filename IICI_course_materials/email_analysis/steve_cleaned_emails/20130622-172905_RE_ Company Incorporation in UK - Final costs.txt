Dear Ahmed Khan

 

 

Thank you for your email.

 

 

It is not necessary to have to InfiniOffice Mail Service for company
registration purpose.

 

We can certainly set annual renewal charges for Registered Address to 50
GBP.

 

 

So we confirm the following

 

The total setup costs for Company Registration will be:

 

-          UK Company Registration 50 GBP (one time fee)

-          Registered Address 25 GBP (for 1st year)

 

To manage company the annual charges will be:

 

-          Registered Address Renewal 50 GBP

-          Online Company Administrator + Annual Return Filing 25 GBP + 15
GBP = 40 GBP per annum

-          Dormant Company Accounts and '0' Tax Return Filing 75 GBP per
annum

 

 

Let me know when you are ready to place the orders.

 

Regards

 

Steve

Thanks for your clarifications.

 

Referring to the final costs of company registration & annual charges for
maintenance, 

a.       Would the registration be an issue if we do not need the
InfiniOffice mail service.

b.      Can't the annual charges for registered address renewal be 50GBP as
its only your property that's is going to be shown on paper, considering
there's no physical cost involved.

c.       The other charges of registration & tax filings seems ok

 

If yes, pls confirm the following final charges:

 

The total setup costs for Company Registration will be:

 

-          UK Company Registration 50 GBP (one time fee)

-          Registered Address 25 GBP (for 1st year) then 100 GBP per annum

 

To manage company the annual charges will be:

 

-          Registered Address Renewal 50 GBP

-          Online Company Administrator + Annual Return Filing 25 GBP + 15
GBP = 40 GBP per annum

-          Dormant Company Accounts and '0' Tax Return Filing 75 GBP per
