Hi Steve,

 

Further to our telephone conversation earlier, I can give you the following
information:

 

My Company is Tassian Limited (Company Number SC108073), our registered
address is 2 Coltswood Road, Coatbridge. ML5 2AA. Our Company owns a
building that had 2 separate Premises Licences and these were in the name of
another Company that leased the building from us. This Company was called
Berri Limited and it was Dissolved on 5/12/2014.

 

When Berri Ltd was Dissolved both of the premises Licences went with it.

 

As the owners of the building we have an interest in restoring Berri Ltd so
that we can transfer the Licences to our Company.

 

We did ask Derek Ewart, who was the Director of Berri Limited, to get the
Company restored to the Register and he declined when he enquired as to the
amount of fees that Companies House was looking for. Below is the content of
the Email that Companies House sent to Derek Ewart.

 

Dear Sir 

BERRI LTD. - SC375148 

Thank you for your email of 27 February 2015. 

I note your comments and must first of all advise you that to be eligible
for administrative restoration the company should have been in business or
operation at the date of dissolution which, according to our records, was 5
December 2014. 

When completing form RT01 you must sign a declaration confirming that the
conditions for administrative restoration have been met.  If you believe
that any of the conditions have not been met, you cannot apply for
administrative restoration.  Your only option would be to apply to the
Court.  I can provide more information on this type of restoration if
required. 

If applying for administrative restoration, the following list of documents,
fees and any late filing penalties which have been incurred, must be
delivered to Companies House Edinburgh.  All documents must be in paper
format and all fees and any penalties must be paid in full. 

Form RT01 with filing fee of £100 
A letter of consent from the QLTR, please see their website at
<http://www.qltr.gov.uk%3chttp:/www.qltr.gov.uk/>
www.qltr.gov.uk<http://www.qltr.gov.uk/> for more information 
Annual Return form AR01 dated 19 March 2012 with filing fee of £40 
Annual Return form AR01 dated 19 March 2013 with filing fee of £40 
Accounts for the period ending 31 March 2012 
Accounts for the period ending 31 March 2013 
Accounts for the period ending 31 March 2014 

Late Filing Penalties will apply to all accounts which were late at the date
of striking off.  These penalties are calculated taking the time between the
date the accounts were due to be filed and the date the company was struck
off the register.  The penalties in this case will total £4500. 

Please note that depending on the date the application is received and
accepted for processing, you will also be required to deliver any other
documents which are due on or before that date. 

Form RT01 and the annual return forms can be downloaded from our website at
<http://www.gov.uk/companieshouse%3chttp:/www.gov.uk/companieshouse>
www.gov.uk/companieshouse<http://www.gov.uk/companieshouse>. 

The company will be restored within 5 working days of receiving all of the
above, providing all the documents are acceptable for filing. 

Please note that if any of the documents cannot be accepted and need to be
returned for amendment, or are missing, the application will be placed into
a pending file and the company will not be restored until all required
documents are received in a format acceptable for filing. 

I must make you aware that the last date for filing the annual return
dated19 March 2015 is 16 April 2015.  If your application for Administrative
Restoration is received after the due date, this annual return will also be
required for filing. 


Yours faithfully 

L. Trainer 
for Registrar of Companies 

I have asked Derek Ewart if he will sign the Licences over to my Company if
we proceed to a Court Order Restoration and he has agreed.

 

Will we have to pay all of the fees that Companies House are asking for if
we are going for a Court Order Restoration?

 

How long will the process take?

 

What other information do you need from me?

 

I look forward to your reply.

 

Kind Regards

 

 

Taz Asghar

(Managing Director)
