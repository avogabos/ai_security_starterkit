Dear Formations House,
Will the name "J and J Brothers Ltd" work then ?
Please see attached Identification Documentation.  Regrettably I have only taken black and white copies - as this was what was always used to be required.  Will that be sufficient this time ?  I will ensure we scan / copy in colour in the future.
Business Activity: TakeawaySIC code 56103
Annual Turnover: Circa £70k
PSC:  The Director and shareholder Mr "Xiujian Liu" will be the only PSC
Kind regards,
Richard
