Dear All,

 

Today was the end of the era led by my incredible father, a man of whom so
many looked up to, looked to for advice and support and looked for in
kindness. I know that as much as I will miss him, he will be missed by a
great many more, and in this I take comfort.

 

Tomorrow is a new Era, one that may feel different, and one that may suffer
with doubt. But I take forward all that I have gained from my father, and I
know each and every one of you will take something of him with you in your
hearts on our new journey together.

 

We will do him the greatest of all honours, and we will show him how well he
has led us to this day and how we are all able to stand together and lead
forward with all he has shown us, taught us and understood us.

 

If anyone wishes to play music this evening, play some Led Zeppelin in his
memory.

 

All my regards,

 

Charlotte
