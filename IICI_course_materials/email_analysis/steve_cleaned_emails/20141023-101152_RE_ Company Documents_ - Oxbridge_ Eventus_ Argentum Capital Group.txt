Good Morning Steve, Thank you for your e-mail. Please would you kindly charge the card with the details that you have. I have sent the CCA Authorisation Form for clarification, but in the interests of time, as the card was charged last time, I would be very grateful if you would attempt to charge it again on the basis of the details that you currently have. Please confirm once the card is charged and once the documents have been despatched. Tim
