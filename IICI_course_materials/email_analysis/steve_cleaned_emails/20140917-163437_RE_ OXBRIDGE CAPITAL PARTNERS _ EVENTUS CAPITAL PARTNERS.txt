Good Afternoon Steve, I hope and trust that you are well. Please would you confirm the charges for filing the Annual Returns in respect of the above and how quickly you could get this done. Many Thanks, TAS Gupta

Dear Steve 
 
I hope that you are well. I am just in the process of finalising bank accounts for Oxbridge and Eventus, (Argentum I have all the papers), however, I do not seem to have copies of the documents that you sent Karim which are now required in order to open Bank accounts. Could you kindly email copies of all of  these to me as a matter of urgency,
 
Thank You, Tim
