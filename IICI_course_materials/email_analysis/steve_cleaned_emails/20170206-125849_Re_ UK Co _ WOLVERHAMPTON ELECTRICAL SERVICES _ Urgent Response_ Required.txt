Thanks for your email re the proposed company. It appears that the payment did not go through and luckily that is good because I note that the Directors privacy box was ticked. This is not required, just the basic company.
Could you please amend the order so that I can make the necessary payment and Due Diligence information will follow.
regards Geoff Watts
