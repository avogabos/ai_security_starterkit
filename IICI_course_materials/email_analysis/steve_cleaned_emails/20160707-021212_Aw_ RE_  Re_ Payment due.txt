Dear Steve,
thanks a lot for your quick reply.
I hope, that the most important thing may be still possible. The name should be Pro 6 or
Pro6 Ltd.
Maybe you are able to help me a little bit more. We, the US MC-Pro LLC already had the above named Company, which was dissolved in 2014,
Company 5881307.
Will it be possible to reactivate it without any problems?
Which documents will be needed of the US company as director?
Are my personal documents all you need?
For the SIC Code, you are talking about this: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455263/SIC_codes_V2.pdf ?
The company does sercvices like consulting and support.
For instance: A house with 10 rooms will be hired and the rooms are letting in 3 pieces 3 rooms. The last room maybe our office. All in all this will be a dormant company of extraterritorial organisations.
I guess SIC 9999, 99000 or maybe 82990, but if possible let's hold it as open as possible.
Of course I need your feedback and have to check, how we arrange it the best way.
If you do have hintful tips, feel free to give advices.
Thank you very much in advance for your help.
All the best
Nadine
