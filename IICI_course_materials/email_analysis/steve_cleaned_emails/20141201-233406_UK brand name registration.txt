Hi Steve,

Hope this email finds you well.

As I mentioned in our conversation last time, I would like to register a
brand name in UK. Please assist me with that and let me know what documents
that I need to send to you.

Please acknowledge receipt of this email.

Thanks very much.

Best regards,
Rachel
