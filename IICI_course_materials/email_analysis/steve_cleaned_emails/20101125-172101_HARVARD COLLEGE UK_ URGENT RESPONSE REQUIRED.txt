Subject: HARVARD COLLEGE UK: URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED
From: CHR Group <info@chrgroup.org>
To: steve@formationshouse.com
CC: support@formationshouse.com

Dear Mr.Steve Smith

I have been trying to reach you but not being possible, I am in big trouble
and feel bounded by choosing Company Formation as my Agent.

I had applied for business starter pack and paid 99 GBP and also till date I
am unable to access my account. Secondly

My Company name is Harvard College UK Ltd
I would like to change it to Rosemary College UK Ltd

Also please note by nationality is Indian as I have already provided your
company with my passport.
Also today your company provided me with a link of Companies House where I
could see my company incorporation details but in column of Business type
nothing is mentioned. So please make sure that you mention it is educational
company because we dont want to charge VAT to students.

I dont have any letter head yet so I have written letter attached to this
mail.

Please let me know how do I have to pay. Also make sure I am given rest of
Business starter pack under the name of Rosemary College UK Ltd.

Regards
G.S.Sodhi
