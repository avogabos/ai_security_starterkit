Hi Steve,

 

We want to quick create the account and simplify process, so is confirmed Cui Yan will be the only operator on bank account. 

 

In this way do not need any more actions right?

 

Thanks!

 

Michael

Dear,

 

The compliance has reviewed the documents and wrote:

 

Both Chuntao Liang and Yan Chi signed the Bank Contract, however on the Corporate Resolution only Yan Chi was authorized to operate the account.

Can you please confirm if both of the clients are going to operate the account? If that's the case, please amend the Corporate Resolution content with both clients name.

 

Thank you.
