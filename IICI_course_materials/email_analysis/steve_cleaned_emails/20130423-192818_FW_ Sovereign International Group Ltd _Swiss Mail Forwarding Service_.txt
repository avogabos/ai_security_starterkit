HI Rebecca,

 

Thanks for coming back to me.  Ok, I think I see the issue- the address in
not correct in the sense that it is not complete.  Fundamentally there is no
post code, nor region and there are numerous towns in France called Chilly!

 

Please be instructed to advise your agents to change the information on file
as follows:

 

Martin Field

La Ruine

Quincy

Chilly

Haute Savoie 

France 

74270

 

These are the EXACT address details to be held please.  I will try this with
another test mail item.  I would be grateful if you can please ensure the
changes are made asap and confirm back.

 

Many thanks and regards

 

Martin
