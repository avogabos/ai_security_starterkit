Hi

I cannot provide any bill as all bills are included in the renting price. Please advice on other option.

Thanks

Dear Aleks

Raj has asked to ask you to send over a bill as proof

Also please be aware the other applications for the partner companies will have your previous address. They will be updated after you have your cards etc

Thanks
