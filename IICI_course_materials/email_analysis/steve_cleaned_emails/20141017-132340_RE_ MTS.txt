Hi

 

Can we offer Managed Tax Service to following:

 

 

 

Please let me introduce us briefly.

Our company is an IBC offshore company based in Seychelles. We are
specialized in E-Commerce services and we are selling genuine fragrances to
consumers through websites (primarely within the EU).
We have contracted an EU supplier which offers full fulfillment services
(including goods and shipments) to our customers and on our behalf.

The main issue is that this EU supplier has to calculate VAT on goods
(because they can't proof that the goods have left the EU).
They can sell us the goods with 0% VAT (intra-Community supply within the
EU), but then we need a valid EU VAT and company number & address.
This will save us about 20k Euro quarterly, if it is managed creatively.

We are very reluctant to VAT registrations because they give a lot of
obligations (administration etc.) and we have no knowledge of this. We don't
need an extra bankaccount because all transactions go as advance payment to
our EU supplier. Once a month, the excess (surplus) is paid to us.

So what we want is a legitimate, long-term solution (minimum 6 years) for
our EU supplier and us. Where it is important that we ourselves have no
obligations, except to pay for this service.

Can you please offer a full service package?
