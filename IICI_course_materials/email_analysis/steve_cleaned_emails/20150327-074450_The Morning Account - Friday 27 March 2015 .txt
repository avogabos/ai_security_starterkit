Ruling out tax rises is a risky move
The FT’s Vanessa Houlder argues that the pre-election tax pledges made by Labour and the Conservatives are risky both politically and economically. She quotes former chancellor Alistair Darling, who has stated that “no chancellor can tie his hands on tax.” However, it is also noted that the rises that politicians ruled out this week relate to two areas – VAT and NICs - where the tax burden is relatively light. Ms Houlder adds that a reforming chancellor might consider paring back some of the 1,140 reliefs in the tax code, as well as targeting the preferential national insurance treatment of self-employment income and employer pension contributions.

Gilbert: Tax means StanChart should look at leaving UK
Martin Gilbert, the second largest shareholder in Standard Chartered, has said that the bank should consider leaving Britain because of the tax burden on lenders. Asked whether the bank should move its headquarters to Singapore or Hong Kong, Mr Gilbert said: "I think it is something they should look at… I think the theory behind that is that they don't have any presence in the UK, so paying the levy there isn't as useful as it is for the other banks headquartered there." It comes after George Osborne last week announced a rise in a levy on banks' balance sheets, the ninth increase since it was introduced in 2010.

Corporation tax rhetoric is misleading
The Telegraph’s Matthew Lynn explains why rhetoric about multinationals “dodging taxes” is misleading, as companies are in fact paying an increasing amount of tax even as the rate of corporation tax falls. He cites ONS figures that show corporation tax receipts were up by 12% in February, compared with a 3.7% increase in tax revenues overall. For the 2014-15 financial year to date, corporation tax revenues have risen by 6.8%, a pace exceeded only by stamp duty. He goes on to argue that if lower rates actually generate more cash for the government, perhaps it is time to consider bringing them down further.

London house prices soften
House price falls in London’s more affluent central boroughs have started to spread across the rest of the capital’s most expensive areas following George Osborne’s stamp duty reform. Property values in central London's top 5% to 10% of the housing market, fell 4.3% in the 12 months to March 2015, while prices dropped 2.6% in south west London, including areas such as Clapham and Wandsworth.

Labour attacks Tories over VAT pledge
Labour has criticised the Conservatives over their promise not to raise VAT if they remain in power after the general election. David Cameron made the pledge a day after George Osborne had repeatedly refused to rule it out when appearing before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. Matthew Hancock, the Business Minister, revealed that the Tory leadership had taken the decision before Mr Osborne was quizzed by the MPs, leading Labour’s John Mann to accuse the party of staging a “political set up”.

Oxfam urges tax-dodge bill pledge
Oxfam is urging all political parties to commit to the introduction of a new Tax Dodging Bill within the first 100 days of the next government. The charity says such a bill would begin to rebuild public confidence in a tax system badly undermined by a series of high-profile revelations.

INDUSTRY

Sports Direct could face tribunals over USC redundancies
Sports Direct ignored repeated attempts by administrators to consult with staff who lost their jobs during the collapse of its fashion brand USC, according to administrator Philip Duffy. The Independent notes that the retailer could potentially face employment tribunals for not giving workers enough notice. Elsewhere, Andrew Crudge of Thomas Eggar writes to the Mail to argue that the government needs to implement suitable consequences for employers who breach laws designed to protect employees in the event of administrations.

Committee says FCA failings should be investigated
A report published today by the Treasury Select Committee is expected to describe the Financial Conduct Authority as a "dysfunctional" institution with failings serious enough to require special measures. In an 83-page report on a botched press briefing by the FCA that caused shares in the leading insurers to plummet last year, the committee will say that MPs should complete a detailed inquiry of FCA governance and culture after the election. "The evidence from this episode suggests that problems may still exist at the FCA. It is not yet clear to the committee that the FCA has fully grasped this." said Andrew Tyrie, select committee chairman.
