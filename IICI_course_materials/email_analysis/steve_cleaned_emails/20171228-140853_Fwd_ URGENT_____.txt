Dear Steve,
Can you please tell me what is going on?
I have no replies to dozens of e-mails I have sent concerning my telephone and fax numbers which are not working and
I have paid for the renewal
even though I have had no service for the past 6 months!!!!!!!!
I should also have received a code from the HMRC at the registered office in order to file my confirmation statement and even though my wallet has the cash for this I have not received it months now and its overdue!!!
What about a credit note maybe?????? For services NOT received??????
Please tell me what is going on, your lines do not answer, the online chat is always unavailable and no replier to any messages.
Have you closed the company?
Can someone please tell me what is going on?
In anticipation of your URGENT reply.
Regards,
Maria Banakou
