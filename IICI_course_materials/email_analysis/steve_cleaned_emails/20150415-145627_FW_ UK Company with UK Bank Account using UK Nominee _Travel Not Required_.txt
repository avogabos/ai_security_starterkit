Respected Sir / Madam,

 

We offer UK Nominee service For UK Company Formation with Guaranteed Bank Account Opening in UK via Our Bank Account Package.

 

This Bank Account Package will include

 

UK Company Formation, Bank Account Opening, VAT Registration, Nominee Director,Nominee Shareholder,Power of Attorney, Document Signing,Resignation Letter, Annual Return Creation / Submission, Annual Accounts Submission.

 

So Nominee will go to a UK bank and open the bank account on your behalf. This service is very popular in clients who are not based in UK or don't want to travel to UK for any reason. We will also apply for the company's VAT Registration.

 

Once the bank account is open we can add the beneficial owner to the bank mandate and if required remove the nominee from the account. 

 

The beneficial owner would control all aspects of the bank account and have the only access to the online banking and have the only debit card associated with the bank. 

 

The nominee will have no access to the account.

 

The nominee will sign an agreement that he/she holds the account in trust for the beneficial owner.

 

The uk company would have the uk bank using our nominee. you would be the beneficial owner and the beneficial owner will have all the access to the account. Online banking, debit card etc.

 

You will not loose privacy because it would be using our nominee services. Nominee would not have access to your account at any stage. 

 

Once the account is open should the beneficial owner wish he can be added on the bank mandate and the nominee can be removed if he so wishes. So we can remove the nominee and add you on bank mandate without you coming to uk.

 

Please note that the bank account service is guaranteed. if you don't get an account you will get a refund.

 

It usually takes 30 days before you will have the UK bank account ready for use. You will get the internet banking device at your local address.

 

Let me know if interested.
