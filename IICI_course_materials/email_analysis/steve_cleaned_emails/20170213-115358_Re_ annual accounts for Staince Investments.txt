Hello again :)

I hate to be annoying but time is going and we are close to our deadline 
with accounting. Could you please give me an update of how it goes? 
Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Alex

>> Dear Alex
>>
>> While reviewing your orders we found out that for Annual Accounts and Tax Return Preparation and Filing you have placed the order for OutSource Accounts Department service GBP 300, orderno. 192268, which is incorrect because this is service for preparation and filing of VAT Returns. For Annual Accounts and Tax Return Preparation and Filing, service is called Value Accounting GBP 300.
>>
>> Therefore, we are cancelling your orderno. 192268 and placing a new order for Value Accounting.
>>
>> If you require further information or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone or by live chat on our website.
