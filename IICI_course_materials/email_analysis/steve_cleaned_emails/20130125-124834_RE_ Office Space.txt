Hi

 

 

A new customer wants to use our Office Space, Desk Service for a month. 9am
to 8:30pm Monday to Sunday

 

He can book for a whole month if he thinks our quote is less expensive.
Otherwise he will need space as required to be booked on 1-2 hour notice.

 

Can we do this and what will be the quote?

 

His name is THUNVEER RAJA, 0754-032-8984, thunveer.raja@hotmail.com

 

 

Regards
