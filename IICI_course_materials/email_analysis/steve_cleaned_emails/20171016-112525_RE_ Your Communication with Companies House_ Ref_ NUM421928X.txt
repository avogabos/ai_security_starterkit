Dear Mr Smith

 Re – RATIONAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT LIMITED - 09626385

 If the above company is required on the Register, you can apply for it to be Administratively Restored.  To proceed with this process, Companies House will require the following documents:-

 1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk). 

 2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors – https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

 3) Confirmation Statement form CS01, (including Parts 1-4, which should be completed accordingly) for the review period ending – 03/11/2016, with the filing fee of £40.

 (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).

 4) Accounts for the period ending – 30/06/2016 

 Having checked our records, there is an outstanding late filing penalty of £375 due, on the 30/06/2016 Accounts.

 The company was struck-off for the non-filing of statutory documents i.e. the confirmation statement form CS01 for 03/11/2016, which should have been filed by 17/11/2016.

 Please note the confirmation statement, form CS01, for 03/11/2017, will be due by 17/11/2017.  If the company is not restored by this due date, this confirmation statement will need to be filed, as part of the restoration application. 

 Yours faithfully

 Ms H Jones

 Restoration Department.
