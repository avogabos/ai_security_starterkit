Dear Steve,
In regards to the bank opening issue, a friend of mine has transferred his water bills under my name so that I have a proof of address now. Please see the attached bill. Do you think that this would be sufficient for the bank account opening?
What other papers do I need to have ready except for those below?
Notarized copy of the Passport of Director(s) and all other signatories to the account.
Notarized copy of the Driving license of Director(s) and all other signatories to the account
Notarized copies of last 3 months bank statements

Kind Regards,
Svetoslav

Dear Svetoslav
Most of the applications are rejected by UK banks if company director is not a UK resident.
After proving that you have been doing good business with UK company then chance may increase to have a UK bank account.
The best option is to remove all director and shareholders and appoint only 1 person who is UK resident as the director and shareholder. That person can attend the meeting with UK bank and be a signatory for the bank account. In this scenario bank will then only discuss your business activity and expected annual turnover. Therefore you will higher chances to have a UK bank account.

Re: Query
Hello Steve,
Thanks for the info. What is the percentage of cancellations? We intend to operate through the UK company. For three years we work with the finest UK high end shops such as Harvey Nichols and they all want to pay us to a UK bank account that's why we need to open such.
Do you think that such an information would help in opening tha account?
If we assign a company director that has permanent address in the UK do we have bigger chances?
Thanks again.
