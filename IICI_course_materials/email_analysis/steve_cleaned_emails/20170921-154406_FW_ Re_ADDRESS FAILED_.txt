We just need that someone receive the envelope, after that, you can throw the envelope, is just a test!
However we will pay the 100 £ but we don't need more services about general mailing services, is just for this occasion because we didn't receive the HMRC letter from Formations House, ( and we need that prove of address), therefor we are doing this!!     Do you understand ????

Regards,
Carolina Cordero V.

Dear Carolina Cordero

Please confirm if package is for Formations House or THE BEST BUSINESS LTD.

If it is for THE BEST BUSINESS LTD then we cannot receive it because company is using our address only as Registered Office Address and not as Mail Forwarding Address.

Please note if company is using our address only as Registered Office Address then company cannot use our address for general mails. Registered Address service only allow official mails from Companies House and HMRC to be received. For general mails company would need additional service of mail forwarding address which is 'Virtual Office InfiniOffice Mail Only'.

If you require further information or assistance you can contact us by email.
