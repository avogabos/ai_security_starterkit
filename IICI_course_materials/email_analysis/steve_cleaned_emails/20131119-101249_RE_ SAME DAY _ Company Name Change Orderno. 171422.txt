Dear Steve

 

I've checked the letter properly, all the information that they needed was
received, however they need 1 more item.

 

Documents Required: To comply with the Companies Act 2006 you must also
submit the following documents to allow us to complete the change of name
for your company 

. Resolution to change company name

 

Support can help your draft this document, but it probably need the
customers signature.

 

With Regards, Tahir
