card/account

 

Delphine, I cancelled to companies last due to you not being able to supply
me with a fully managed nominated nominee/share holders last  week and I
have been waiting for my card to be refunded. I have sent emails which no
one replied to and called and I was told that the re fund will be done in a
few days and that was last week. I have been a client of yours in the past
and will continue to be on normal company set ups but I am finding that you
replied very quickly when I was giving you business but now you need to
return money to my card/account you are not doing it quickly. It should have
re funded immediately or within 24 hours. 
I do not want to give you a bad review or have to inform TRADING STANDARDS
and my Lawyer but unless this is resolved in the next maximum 48 hours I
will have no other alternative and on top of that you will lose me as a
customer. I expect a speedy reply and my money back within 48 hours. Regards

Steve I have gone now to a company I have used before who offer a full
service. Please cancel my two orders immediately as the structure doesn't
work for me. As mentioned I have used you before for normal UK companies and
will continue in the future but not for this kind of structure. Please
inform me when the money has been returned to my card. Thanks

Dear Paul Laing


Can you please give me detail information on the business activity for the
both companies so that I can discuss with our team and see if we can give
you a complete managed solution.


Regards

Steve

very quickly when I was giving you business but now you need to return money to
my card/account you are not doing it quickly. It should have re funded
immediately or within 24 hours.
I do not want
