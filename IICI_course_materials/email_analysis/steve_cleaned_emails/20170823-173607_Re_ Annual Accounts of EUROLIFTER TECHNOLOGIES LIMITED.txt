Dear
Ekaterina
Thank you
for your email.
Please note
that as per due process it takes us 10-15 working days to prepare annual
accounts and tax returns. Once prepared these are sent to client for approval, so
it is obvious that using normal service ‘Value Accounting’ for GBP 300/- will
not achieve the deadline of 31
st
August 2017. Therefore you should order
Extreme Accounting service for GBP 500/- in which we will process annual
accounts and and tax returns in 5-7 working days.
If you
require further information or assistance you can contact us by email.

Steve Smith

Re: Annual Accounts of EUROLIFTER TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED
Dear Steve,
please find attached statement of EUROLIFTER TECHNOLOGIES
LIMITED
for preparing annual accounts.
Maybe client will pay for Extra accouting. But last day is
29th of August for
efile accouting. Would
accountants prepare extra accounting for 5-6 days?
Please write me how much money do we have at our id.
I guess we need tranfer you more money.
Thanks in advance,
Ekaterina.
