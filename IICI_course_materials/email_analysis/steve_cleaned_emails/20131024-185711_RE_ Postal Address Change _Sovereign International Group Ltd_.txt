Hi Steve,

 

Courier shipments are paid for separately and prior to forwarding.

The cheapest but still reliable option would be TNT (it is part of the Swiss
Post). The shipment cost will be 90 CHF (ca. 73 Euros as of today).

Other couriers like DHL, UPS or FedEx will be much more expensive.

Hi Steve.

 

You are really early - we have got it already (in the morning) ;-)

A DHL shipment going direct to the agent in Switzerland [i.e Sovereign

the Zurich Aargauerstrasse address as per your advice previously.  The DHL
tracking number is 5984527743 and this correspondance is important and I
need this forwarding via post to the new address I gave you in South Africa
please.   Just wanted to confirm this.

 

Thanks and regards
