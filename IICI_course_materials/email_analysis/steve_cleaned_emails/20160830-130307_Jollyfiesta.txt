Not sure whose customer this is

 

He came in last week without an appointment to discuss options with his
existing business

 

He basically needs the uk company to have a different director to the
existing

I gave 2 options

1.       He finds and nominee and we will do all paperwork and filing
including the trust deed for 500

2.       Managed company for 6

 

Please send him an email twith these options

 

 

Thanks

 

 

Kind Regards,
