Steve... let me share
CFI's Company Formations
'secret of success' with you
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's the passion!

The Commitment. And the lengths that we are all prepared to go to bring you the 
best company formations service in Ireland... guaranteed!

But that's only part of it.

The real reason why CFI can so consistently guarantee you the very best company
formations and company secretarial service in Ireland is because we are passionate
about what we do for you.

Not for us in CFI the almost routine impersonal 'tick here and email it back to 
us' company formations service that is sadly becoming all to prevalent in Ireland
nowadays. No. no! Ours is a 100% personal service.

We are a 'hands on & people' company. 

We take great pride in the personal service that we offer you. 

Between us, we have centuries of experience in Company Formation 
and Company Informationwork in Ireland. We offer you a level of experience and 
expertise,Steve, which few, if indeed any, of our competitors can match.

Next time you have a company formations requirement, or a company secretarial problem,
or a company shareholding question that needs answering, in the St. Valentine week
that is in it we'd really LOVE to hear from you personally, 
Steve.

Yours sincerely,


Sean Kavanagh
Managing Director

PS Steve, any time you like, you are always welcome to call me personally on 01
664 11 11. Just ask for me by name and, as you can see from my... eh! heavenly ...
picture at the top of this Ezine, I can happily go to Hell & Back to deliver you
with another winner!

Company Formations International Limited | 22 Northumberland Road | Ballsbridge | Dublin | 4 | IrelandSteve... if you ever need to restore a company, we can offer you instant expert advice
Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
Dear Steve
Keeping you fully up to date
Not many people are aware that in
the year ending 25th February, 2016 as many as
510 companies were restored to the Irish index of companies. That's on average more than one company a day -
every day!
This figure is broken down as follows:
383
were restored by way of
Form H1
- application made less than a year
after strike off.
102
*
were
restored
by way of application to the High Court
14
were
restored
by way of Form
H1 OMC
- application by an 'owner management company'
11
were
restored
by application by a
Creditor
to the Circuit Court
0
were
restored
by way of Form
H1R
- application to restore where struck off by Revenue
*
Of the 102 High Court applications, 6 then went on to be put into Receivership after they had been restored.
Karen Corcoran

If a company is making an application to be restored within twelve months of being struck off or dissolved it can apply directly to the Companies Registration Office. This will avoid the necessity of engaging a solicitor and barrister and seeking a hearing in the High Court.
