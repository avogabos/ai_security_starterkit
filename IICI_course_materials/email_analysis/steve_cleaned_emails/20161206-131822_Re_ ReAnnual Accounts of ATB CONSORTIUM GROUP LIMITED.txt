Hello,

is there any news about ct return for ATB CONSORTIUM? More then a month has
passed.
Client is little bit  calm now and even think to stay under our
administration but I think next week he will ask where is ct return? I
should explain him this situation and answer about ct return.

He payed corporate tax for his company about 10 days ago. I will send you
swift tomorrow just for your files.

Thanks in advance.
