It is
Offshore compliance Pack Hong Kong, this was also used for Staff Travel Voyage
Limited.
While
forming offshore company you are required to provide your own address to show
the location where you will manage company books. And if you do not wish to
provide your address for this purpose than you can choose to have Offshore
compliance Pack Hong Kong.
If you do
not wish to use Offshore compliance Pack Hong Kong than please provide me with
your own address and I will replace the order for you.
