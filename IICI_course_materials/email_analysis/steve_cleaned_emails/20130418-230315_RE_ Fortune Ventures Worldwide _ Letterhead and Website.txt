18.04.2013 Dear Mr. Steve, The design seems OK . You can go ahead with a check from your side with the brightness and colour contrast of the design. I would be grateful if you could just upload the Index Page and contact us page immediately. The rest of the pages you can show as "Under Updation".   In the address page please do not put the Hong KOng address for next 15 address. Kindly let me know if it is possible ?? You can take the help of our present site : www.royalfortuneventures.com for the specific tabs and putting the address of the Kolkata office also. Please get back if you have any queries. Thanks
 With sincere compliments & best wishes....
