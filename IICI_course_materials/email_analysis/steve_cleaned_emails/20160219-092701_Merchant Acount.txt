Hi Steve,
I believe you have been passed details of my online enquiry today.
I am in the process of setting up my business which is going to be carrying out disclosure checks on potential employees of companies.
 
I have agreed terms with WorldCheck Sentinel for access to this.
 
I expect to be doing 300 background checks per week in the future maybe starting of with about 200 in the 1st instance.
 
I have been waiting for a merchant account to be approved which it was on Thursday but they now say they can only process in USD, as we are going into the UK market this is not ideal.
 
the cost per transaction is going to be between 40-60GBP so taking it on the lowest amount(our target is actually 48.00 to start with rising to 60.00 in future) so this gives an amount of 34,000 GBP per month rising and 416,000 GBP per annum.
 
I was in the process of doing the online formation of the business and taking the package to include the merchant facilities but stopped the process as I was unsure if the merchant facilities are guaranteed.
 
We have the website built and ready to go online it is just a case now of getting merchant facilities.
 
I am based in Thailand so all communication can hopefully be done between 9am and 3pm UK time.
 
Many Thanks

yours,
Craig Kirkwood
