The charges for these services are as follows

Dear Angela
Please that Hong Kong company is in process of registration
however we are there is one problem and due to that application is in pending.
The Hong Kong registrar is not accepting special characters in company name and
company name by you have special characters as ‘brackets’ – ‘CONDUCTORES Y
CABLES GLOBALES (CONDUGLOB) LIMITED’. Please confirm how company name should be
registered with special characters?
For example, company name can be registered as ‘CONDUCTORES Y
CABLES GLOBALES CONDUGLOB LIMITED’.
Waiting for your confirmation on the company name.
Regards
Steve…

Dear Angela
Passports are fine, thank you.
Hopefully we will complete Hong Kong registration within 5
working days.
For BVI please have the form filled by notary public and send it
to us as soon as possible so that we can further proceed with BVI company
registration.

Dear Angela
Again attach is the form which
is to be filled by your Notary Public Office required for BVI company
formation.
For notarization documents must
be stamp by public notary in Dominican Republic. Also you need to arrange
English translation of these documents and translation document must also be
notarized.
Regarding HONG KONG it is in
process but on hold, I was told by our Support Team that you have been emailed
to resend copies of passports because a single digit of passport number is
missing. Please check your email and other emails
messin@marquezsarraff.c
om
and
julian@marquezsarraff.c
om
if you received
the email from
support@formationshouse.c
om
. Please also check
the SPAM/JUNK section and arrange passport copies as required.
And
if required you can speak to Mr. Shawn or Ms. Rachel in our support team at
+44-207-016-2728
from 9am to 5pm
Monday to Friday.

Steve…
