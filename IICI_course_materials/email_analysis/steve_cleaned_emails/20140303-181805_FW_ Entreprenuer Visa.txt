Dear Bodium

 

Thank you for your e-mail

 

I can offer you a very simple and effective business solution according to
your situation

 

If you have access to 100,000 GBP funds in your account, we can help you

 

We can offer you 

 

·       Express company registration (or transfer)

·       UK company structured in compliance to apply for Entrepreneur Visa
program in the UK 

·       Fully Structured Limited Company with You appointed as director and
shareholder

·       UK company accounting service for 1 year 

·       Appointment of ourselves as the company accountants

·       Professional Business Plan for use as part of your Visa Application

·       Professional website and complete e-commerce store for the new
business 

·       UK Virtual Office service for 3 months (UK phone, fax and business
address)

 

We can arrange a partner/investor who can invest or partner 100 K GBP with
you in order to apply for 

this visa program in the UK.

 

We charge 5000 GBP for this express service and you need to apply for the T1
visa program from

your home country

 

The 5000 GBP does not include any assistance in the application process
other than providing 

the corporate documents you needs while applying directly on the UKBA
website

 

You can change the business activities after so long as the business where
the money was 

invested continues

 

We have a number of other entrepreneurs who also only have £100,000 and
therefore need 

a team, and we will look to see which person would best fit. 

 

Two families can apply for this visa program under one company.

 

To work in an Entrepreneur team, the other entrepreneur must also stay in
the business for 3 years 

or 5 years if extended. 

 

After this period you and the other person would need to discuss whether you
can work together.

 

There are no other fees aside from the any services you need from us as the
business operates such as 

Payroll or company filing management. None of these are required at this
moment as for the £5,000 we

will provide our name as the accountants to the business on the business
plan.

 

If you would like to have a solicitor to guide you through the actual
application process, we have relationships 

with a number of immigration solicitors that we can recommend 

 

Please let me know your availability so I can fix an appointment for you to
finalize this deal in our office and 

start processing immediately

 

Best regards

 

Oliver
