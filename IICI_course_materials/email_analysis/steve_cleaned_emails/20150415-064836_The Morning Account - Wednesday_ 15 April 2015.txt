Tories set out tax plans
Launching the Conservative manifesto, David Cameron has outlined plans to push up the income tax personal allowance to at least £12,500 by 2020, and legislate for a “tax free minimum wage”. The Conservatives will also offer 30 hours of free childcare a week for pre-school children, which Mr Cameron said would be funded from a £1.4bn cut in the pension tax relief offered to those earning more than £150,000 a year. The rest of the money raised by the measure would be used to fund the IHT cut for estates worth up to £1m. The IFS estimates that raising the income tax personal allowance and introducing a tax-free minimum wage would cost at least £3.7bn a year, while the CBI said that a better priority would be to increase the threshold at which individuals pay NICs.

Greens outline radical tax plans
The Green Party has launched its manifesto with proposals for a “Robin Hood tax” on banks, a wealth tax on individuals with more than £3m, a bigger crackdown on tax avoidance and a 60p top rate of income tax. Party leader Natalie Bennett said tax increases would fund 1m public sector jobs on a living wage and a larger HMRC to tackle tax avoidance. Corporation tax would go up to 30%, the fuel duty escalator would be restored and capital gains tax allowances abolished.

Murphy attacks Tories over English income tax
Labour’s Jim Murphy has attacked David Cameron’s plan for an English-only rate of income tax. The Conservative manifesto contains a pledge to give English MPs a veto over financial matters if they affect England only, provided that relevant powers, such as control over income tax bands and rates, are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. However, Mr Murphy claimed it marked the end of the consensus reached by the cross-party Smith Commission, which agreed to devolve the taxes, and would destroy centuries of tradition by preventing Scottish MPs voting on UK Budgets.
The Daily Telegraph, Page: 6<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11536486/Jim-Murphy-accuses-Tories-of-brutal-betrayal-over-English-income-tax.html>    The Press and Journal, Page: 11   The Scotsman, Page: 4, 5

Minister suggests running tax strategies past nurses
Nick Boles, the enterprise minister, has urged businesses to use NHS workers as a sounding board to establish whether complicated tax dodges are acceptable. During election hustings at the British Library organised by Grant Thornton, Mr Boles suggested: “Go to a nurse in your local hospital and explain it to her for three minutes. If she thinks it’s reasonable, it’s probably acceptable but if she gets angry, it’s not okay.” Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Vince Cable of the Lib Dems also spoke at the event, and all three agreed that criticism of legal tax avoidance has been justified.
The Times, Page: 38<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/tax/article4410808.ece>   The Guardian, Page: 21

IHT about principle rather than practice
The Times’ Patrick Hosking suggests that the Conservatives’ proposal to raise the IHT threshold has generated a surprising amount of interest, in light of the fact that very few people are ever troubled by the tax. He points out that last year, only 26,000 estates paid any IHT at all. He adds that the tax raised just £3.4bn last year, whereas VAT delivers 31 times as much and income tax 46 times more. The reason why people feel so strongly opposed in principle to paying IHT, he suggests, is because they regard it as state-sponsored confiscation of private property that has been taxed already.

Non-dom attack could see mass exodus
James Ashton examines the implications of Labour’s pledge to scrap non-dom status. “If Ed Miliband demonises the wealth creators, then they will invest elsewhere,” says Luke Johnson, the co-founder of the Centre for Entrepreneurs. Simon Walker of the IoD also warns: "There is a serious risk that large numbers of the international financial community, who have headquartered themselves in London at least in part because of our tax regime, will now exit the country." Finally, David Kilshaw, EY's head of private client tax, predicts the advent of "boomerang doms" who will leave the UK for a few years to refresh their tax status before returning.

Football clubs’ ownership raises tax questions
The Guardian reports that almost one in three of the 92 Premier and Football League clubs are now substantially owned overseas, leading to the English football leagues being accused of allowing ownership structures of clubs that could be used for tax avoidance. The Tax Justice Network, which has produced a report titled The Offshore Game, says the ownership of football club shares via offshore companies means there is “huge potential for tax avoidance” when the clubs are sold.

Five factors to determine CFOs’ future success
The ACCA and the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) have published a report which lists five factors that they believe will influence the future role of the CFO: economic volatility, risk, data, technology and talent – all of which they say financial leaders will need to both understand and act on in order to succeed. “The external environment is going to be hugely challenging for CFOs. Certainly we can expect no let up on economic volatility, and there’s simply much more risk to deal with, but when you overlay this with challenges around transformation of business models and so on, it’s a difficult future terrain for most finance chiefs,” said the ACCA’s corporate head Jamie Lyon.

HMRC to lose out over Phones4u collapse
PwC, administrator of the collapsed mobile phone retailer Phones4u, has revealed that secured creditors are on track to receive between 20p and 24p in the pound from the winding up of the business - double the amount originally expected. It means that American distressed debt funds that snapped up bonds in Phones4u after its collapse last year could recover at least 20 times more than the British taxpayer. Unsecured creditors including HMRC are set to receive only 0.4p for each pound they are owed.

ECONOMY

Mortgage data highlights election uncertainty
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has said that the number of mortgages taken out by first-time buyers and those moving house fell by 16% in February on a year-on-year basis. General election uncertainty amplifying the typical start of year lull in housing activity was likely to blame, the CML said. Lending to buy-to-let investors, however, grew 11% - with 15,900 worth a total of £2.2bn approved over the month. Separately, figures from the ONS showed that the average price paid for a home by a first-time buyer hit £205,000 in February, up 7.4% on the same month last year.

Inflation rate remains at zero
The rate of inflation remained at a record low of 0% in March, according to the ONS. Cheaper clothing and footwear, offset by a rise in petrol prices, helped to maintain the rate at 0% for a second month, official figures show. The figure was the lowest rate of CPI inflation since estimates of the measure began in the late 1980s.
