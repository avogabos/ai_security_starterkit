once we supply the company, and the account is transferred we are not liable or responsible for anything further with he company, it will be up to the customer to maintain good relations with the bank.

 

once the bank become aware of what the company is doing (as readymade companies are typically considered consultancy businesses by the bank) the bank is likely to wish to close the account until a licence from FCA is obtained . the virtual currency business is still not regulated enough for most uk banks to be comfortable with but there are circumstances where they accept it based on the trading history of the owner or if some regulation has been obtained.

 

if the company maintains invoices etc for consultancy services thre babk will usually be ok

Subject: UK Readymade company with already opened bank account

If I buy the UK company from you, will the bank account be closed after new owners take control? 

 

I know its very hard for open a company for bitcointrading. Any suggestions on how to run this kind of company, especially onthe bank side?




Kind Regards,
