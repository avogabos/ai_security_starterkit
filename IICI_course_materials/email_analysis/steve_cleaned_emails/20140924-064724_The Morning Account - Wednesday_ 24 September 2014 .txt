Miliband outlines taxes to fund the NHS
Labour leader Ed Miliband has set out plans to create a £2.5bn fund for the NHS to be paid for by taxing expensive homes and the tobacco industry, and cracking down on City tax avoidance. The party said a “mansion tax” would raise £1.2bn a year from the 108,000 homes which are estimated, according to Zoopla, to be worth in excess of £2m. The £2m threshold would rise in line with property prices to stop more homes being dragged into the tax. However, Rob Perrins, managing director of the Berkeley Group, said the "misconceived" idea was a tax on aspiration, while the Telegraph’s Allister Heath accuses the party of having “lost touch with economic reality”. Labour also said it would stop hedge funds avoiding £500m of tax on shares by having them held by investment companies. Industry experts responded that Labour's plans to raise funds by closing tax loopholes are likely to raise complex policy issues. Heather Self of Pinsent Masons said the proposed measures would add to the complexity of the tax system, while Aidan Sutton, a partner at PwC, warned: "It is very hard to assess how much could actually be raised." Jack Inglis, chief executive of AIMA, added: “It is misleading to describe this as a measure targeted specifically at hedge funds. This is a well-known investment strategy that is utilised by all levels of market participants.” Anita Monteith of the ICAEW said Labour's revenue estimates from the measure were “optimistic”, but added it was right to identify the issue as a problem.

Time for London to run its own taxes
Simon Jenkins calls on Boris Johnson to make the case for London to be given the power to run its own taxes in the wake of the Scottish independence referendum campaign. He cites a recent report from a commission, chaired by the LSE’s Tony Travers, which suggested that a wide range of taxes be delegated to London's various governments.

Tax cuts the way forward?
The Daily Telegraph’s Matthew Lynn examines how New Zealand-style tax cuts could provide a blueprint for reviving the economy. He notes that in 2010, the top rate of tax was reduced from 38% to 33%, and taxes were cut along the income scale. Corporation taxes were cut by two percentage points. He adds that the country has since witnessed “one of the most robust recoveries in the developed world.”

Tesco fast-tracks new FD
Tesco’s new finance director, Alan Stewart, has been parachuted into the role two months ahead of schedule after the supermarket uncovered an accounting error totaling £250m. Mr Stewart was due to join in December after quitting Marks & Spencer in July, but has now been released from his contract early. Tesco announced yesterday it has engaged Deloitte to conduct an independent investigation into how it overstated its first-half profits to such an extent. The Serious Fraud Office is reportedly following events closely as Tesco investigates whether deliberate manipulation was involved in the creation of the illusory profits. The Times reports that auditors have warned leading retailers, including Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, that they could also be at risk of a Tesco-style accounting fiasco. PwC, which audits Sainsbury’s’ accounts as well as Tesco’s, highlighted issues over how Sainsbury’s accounts for its commercial deals with suppliers. KPMG, Morrisons’ auditor, also raised income from suppliers as a principal risk in its audit of the grocer’s accounts in March.

HMRC mistaken in issuing demands
The Daily Mail reveals that thousands of businesses have been sent threats of fines after HMRC wrongly accused them of failing to file their accounts on time. HMRC admitted the penalty warnings, relating to information about staff benefits and workplace perks, had been posted in error and that the mistake had occurred because it had not updated its own computers. Elaine Clark, managing director of CheapAccounting, said: “This highlights precisely why HMRC cannot be trusted with its proposed new powers.”

Inversion clampdown hits pharmaceutical firms
Shares in AstraZeneca and Shire have fallen more than 5% following an announcement by the US Treasury that it has introduced measures to “curb” inversion deals. Under the rules, unveiled by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, it will be harder for US companies to meet the requirements for an inversion and harder for those companies that do invert to access their overseas cash piles without paying taxes. According to the Telegraph, experts believe that the shake-up could now pave the way for a European buying spree in America. “The legislation encourages activist investors and foreign companies to work together to make takeover bids for US multinationals with large amounts of cash outside the country,” said Michael Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute.

Charity calls for bankruptcy changes
Research from the debt charity CAP (Christians Against Poverty) shows more than 300,000 adults with severe debt problems in the UK are finding themselves unable to repay their creditors yet are also unable to afford bankruptcy fees that could alleviative their situation. CAP, along with R3 and others, is now calling on MPs to enable more people to use Debt Relief Orders, which carry a £90 fee compared to the £705 required for bankruptcy. At present Debt Relief Orders can only be applied for if a debtor owes £15,000 or less.

Start-ups are struggling
New research from RSA has suggested that although Britain is enjoying a boom in start-ups, too many are struggling to get beyond their early stages. RSA found that businesses with fewer than ten employees are the only category of company to have grown since 2000. In contrast, the insurer said that since 2005 the proportion of fast-growing businesses had “plummeted” across all regions other than London.

Small firms more confident
The Federation of Small Business’s measure of confidence – the Small Business Index – has reached 41 points for the third quarter, the first time it has reached such a high level. Three fifths of the firms polled expect to grow in the next 12 months, while a third expect turnover to increase and almost a fifth predict a rise in their profits. The boost in confidence follows recent research from Lloyds Bank Insurance that revealed one in four UK employees want to set up their own business.

Andy Willox, Scottish policy convenor of the Federation of Small Businesses, has said the organisation is optimistic about economic progress post-referendum.

LITRG wants robust guidance
The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group is calling on the Government to ensure that the pensions guidance service is sufficiently robust, with much tighter regulation than currently proposed. Anthony Thomas, Chairman of LITRG, stated: “We are very concerned that the short timescale for implementing these changes means that there will be a lack of adequate and fully trained staff to provide this service. Furthermore, consumers may assume that the guidance is actually advice and so not adequately explore their options.”

Pensions blunders
A Daily Mail investigation has revealed scores of incidents where clerical mistakes by insurers have caused lasting damage to savers' plans. The errors include miscalculating pension income payments, misinforming customers their savings are worth hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they are, and incorrectly giving advice about taking a pension as a lump sum. A Financial Ombudsman spokesman tells the paper it is down to the Financial Conduct Authority to fine firms who make repeated errors.

Mortgage lending down, business lending up
August 2014 saw the fewest mortgages approvals in a year by banks and building societies, although lending to small businesses moved into positive territory for the first time in twelve months. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchases fell from 42,715 in July to 41,588 in August. Separate research from the Council of Mortgage Lenders also indicated an increase in the number of competitors entering the mortgage market, which has seen the share of the six largest lenders drop to 72% from 84%. Meanwhile, net lending to businesses grew by £1.5bn in August, after a fall of £900m in July.

Public borrowing at £11.6bn in August
Official figures from the ONS have shown that Government borrowing stood at £11.6bn last month. Total borrowing for the year stands at £45.4bn, some 6.2% higher than the same period last year. Economists said the poor start to the year had put at risk the Treasury’s official target of reducing borrowing to £95.5bn in 2014-15 from £105.8bn in 2013-14.
