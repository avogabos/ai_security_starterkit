TAX

 

VAT U-turn on solar tax 

George Osborne has agreed to an amendment to the Finance Bill that will allow the Treasury to overrule an EU requirement for solar firms to pay 20% VAT from August, rather than the current 5%. Solar Trade Association spokeswoman Leonie Greene said a failure to renegotiate the VAT rate would be “very bad news” for domestic solar demand, which is a fifth of what it was this time last year. Ministers have also said they will not oppose calls to scrap the so-called "tampon tax" when the issue comes to a vote in the House of Commons. Eurosceptics backed the amendments to highlight the EU's role in setting indirect tax rates, however, officials dismissed suggestions that the Budget votes could temporarily put Britain in breach of EU law. Addressing the House of Commons on the issue, the PM said he understood that the EU's rules on taxation were "inflexible" and could see how they can “cause considerable frustration". "We said we'd do something about it and we have done", he declared.

Employer shareholder scheme attractiveness dims 

The Evening Standard’s David Prosser speaks to Wilkins Kennedy’s Jemima Jones about how changes to the employer shareholder status scheme announced in the budget will effect business. The scheme allowed employers to give free shares up to £50,000 to employees and allows profits on the shares if they are sold to be tax-free. However, the Chancellor is introducing a cap on the amount of capital gains employees may make from the scheme without being potentially liable for capital gains tax. Any shares awarded after Budget day last week, 16 March, will be subject to a £100,000 threshold – tax will potentially be payable on profits made above this level. Describing the move as significant U-turn, Ms Jones reflects: “This capital gains tax cap makes the ESS far less attractive than it currently is and we can expect to see a reduction in the number of new schemes being implemented”.

IFS echoes Duncan Smith’s claims of unfair Budget

A report published by the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) appears to add weight to claims by Iain Duncan Smith that the Chancellor’s Budget is unfair on the poorest. The IFS said that tax and benefit changes will see many households in the bottom 20% of earners lose up to 12% of their income by 2019, while households in the top half of income brackets will be no worse off. The poorest pensioners will be at most 2% in the red, the IFS added. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: “Raising the threshold for paying higher-rate tax is clearly helping people in the middle- and upper-income brackets, while the cuts to benefits reduce the incomes of families on lower incomes.”

Challenger banks seek tax review 

A group of challenger banks have written to the Competition and Markets Authority to push the Treasury to review the corporation tax surcharge on banks which came into force in January. The group of smaller lenders argues that the new tax hurts their ability to retain profits as capital, thus undermining competition in the sector.

UK will lose out in deal with Scotland 

A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) claims the recent deal between the UK and Scottish governments is unfair to taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The IFS says a forecast £900m of devolved tax revenues from the UK, which could be "redistributed" to Scotland annually by 2021-22, should be stopped once taxes are devolved. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is set to publish her taxation plans today. She is expected to state that top earners in Scotland will face higher taxes than those in other parts of the UK.

Sugar U-turn called for 

The Daily Telegraph’s Brendan O’Neill urges the Chancellor to perform a U-turn on his “ludicrous sugar tax”. He warns that the tax represents more than a petty sting on those who like soft drinks, arguing that it’s about “the unstoppable overreach of the political sphere, the invasion of our homes and bellies by politicians, docs and celebs who think they know better than us how we should live our lives”.

Results of review of transfers from DB to DC schemes  

The Financial Reporting Council has published the results of the Joint Forum on Actuarial Regulation’s (JFAR) review of transfers from Defined Benefit (DB) to Defined Contribution schemes. The review was undertaken to help JFAR understand the impact on actuarial work of pensions freedoms introduced in April 2015 and any consequent impact on actuarial regulation. The review found that since these pension freedoms were introduced there has been an increase in DB transfer quote requests and a small increase in actual transfers, but overall the numbers remain low. The report suggests that the rate of transfers may have been lower than expected thanks partly to a lack of understanding about what different products had to offer, a lack of advice available and trustees not actively promoting transfers to scheme members.

Millionaires call for higher taxes

A group of over 40 millionaires in New York state have signed a letter to the City’s Governor and other top lawmakers, calling on them to consider raising taxes on the state's wealthiest residents to help address poverty and rebuild failing infrastructure. Saying they were “deeply concerned that too many New Yorkers are struggling economically, and the state’s ailing infrastructure is in desperate need of attention”, the millionaires urged “the governor and the legislature” to pass “the 1% Plan for New York Tax Fairness”.

UK current account deficit has partial defence, says BoE's Forbes

Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes has said Britain's current account deficit is less vulnerable to a sudden stop in investor funding than its size suggests, but still carries risks. In a speech to the OMFIF finance industry group in London, Ms Forbes said that Britain's cross-border investments would offer some respite against a jump in uncertainty that could occur in the run-up to the EU referendum on June 23, but the relief would only be partial: "The estimated magnitude of this potential risk sharing through international exposures is moderate and would be unlikely to fully counteract the many negative effects from increased uncertainty on the broader UK economy. This is especially true over longer periods of time," she added.

Brexit views 

A vote to leave the EU in June could see some of Britain’s biggest companies facing a credit downgrade, ratings agency Moody’s claims. However, banking and insurance are less affected than non-financial companies, the agency added. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs has warned that banks, builders, property firms and home improvement businesses would be the worst hit UK companies if Britain voted to leave the EU while global businesses and those with strong international sales would be left relatively unscathed. Separately, the FT looks in detail at the CBI/PwC report into Brexit, along with those from Oxford Economics and CEP, and John Redwood outlines a Brexit Budget in the Telegraph. He states: “If we take back control, we will be better off, and be able to have a debate about who to tax and what to spend it on.”
