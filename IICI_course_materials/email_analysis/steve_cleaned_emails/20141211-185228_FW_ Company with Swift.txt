Dear Yana

 

I have found a simpler and not so expensive solution for you 

 

You can apply as a Small EMI (ELECTRONIC MONEY INSTITUTION). The application time if submitted fully complete is 3 months.

 

The is a minimal capital requirement when applying as a small EMI however the exact amount cannot be given until we understand more about the planned transactions. I would not envisage it being higher than 350,000 EURO as at that level you would be considering applying as a full EMI.

 

To apply we will need 

 

 

There is no initial capital requirement for small EMIs whose business activities generate (or are projected to generate) average outstanding e-money of less than €500,000. If this figure is exceeded the Own Funds requirement is calculated as 2% of ‘average outstanding electronic money at the end of each calendar day over the preceding 6 months’

*	details of the electronic money business you will conduct
*	details of any payment services business you will conduct
*	the governance arrangements and internal procedures in place

These should be outlined in the Business Plan.

In addition for the application we will need the following

*	how you will meet the capital requirements, if any (can be mix of cash and movable assets)
*	details of the individuals responsible for the management of the electronic money and/or payment services business (if applicable)
*	a description of how you will safeguard electronic money holders’ funds (see MLR below)

 

Before you can apply for the authorisation you must be registered under the Money Laundered Regulations. The process is quite straightforward and we will assist in this. The process requires a permanent address to be held where the MLR documents and compliance docs are stored and can be inspected. We can provide this complete service for you. 

 

It includes

 

·        Mail Address

·        Generate all required documents for the MLR certificate

·        Store them ready for inspection at our address in Harley Street. 

 

After this we can apply to FCA for the SEMI authorisation. Each director of the company and anyone who is active in managing clients will need to have a PSD form submitted in the application. None may have any negative background such as bankruptcy or financial crimes. (basically be of good character)

 

Our total fees to manage the process, raise all paperwork and process the EMI authorization including the required business plan and PSD forms will be £30,000. We will also need you to commit to allow legal costs of up to £7,500 extra available should we need then during the process but we feel it is unlikely we will need this.

 

£5000 is FCA fee, and min capital as mentioned above but the business plan will need show a cash buffers of at least 10% at any one time of total monthly turnover.

 

Please let me know if interested

 

Best regards
