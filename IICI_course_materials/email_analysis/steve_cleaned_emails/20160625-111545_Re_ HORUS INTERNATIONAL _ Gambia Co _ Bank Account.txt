Dear
Yuichiro
In response to
            your following query, our bank account processing team said:
‘We
            have submitted everything to the bank already he can ignore
            this email for the
            time being.’
One
            more update that you cannot receive and send money in USD
            through Euro Pacific Bank,
            make sure to invoice your clients and receive and send money
            in EURO or GBP.
Regards
Steve
