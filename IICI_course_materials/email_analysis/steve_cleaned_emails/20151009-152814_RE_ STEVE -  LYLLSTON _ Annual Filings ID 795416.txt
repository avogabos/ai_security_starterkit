Hi Steve,

 

We were to pay the Account Center for our Annual Accounts and Tax Returns
for the period of March 2014 to Feb 2015 to be filed before 30th nov. 2015
as you mentioned to do through your website using our online account.

We cannot do any bank transfer as we do not have Transaction number.

Could give us a transaction number and confirm your account number, so will
do it immediately.

 

On another hand  also confirm the mail to which send the Template for
transaction details.

Thanks and regards.

 

Eric
