Dear Tim


 


 


As I sent you documents of companies in my last email, which
means companies have been formed.


 


 


It is the now only Certificate of Good Standing, Apostille and
Power of Attorney.


 


 


We have ordered Certificate of Good standing with company
registrar, waiting to receive those, so that we can process Apostille.


 


 


For Power of Attorney I have asked many times for you to provide
me the name of the person on who’s name you wish to have Power of Attorney for
all 3 companies. I have not received the name till today.


 


 


Please note without the name I will not be able to process Power
of Attorney.


 


 


Regards


 


Steve
