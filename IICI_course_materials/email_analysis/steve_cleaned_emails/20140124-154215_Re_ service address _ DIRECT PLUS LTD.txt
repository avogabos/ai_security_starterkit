Hi
Attach is
the screen shot from Companies House website showing company director current
details.
If you wish
to change the director’s address, you can file Change Director/Secretary
Details application via Online Company Administrator.
And when
you are using our registered address, first correspondence from Companies House
is sent on registered address and if there is no response then they send
reminder to director address.
Any mails
from Companies House and HMRC received at our address are sent to you as scan
by email.
Your authorize
email address with us is
lorrainewhiskin@gmail.com
You can
change email address by using the UPDATE PROFILE option in your account.
Regards
Steve
