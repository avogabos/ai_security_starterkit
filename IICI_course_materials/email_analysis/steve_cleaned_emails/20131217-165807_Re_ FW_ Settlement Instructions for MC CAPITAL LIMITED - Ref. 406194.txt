Re: Settlement Instructions for MC CAPITAL LIMITED - Ref.

Hi Steve
Thanks for this information.
I have some questions.
1. What email address do they have for the customer details
for this bank account.
2. I see the details of how to deposit money, but what about
getting on-line access to the account, how do we do this.
3. I presume all this information is mailed to us, what
address will this go to.
4. When we contact the bank, I presume it should be from the
email address from question 1 and not my email address, is this correct.
5. We also don't have any detail about withdrawing money,
what is this procedure.
If we need to contact the bank directly about these
questions then please just provide the answer to question 1 and we will do the
rest.
Many thanks
Chris
