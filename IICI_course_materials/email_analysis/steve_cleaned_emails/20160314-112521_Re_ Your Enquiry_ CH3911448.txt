Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website.

Annual Return(s) (form(s) AR01) for 19 February 2015. This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40 and can also be downloaded from our website.

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64.

You should also be aware that an annual return for 19 February 2016 is due by 18 March 2016.  If this company is not restored to the register by the due date, then this document, along with a filing fee of £40 will also be required in order for the company to be restored.
