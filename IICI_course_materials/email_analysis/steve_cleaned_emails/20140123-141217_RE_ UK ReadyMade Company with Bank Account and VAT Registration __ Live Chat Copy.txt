Hi

 

As soon as company is transferred to you, online VAT form will
be available in your account. When you will fill and finalize the form, then we
will start the VAT Registration process.

 

No interview is required for VAT Registration.

 

You only need to fill the VAT application and we will process. During
the process VAT office might ask for some additional info, which will be
directed to you and assist you in answering those queries.

 

VAT Registration standard processing time is 4-6 weeks.

 

Question will be regarding business activity, annual turnover,
trading jurisdictions etc.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve

Hi,



 





When would
you apply vat for my company straight away when I purchase a company from you?





Also would
I be required to attend an interview with tax authorities in order to obtain a
vat number or will you handle all of that?





After I
fill in the VAT form is that all I need to do and nothing more and will I
obtain the vat number within 4-6 weeks also what kind of questions would I have
to answer in the vat application?





 





Thank you
