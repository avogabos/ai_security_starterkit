Dear Mr. Dayan,

Our legal team has checked Your application and it has two comments:

1) Please clarify, what are the specific products indicated in the bank forms? "We also supply to the wholesale market selling specific products via product specific websites just for other businesses"?
2) Because the application was signed a long time ago, the forms became outdated. Please let me know if it is possible for You to meet the bank representative again to resign the bank forms.

Looking forward to Your comments!

Dear Mr. Rafalsons,
 
The product will be sold on new websites, eventually in EU countries where we do not have resident company, like Spain Hungaria Czech Republic,  and/or in countries outside EU countries, like India Brazil or Turkey.
 
These new websites will be on line once we get our bank account which enable us to conclude a contract with payment platform.
 
Kind regards

Dear Mr Dayan,

Thank You for Your email. Your overall business is clear, but it is still unclear to me how the company will be used. Will it acquire products from the suppliers and distribute it to Your Germany, Polish and Italian companies, or will it work as a retailer by selling the products directly to customers through websites? Please describe in detail the incoming and outgoing payments. Also, as business partners You specified  <http://www.herbatech.fr/> www.herbatech.fr, promergy.com, phytoleader.com - what is the role of these companies? Are they suppliers or customers?

Dear Charlotte,

Thank You for the client! The applications looks good, although I was not able to ckeck everything since I do not have the corporate documents and ID documents of the client.
Just one remark regarding the business description - idealy, the client preprares the business description. So it needs to be written from the first person, and not third. Instead of writing that "software is made by the director Mr Santani", please write something like "The software is made by me" or "by us".
