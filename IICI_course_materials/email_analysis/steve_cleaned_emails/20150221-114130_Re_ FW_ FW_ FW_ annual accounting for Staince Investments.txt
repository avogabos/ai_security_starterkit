Hi Steve,

There is only a week left to send our accounting report to Companies 
House and I still see our accounts due at their Web Check. Please check 
with accounting service that they are going to send our accounts in 
time, I am worried.

Thank you for help,
Alex

Hi
                Alex
Yes
it
                is correct you need to select Annual Accountancy Service
                \u2013 GBP 300. You can
                pay by corporate card. Please note in order to pay by
                credit or debit card you
                need to have a 3D Secure code to authenticate the
                payment. Please collect this
                information from your card service provider.
Nominee
Director
                service is only available at the time of company
                formation and also
                nominee director will not involve in any company and
                will not provide any
                documents.

Re: FW: annual accounting for
                    Staince Investments
Hi Steve,
We have paid for our address but for accounting service
                we have the only option
                named Annual Accountancy Service, not Value Accounting.
                Is that correct option?
                And I have another question - can we pay with our
                corporate debit card
                (Maestro)?
There is one more problem appeared lately. We have been
                requested to present a
                director resided in EU to be able to process credit
                cards for our services. We
                need to provide a proof of residence for a person who is
                listed as a director.
                So I would like to know do you provide nominee director
                services and how much
                does it cost, considering that nominee director will not
                be bothered at all
                besides requesting a proof of residence time to time.
Thanks in advance for answers.
Best regards,
Alex

Steve,
I understand about the prices (we're not overdue yet
                  but close to that) but I
                  asked about our account ID :) We have several accounts
                  in your service and I am
                  not sure which account we should use for ordering. I
                  know about account IDs
                  4134665, 30138628 and there are probably more. Which
                  one of these is our proper
                  account?
Thank you for help,
Alex

To
                    process company\u2019s Annual Accounts and Tax Returns
                    you need
                    Value Accounting service for GBP 300. However if
                    filing is overdue then you
                    need to choose Extreme Accounting GBP 500.
If
                    you also need assistance with filing VAT Returns
                    then you
                    will need Value Accounting GBP 300 and OutSource
                    Accounts Department GBP 300.

Re: FW: annual accounting for

Hi Steve,
Thank you very much for the reply. I am not sure
                    about our account as we have 3
                    or 4 accounts with you - we got new one every time
                    of annual accounting for
                    several years. So I am not sure which one is correct
                    for now. Could you please
                    tell me which account should we use for ordering? We
                    will try to order Value
                    Accounting and registered address renewal, I will
                    ask for help if we get issues
                    with it.
Thank you for care,
Alex

Hi Oliver,
We have just chat with you. Our company is Staince Investments, Ltd. and
we'd like to use your service for annual accounting again. I need a bit
of help with a payment for your services (we used your service several
times and every time there is something new :)) and a template for an
accounting data - we usually send out our transactions list using your
templates and the rest is done by your company, including reports to
Companies House. I would be happy if we could do the same this time.
Thank you for care,
Alex
