Hi Steve,

I Hope you are doing well.

Can you please check company i indicated above and tell me  this 2 things:

Option 1- if we renew this company for 2015

the complete amount of the renewal is 215 GBP ? as previous year ? what is
the last date of renewal ? can we do that January 2015 or we should close
that Dec 2014?

Option 2

If owner of this company will decide to do not renew but just to finish
this company, what is the procedure then ? do they need to pay for the
company closing and how much?

Kind Regards,

Maria Kin
