    USD Wiring Notice      
    Please note for our USD wiring instructions we are currently utilizing two payment processors for clearing all wires: Global Transaction Services (GTS) for all wires and Global Currency Exchange (GCEN) for only first-party wires.   
 These are payment processors who process the incoming payments before they are credited to Euro Pacific Bank, and as such have unique instructions different than our standard intermediary bank format.   
 Please acknowledge the below points as they are crucial to the successful operation of all accounts at Euro Pacific Bank.      
    Beneficiary      
         
     
With our USD wiring instructions, the client’s account will not be the Beneficiary Customer on the wire. We strongly recommend that each client check with their sending bank before the account is activated, and if the sending bank mandates that the client be the beneficiary on the wire please contact us for alternative solutions.      
    Reference      
         
     
Our wiring instructions for USD require a “Reference Field” to identify the client as the account holder. If there is no reference field on the client’s outgoing wire forms, there will be no way to distinguish the client as account holder once the wire is received at the bank which may lead to a high likelihood of misdirected wires.      
    See our USD instructions on the last page of link below, which can be brought to the sending bank to ensure compatibility with their wiring guidelines.
