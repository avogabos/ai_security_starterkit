Dear Steve, 

 

I am Mr. Ruiz-Luque, Mr. Juan Luques's lawyer.

 

I am writing with regard to your last email. I will try to clarify the
situation:

 

Firstly, we mentioned address as 'AV. Bulevar Príncipe Alfonso
Hohenlohe...'. It is the new workplace address for Mr. Juan Luques, but he
has not got any document for it.

 

Second, therefore, we would change the Residencial address, so we send you
the Mr. Juan Luques's Residential address since 2013. Here, he is the lesee,
so the documents is with the landlord named, Mrs Leila Akhoundova.

 

In relation with the electricity bill, the address 'Apartado De Correos
61...' It is the post office box, but in the lower middlepart of the
electricy bill is the delivery address: 'Lugar del Quinto,132, Alhaurín el
Grande, Málaga ('Lugar' is the same that 'Camino' in this meaning). I attach
a copy and I show you now in red.

 

Finally, previously to 2013, Mr. Juan Luques was living in the address 'C.
Tomas Martín SN', but it is an old adress. In 2016 he must renewed ID.

 

I am very sorry for the inconvenience. It has been a chain of
misunderstandings.

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Respectfully.

 

Hernán Ruiz-Luque.

Lawyer in Málaga nº 8665.
