Hi Steve

Thanks for your email.

What due diligence documentation would you require if the shares in the company were being transferred to one of our own companies who would hold the shares as Nominee for our client?

Secondly, are you able to offer a trade discount on the price quoted, so that we can add a margin to cover our costs?

I wait to hear from you

Regards
