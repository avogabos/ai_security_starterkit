Subject: Re: UK Co : RPA ELECTRICAL SERVICES : Orderno. 194420 : Urgent
 Response Required.
From: Rob Allen <rpaelectricalservices@gmail.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Thank you for calling me this afternoon.   Your response is appreciated.

However as I pointed out to the gentleman who called:

a)  Your website advises that you are able to complete the *whole* process
in eight hours.  How is this possible if after eight hours you request
further documentation to complete Due Diligence requirements.  No mention
is made of this at the outset.  It was imperative that this new company be
formed as quickly as possible.  If we had been made aware of this
requirement at the start of the process we would have been aware that we
would not be able to do this within eight hours as one of the Directors
works on a building site!!
b)  Your payment request made no mention of an additional amount for VAT.
Your representative who called this afternoon acknowledged that no mention
is made of a further VAT amount to be charged on your website and also
advised that your technicians are currently working on the website to
correct this fault.  I am, of course, aware that above a certain annual
turnover you are obliged to charge VAT.  However, I had assumed that this
was included in the fee you were charging.

I logged on to your website on Thursday, 12th October 2017.  I paid £95.00
for the Instant Trading Solution UK and a further £25 for the Express
Formation.

Please would you refund the £120.00 to my Barclaycard number 4929 1085 1177
8004, Expiry date 08/19.  Please would you also confirm to me by email that
this has been done without delay.

I will, of course, be forwarding a copy of this email chain to Companies
House for their reference.

I look forward to hearing back from you by return.

As you have not been able on this occasion to provide the service promised, please refund the amount I have already paid.
