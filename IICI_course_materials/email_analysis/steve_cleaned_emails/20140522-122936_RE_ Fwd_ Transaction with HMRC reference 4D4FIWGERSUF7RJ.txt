Hi Steve

 

Is there any news on the VAT Registration no. 

 

We have a client to bill this month that was delayed from last month, so
this is getting urgent.

 

Many thanks

Chris

Hi

 

No the Vat number is not issued yet, it will take couple weeks before HMRC
will contact you directly with VAT certificate and registration number.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve
