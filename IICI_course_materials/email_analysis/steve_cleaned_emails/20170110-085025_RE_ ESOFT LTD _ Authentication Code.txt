Dear Steve,

Thank you for sending the information, but I'm still not able to login. I
tried to enter the given Gateway ID and password to:

https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services

or 

https://authenticate.gateway.gov.uk/sidp/SignIn.ashx?gwv=1.0

p%3a%2f%2fwww.gateway.gov.uk%2fDefault.aspx&gwcategory=Org

 


and I have got a message saying invalid user id or password.

 

Another question please: after I have logged into the companies house
website, I got 5 links to proceed with, which are:

Abbreviated accounts

Dormant company Accounts

Micro-entity Accounts

Full Accounts (with abbreviated option)

File company tax returns and accounts

 

which of these options I should use? It is possible to use the last option
to use the joint filing account service?

 

Thank you 

Regards,

Rana Risheh
