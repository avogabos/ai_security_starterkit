Dear Mr Lehwald.

 

We apologise for the delay in answering your concern, we wanted to recheck
the current status of The Gambia.

The government has a lot of unrest at the moment and there have been
multiple changes in the ministry positions. They have withdrawn the notices
as the were placed by a new minister who wanted the evidence of the signed
Presidential Decree approving the implementation of the Commerce Registry in
Gambia and the Commerce Zone near Banjul Airport.

 

ICommerce Registry website has been taken from public access, and access is
limited for forming new IBC's. We have left the product on our website as it
enables potential customers to contact and us and discuss an alternative
option unless they wish to go ahead with the IBC as according the to
contract between Commerce Registry and The government of Gambia is still
valid and has not been formerly revoked.

 

Formations House however is currently working with several new jurisdictions
to offer another option in the same vein as The Gambia but in a country with
much less instability.

 

If you wish to renew, you may. We can offer in the future once the new
jurisdiction are available, the option to relocate the company, same name
and if possible the same company number. We would look to do this at minimal
cost.

 

I hope this email has helped clarify the position, but please do feel free
to ask any further questions

Hi Steve,

 

In 2015 I set up an offshore IBC in The Gambia using the services of
Formationshouse. The renewal was due in Nov. 2016, which I missed. After
looking into it, as I intended to still renew, I came across some
information, that the Gambia IBC is a scam and was not supported by their
Government. I can also not access the iCommerce Support website. On your
Formationshouse website you still offer this Gambia IBC, which conflicts
with all other info about it. Could you please update me on this issue.

 

Thank you,

Ralf
