Majid,

My name is Vincent Le and am the banker in charge of your application with Euro Pacific Bank.


I attempted to reach you by phone today to introduce myself and confirm my understanding of your business and its intended transactions with our bank.


Can we schedule a short phone or Skype call this week? I'm available all Dubai hours.


Regards,
