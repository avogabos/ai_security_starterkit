IFS questions tax attack on Labour…
The IFS has undermined David Cameron’s claim that working families face an average £3,000 tax rise if Labour is elected, describing the figure as “unhelpful and of little value”. The think tank said that Labour could theoretically meet its fiscal targets with as little as £3bn in tax rises from 2018-19, as opposed to the £15bn in tax rises from 2017-18 onwards that the Conservative numbers assumed. However, Paul Johnson of the IFS also writes in the Times that both Labour and the Tories need to offer more detailed information on their tax plans before a conclusion can be drawn. Meanwhile, John McDonnell, the Labour MP and leader of the Socialist Campaign Group has warned Ed Miliband that a group of “30 to 40 left MPs” are preparing to oppose any attempt by the party to make cuts. Separately, David Cameron and George Osborne are expected to today announce that 2m jobs would be created under a Conservative government through freezing working-age benefits, raising the tax threshold and creating more apprenticeships.

… but business urges party to reconsider policies
Business leaders have told Ed Miliband to reconsider Labour's regulatory and tax plans and urged him to make a stronger case for EU reforms. After the Labour leader launched the party’s business manifesto, director general of the BCC John Longworth voiced fears that a Miliband government might raise corporation tax as the price for cuts in business rates. The IoD backed the party’s plan to improve transparency on executive pay, but attacked the proposed freeze on energy prices and plan to add 1p to corporation tax.

Moulton hits back over City Link report
Better Capital founder Jon Moulton has criticised MPs who grilled him over the collapse of City Link, claiming they failed to give him a fair hearing. Mr Moulton was responding to a highly critical joint report from the Commons Scottish affairs and the business, innovation and skills committees. The report claimed that Better Capital and City Link had financially benefited from workers at the courier firm being “deliberately deceived by omission” about its true financial state as it approached collapse last Christmas.

SMEs dubious about digital
According to a survey by the Bank of Scotland, a digital "blind-spot" remains for a significant number of SMES that do not understand the benefits of new technology such as online banking tools. Just over a quarter (27%) of all Scottish organisations surveyed believe digital is "irrelevant" to them, according to the UK Business Digital Index compiled by the bank. Separately, Philip Augar, a non-executive director at TSB, writes in the FT on why he believes the switch to mobile and online banking has the potential to free customers from “broken banks”.
