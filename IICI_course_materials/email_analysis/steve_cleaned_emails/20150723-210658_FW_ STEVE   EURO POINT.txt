Regarding  EURO PRINT----
 
Hi Steve:
 
In this situation to have the company EURO PRINT, LTD that has
been bought from you is very complecated.
 
The problem is that the company urgently need to get the Corp.
account opened and effective promptly.
In the information that we have got from you  - and we understand
 this is what Barclays Bank has informed you about - it can take 
between 4 > 8 weeks to have this done.
 
When Mr Madsen talked to his bankofficer in housebank - and the
representative from Barclays Bank where the huge amount  is
comming from,- they said:  they have to transfere the funds into
this new company= EURO PRINT, LTD- account, - and can NOT
wait that long period of time.
 
Can you offer to sell a UK- company,( registred in London) that has
a bankaccount in Barclays Bank, London- otherweiss if Barclays
Bank, London have a department where they have companies
allready completed,- with the bankaccount in Barclays Bank, Main-
branch, London ??
 
Please advise what we can do--( and send that email to Mr Jorgen
Madsen + cc to Ulf Rudén)
 
Truly Yours,
 
 
Jorgen Madsen, Dir.
