Hi Steve

We are trying to finalise the registration of an office but they need a
couple of documents that I do not have.

1. The original Certificate of Incorporation so they can take a copy. Can
you tell me where this is?
2. Proof of a UK Bank Account. Apparently this is a new requirement this
year by the City Of London. I think Raj is waiting on another letter from
the Seychelles, before the account can be set up. Can you please look into
this ASAP

Many thanks
Chris
