Do you need a Company Secretary for an Irish registered company?
Dear Steve,
Have 
                              you ever had the experience of leaving to go to 
                              a meeting where important documents need to be executed 
                              under seal and somebody says "So who has the 
                              company seal....?"
And when you go looking the seal can not be found.
Well, help is at hand in the form of
CFI's
unique online system for ordering company seals.
Simply
click 
                              here
and without leaving your desk you 
                              can:
Call up the exact format of 
                                  the company name in question
(
as registered in the CRO
) so there is 
                                  no confusion between things like “and” 
                                  versus “&” or full stops etc.
See the company number
AND
its Registered Office address to confirm this 
                                  is the correct company.
Decide between a Pliers Type 
                                  or a Desk Type Seal.
Order the Company Seal and 
                                  charge it to your account
(
or give credit card details
)
We 
                              will then immediately arrange for the manufacture 
                              of the company seal and despatch it to you, by the 
                              method of your choice.
What could be easier?
And if you need a Company Register replaced or 
                              reconstituted, we can do that as well. Simply call 
                              us today for our factsheet on Combined Company Registers.
Yours 
                              sincerely,
