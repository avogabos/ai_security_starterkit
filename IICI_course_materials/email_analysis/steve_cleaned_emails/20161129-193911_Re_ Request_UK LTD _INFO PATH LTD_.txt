Dear Steve,

Thank you for confirmation and reservation.

We will pay online from MasterCard (or Visa) by the second method you
suggested.  We have already collected  passport of the director and the
shareholder. We are ready to pay. So, how we shall proceed further? As far
as I understand we could pay the balance between GBP 265 and the final
amount by mean of MasterCard (or Visa) as well. Kindly correct me if I
wrong.

Please see below our comments to your e-mail in blue

Could you please proceed our order as soon as possible, it  is so urgent
for our client.

Thank you in advance.

With best regards,
Ekaterina
