Hi Steve (or Talal?).

Ok, I do hope this is "one last time"... at least until the end of this
year. :-)

Dear
Steve,
which
bank account do you prefer: Swiss Euro, German or British (because of the
banking fees)?
By
the way, one regular letter was sent on 22.10.13 from Germany to South Africa
by normal priority mail.
Please
let the customer know and kindly ask him to tell you (and us) if it arrived
fine (when he gets it).

Re: Postal Address Change (Sovereign International Group Ltd)
Hi
Steve,
Courier
shipments are paid for separately and prior to forwarding.
The
cheapest but still reliable option would be TNT (it is part of the Swiss Post).
The shipment cost will be 90 CHF (ca. 73 Euros as of today).
Other
couriers like DHL, UPS or FedEx will be much more expensive.

Hi

You
