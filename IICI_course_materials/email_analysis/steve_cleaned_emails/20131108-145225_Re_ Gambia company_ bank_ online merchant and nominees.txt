Hello oliver,
Please give me sometime to run this by my partner and revert to you. In the
meantime we know the US and EU are heavily pushing for non-secrecy on their
banks:

http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-27/switzerland-struggles-with-bank-secrecy-amid-u-dot-s-dot-pursuit-of-tax-evaders

So we'll like to keep our affairs strictly African.

I shall discuss with our Directors and revert to you
