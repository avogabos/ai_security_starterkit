Dear Steve,

I have done it so let me know when I can have my parcel and what ever else there is for me there.

I have also paid 50GBP for the annual hosting of the website kindly send me an invoice. I will have a problem with the graphics designer part since I am not sure how to go about that any advise will be highly appreciated….

Thank you very much for everything once again.

Kind regards,

Maria

Re: Vo Mail Client : Package Tracking Enquiry : MB CAPITAL VENTURES
Dear Steve,
Thank you very much for your prompt response.
As I am not aware of that procedure kindly tell me how do I do this as I might miss important mail this way!
I also need to know if you have received another result envelope from De Grisogono for me as they told me they sent it a month ago and no one has notified me of that. I guess back then my 'wallet" had sufficient funds but no one forwarded the envelope which I gather has been lost by now!
Kindly tell me how to pay so that I can receive my package at home.
best regards

Dear Steve,
Happy new year!
I am attaching something that was sent to our office address at Harley street it has been signed for and it was never forwarded to me as well as an envelope from De Grisogono jewelry one month ago.
Please be kind enough to tell me who received my items and why have I not been notified? I thought that everything received would be forwarded to me at home in Faringdon. I am paying for his service right???
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Maria
