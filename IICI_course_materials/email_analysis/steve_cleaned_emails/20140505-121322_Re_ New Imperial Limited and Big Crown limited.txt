Dear Steve,

Thank you very much for your email.

Could you please indicate what would be 'the additional cost' for a UK 
company provided that our clients has only received certificates of 
incorporation, M&As and shares certificates (all documents in electronic 
format). Therefore, they received services only for USD310. Other 
services/documents had been paid according to the attached invoices but 
were not received in fact.

Is it possible to buy this company as shelf ones provided that our 
clients will provide names of shareholders and directors later?

Best regards,
Andrei
