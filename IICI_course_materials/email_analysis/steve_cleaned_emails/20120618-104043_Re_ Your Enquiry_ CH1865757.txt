Dear Mr Smith

Re: TRIXY U.K LTD    No.7373471

Thank you for your email.

I can confirm that the company will not receive a late filing penalty
as the account became due after the company was dissolved.

To make a complete administrative restoration application the directors
will need to file the following documents and fees:

1) Form RT01 together with the £100.00 filing fee.

2) The annual returns for 13 September 2011, with the filing fee of
£40.00.

3) Accounts for the period ending 30 September 2011.

4) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered
online at
http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/bvc14-administrative-restoration.aspx.

I hope that this information is of use to you but if you need any
further help, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully

Andrew Lear
