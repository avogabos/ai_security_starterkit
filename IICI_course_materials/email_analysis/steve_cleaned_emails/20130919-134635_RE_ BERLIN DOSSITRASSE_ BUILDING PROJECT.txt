Dear Rohail, 

 

Further to our recent numerous phone conversations and e-mails, I have now spoken with my CEO, Karim Rajani in Vancouver, and we are aiming to organise a tele conference to discuss the project and potential suitable terms on Tuesday coming. in our conversation, you indicated that you will require your Solicitors present, Clyde & Co. Please would you kindly confirm a suitable time for the tele conference so we can move forward in this matter. For the avoidance of any doubt, we are very keen to discuss this with you and your solicitors, and should we be in agreement in respect of terms, I shall ensure that a term Sheet is generated with the utmost expediency. 

 

Yours sincerely

Dear Rohail, 
 
I have now recieved the joint presentation, and have forwarded it to Vancouver with my reccomendations. I have since spoken with Karim and we will revert back to you after the 22nd July 2013 in order to progress matters forward. As you are aware, if we are able to assist you, the first step will be to issue a Conditional Term Sheet. After this has been issued, we will have to agree the relevant amount of due diligence fees that will be payable by you. 
 
I will report back in accord with the above timescales.
 
Best Wishes 
 
Yours sincerely
