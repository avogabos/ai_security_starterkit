Referendum debate has hit business investment
Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI, has warned that the Scottish referendum debate had delayed investment and damaged the image of British businesses abroad. Steve Varley, UK chairman of EY, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, agreed that recent figures show that Scotland’s share of foreign direct investment projects in the UK fell slightly last year. He added that international investors already committed to Scotland and the UK face an uncomfortable wait until policy certainty returns. He explains that there are three different party-political proposals for the Scottish people to respond to, with "varying flavours of control" over income tax, corporation tax and in the case of the Lib Dem proposal, the power for Scotland to be able to raise its own debt. On devolving corporation tax, John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said that it could "trigger a race to the bottom", while handing powers to set the minimum wage would also fragment the single market. Meanwhile, David Glen, head of tax in Scotland at PwC, warned of the impact of new taxes: “Don’t underestimate how much Scottish taxes are going to change regardless of the No vote. New rates of income tax and a completely different tax on land and property will have most impact.” Elsewhere, Martin Gilbert, CEO of Aberdeen Asset Management, tells the Sunday Times that he would like to see Scotland with greater fiscal freedom so it could offer a range of grants and tax advantages to encourage start-ups and emerging businesses. Separately, a survey of businesses by the IoD shows that 67% would like tax and spending powers devolved to regions or cities in England. Simon Massey, tax partner at Menzies, warns that regions could end up competing for business and cutting each other's throats.

Labour pledge to cut business rates
The Labour Party is to commit to a cut in business rates worth more than £1bn. The Sunday Telegraph says that Labour will use its party conference to unveil a 1% cut in business rates in 2015 if it wins next year's election. The move would involve reversing the inflation-linked increases scheduled for April 2015 and 2016. According to an analysis by the House of Commons Library, this would be worth £250m to businesses in 2015 and £540m in 2016. Separately, a new report to be released in the next few weeks from the British Property Federation will say that 1m small firms should be exempted completely from business rates in an overhaul of the way companies are taxed by local councils. The federation will say that the overhaul would help all small property-based firms not just retailers. Elsewhere, it is reported that Ed Miliband is to promise to boost the minimum wage to over £8 an hour if his party gets into power, adding £60 a week to the UK’s lowest paid workers’ salary.

Call for tax to cover NHS funding gap
Leaders of the National Health Action Party have written to Ed Miliband warning him that he could become the Labour Prime Minister who lets the NHS descend into "total crisis", if he does not introduce "significant, immediate injections of extra funding" for the health service. The letter recommends the introduction of a temporary rise in income tax to fill the NHS's growing funding gap.
The Independent on Sunday, Page: 16-17

"Sin taxes" criticised
A new report from the Institute of Economics suggests that so-called "sin taxes" raise far more than the cost of harm the "sins" cause. Alcohol tax raises £12bn a year, double what alcohol problems cost the state, says the report. Driving levies, such as fuel duty and car tax, bring in more than £37bn, while spending on roads is £7.1bn. And tobacco duties come to £9.6bn which is four times the healthcare costs of smoking.

Cyber security work grows
According to the Management Consultancies Association (MCA), there is a boom in cyber and digital security with a quarter of all management consultancy in the UK now involving digital work, and firms are redeploying their consultants to meet the demand. The Sunday Times talks to Richard Krishnan who this year left KPMG’s global justice and security team to become a director in its cybersecurity practice. Mr Krishnan says he was able to take much of what he had learnt when dealing with physical security and apply it to digital security, although there was a steep learning curve. Paul Connolly, director of the MCA, predicts there will be more redeployments to help consultancy houses beef up their digital and cyber teams and he notes that PwC is placing large bets on cyber security and now has about 100 professionals specialising in this area in the UK, 80 of whom have been recruited since 2013.

Millions join company pension schemes
The Sunday Times reports that nearly 4.5m workers have joined company pension schemes under the government’s auto-enrolment initiative, which is approaching its second anniversary. Steve Webb, the pensions minister, said: “We are finally ending the trend of falling pension saving and millions of people are looking towards a more comfortable retirement. Almost everybody who has the chance to save would benefit in the long run from doing so.”

The struggling "squeezed upper middle"
According to a new book about the "squeezed upper middle", people earning between £160,000 and £370,000 a year are struggling to maintain their lifestyle and resent those earning even more, despite being in the top 1% of earners in the country.
