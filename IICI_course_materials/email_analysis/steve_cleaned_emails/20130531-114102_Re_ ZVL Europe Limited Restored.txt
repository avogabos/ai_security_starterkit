Dear David A. Levi Blum
I am very very sorry for the delay.
I have contacted Companies House to update us as why the company has not been restored. We are waiting for their reply.
Please allow me 2 working days and I will get back to you with an answer.
Thank you

Dear Steve,
would you, pls, URGENTLY explain what exactly happened and why the compynay ZVL Europe Ltd. is still NOT ready to operate ?
It is surprising that since October it was impossible to restore the dissolved company and we would like to know the reasons and what is the estimated time that we can operate our above company again...
Pls, inform by return mail and let ma know the status of the above.
Thanking you,
David A. Levi Blum
