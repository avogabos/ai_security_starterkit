Dear Steve,

Thank you very much!

I thought there was one thing missing…and ok I have paid online for the filing of the confirmation statement!
The SIC code is 70221 - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

I am the only person with significant power and sole shareholder therefore nothing to input there.
Can you take care of this? DO I have to go back and re-do something?

Please do send me an invoice for my records and the filing copy after it is done for my records as well.

Thanks a million and have a long and restful holiday!!
Merry Christmas!


Kind regards,

Maria

P.S. in case I do forget something in the meantime please do keep an eye of what needs to be updated and drop me an email when the time of expiration comes
