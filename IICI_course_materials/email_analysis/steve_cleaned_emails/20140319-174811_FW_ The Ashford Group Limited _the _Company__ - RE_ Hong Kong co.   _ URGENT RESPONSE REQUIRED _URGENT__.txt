Dear Sarah,

 

As your appointed corporate secretary, we have a statutory and professional duties of ensuring any filings and keeping of records of the Company that we are managing, are in accordance with the prevailing laws, rules and regulations governing the management of a HK company.

 

As we are dealing with you as reseller, we certainly looking forward to work with you closely in providing services in relation to the changes of details within the Company, and I am sorry that for the change of director, simply filing the Form D4 is not sufficient to reflect the changes as other documents need to be prepared as well.

 

I am sure you would appreciate that although HK Laws are based on the foundation of English Legal System being a former colony of UK until its handover in 1997, some changes since then has made the system of filing of a changes of HK companies greatly different than in the UK. 

 

To  further provide details to you in relation to other matters :-

 

(1) The statutory records of the Company has since been transferred to your designated virtual office location. We at the moment hold not originals of the statutory records

 

(2) For changes of directors, you may file the changes anytime without us doing anything if you wish. But please do be reminded that the changes have to be in accordance with the prevailing rules governing the operations of Hong Kong companies, failure which the Registry may impose civil and criminal penalties onto the directors, officers and managers.

 

(3) For changes of Company Secretary, you can either lodge the changes from your end, or we may prepare all documents on your behalf and quote you a fee accordingly. Please let us know if you need us to prepare.

 

As for the fee for changes of director, they are quoted based on the estimated time costs, and documents required to be prepared, which we have listed in the e-mail for your kind reference, and these fees are the discounted fee that we offered to you as reseller (we changed direct client a much higher regular fee). I am sorry that whether the filing costs are free or not will be reflected separately as disbursement. Being a professional service provider, the fees charged are based on the time costs of each person spent in an estimated project. I am sure your company, being in the similar profession would agree more with us than others.

 

Please let us know if you need further clarifications. Thank you.

Dear Sarah

 

I've just seen the most recent exchange below. Without going into the full details of this particular matter, if you want us to conduct administration on behalf of a company we will charge a reasonable fee for this service which will reflect the complexity (or not as the case may be) and the time taken. The filing cost, whether online or in hard copy form, is irrelevant as this would be billed as a disbursement in any event. We are very happy to be competitive on fees and we will of course provide you with an excellent service.

 

I'm sure that Alex will respond on the other matters.

 

Best regards

 

Daniel

Dear Alex,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note that we are resellers and provide these services such as appointment and termination of directors etc to our clients free of cost in jurisdictions where free online filings are available.

 

Our client needs to only file the D4 form which allows him to terminate the director. This resolution was for our records and will be amended accordingly. The director will be terminated on today's date.

 

The £500 fee that you are charging is not acceptable as this can be done online free of cost. Please let us know which ancillary documents you require? 

 

Also, as advised we would like you to transfer this company to our own account named HKFILEPOINT at the HK registry. 

 

We would like to also terminate Corporate Secretary. Please advise?

 

Please get back to us regarding the above as soon as possible.

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

Dear Sarah,

 

In reply to your question below :-

 

(1) We do not know what is the Administration Access and HKFILEPOINT you are referring to. The filing system of HK company is different from other jurisdictions.

 

(2) The changes of directors need to be lodged with the Companies Registry within 14 days. From the documents, it showed that the resignation of the director is to take effect from 1st February 2014 which therefore the Company has been late in filing, therefore penalties maybe imposed by Companies Registry.

 

(3) If you wish us to prepare all of the ancillary documents to lodged the change, and to update the Registers, our professional fees in this regard would be £500, which include :-

- Filing of the same with Companies Registry with immediate effect

- Preparation of Letter of Resignation to be signed by the resigned director

- Update the statutory records by sending to the Location where the records are kept, and update the Register of Directors accordingly

- Prepare a board resolutions in the correct format in accordance with Companies Ordinance to be signed by all of the directors

 

Please confirm on your acceptance to the above, so that we can issue you an invoice for payment. Once payment is duly received, we shall proceed to prepare all of the documents accordingly. Thank you.

 

Please note public holiday(s) in the below jurisdiction(s):-

Dear Sarah,

 

Given there is a change of the address, we will need to prepare another set of documents to file the change, and board resolutions. Thereafter then we will arrange for the delivery of the company kit. However, this should be completed within this week.

 

Do note that you are to ensure that the intended recipient is agreeable to receive the files, as in the previous cases which they told us they refused to accept simply they have not agreed to the service yet. Thank you.

Dear Sarah,

 

As you may aware, the company kit is now with us with the Executive Centre to take delivery of the kit, but we have since lodged with Registry to inform them that the address would be where the kit is kept. Please help to resolve this with them, and inform us when it is to deliver.

 

However, we noted given the urgency and in special arrangements, we have arranged for the following documents to be certified by HK professional lawyer :-

 

 

(1)    Certificate of Incorporation

 

(2)    Business Registration Certificate

 

(3)    Memorandum and Articles of Association

 

(4)    Registers of Members and Directors

 

The said documents had been couriered to Mr. Ashford’s address which you have given to us.

 

I will need to discuss with our UK office on how we would charge the certification that we have made onto the above documents. As a normal practice, we would not proceed with the certification without first agreement is made on the fees to be charged for such service.

 

We hope this can be avoided in future. We await for your confirmation on when we can proceed with delivery of the company kit. Thank you.

 

Please note office closures for holidays during Christmas and New Year in the below jurisdictions:-

 

•         Hong Kong:        24 & 31 December 2013  PM

Subject: RE: The Ashford Group Limited (the "Company") - RE: Hong Kong co. DUE DELIGENCE DOCS (both persons documents) **REMINDER**

 

 

Dear Sarah,

 

Based on your instructions and confirmation, we have arranged to lodged with the Registrar that the registers and minutes (including all of the originals of the statutory records) will be kept at Accounts Processing Centre, 1805 Wheelock House, 20 Pedder Street, Hong Kong.

 

We have confirmed early this week that the records are ready for delivery provided that you would inform us the person to whom we should attention the register for acknowledgment of receipt of the said records, which are considered legal documentations of the Company.

 

As a repeated reminder that such records COULD NOT BE KEPT OUTSIDE HONG KONG and there is no such fillings which would allow you to register the records as being kept outside Hong Kong. Although we have no control whatever the directors would do with the records after they took possession of the same. But as an officer and acting company secretary of the Company, we are unable to comply with the requests which we would know in contravening with the prevailing legal legislation governing the operations of a Hong Kong company.

 

You may consult Companies Ordinance ss. 74A(3), 88(3), 89(3),95(3), 119A(2) & 158A(2)) should you have any doubts.

 

Please therefore let us know who is the person to take possession of the record at the address in Hong Kong and the telephone number and we can deliver anytime !

 

Please note office closures for holidays during Christmas and New Year in the below jurisdictions:-

 

•         Hong Kong:        24 & 31 December 2013  PM

Sorry for the insistence. As the documents that we are going to send are statutory records(most of it in originals), we must have someone that we could attention to, and to acknowledge receipt of the said documents by the appointed person.

Therefore please give us the contact person and telephone number of the receiving party.

Dear Sarah,
As your appointed corporate secretary, we have a
statutory and professional duties of ensuring any filings and keeping of
records of the Company that we are managing, are in accordance with the
prevailing laws, rules and regulations governing the management of a HK
company.
As we are dealing with you as reseller, we certainly
looking forward to work with you closely in providing services in relation to
the changes of details within the Company, and I am sorry that for the change
of director, simply filing the Form D4 is not sufficient to reflect the changes
as other documents need to be prepared as well.
I am sure you would appreciate that although HK Laws are
based on the foundation of English Legal System being a former colony of UK
until its handover in 1997, some changes since then has made the system of
filing of a changes of HK companies greatly different than in the UK.
To  further provide details to you in relation to
other matters :-
(1) The statutory records of the Company has since been
transferred to your designated virtual office location. We at the moment hold
not originals of the statutory records
(2) For changes of directors, you may file the changes
anytime without us doing anything if you wish. But please do be reminded that
the changes have to be in accordance with the prevailing rules governing the
operations of Hong Kong companies, failure which the Registry may impose civil
and criminal penalties onto the directors, officers and managers.
(3) For changes of Company Secretary, you can either
lodge the changes from your end, or we may prepare all documents on your behalf
and quote you a fee accordingly. Please let us know if you need us to prepare.
As for the fee for changes of director, they are quoted
based on the estimated time costs, and documents required to be prepared, which
we have listed in the e-mail for your kind reference, and these fees are the
discounted fee that we offered to you as reseller (we changed direct client a
much higher regular fee). I am sorry that whether the filing costs are free or
not will be reflected separately as disbursement. Being a professional service
provider, the fees charged are based on the time costs of each person spent in
an estimated project. I am sure your company, being in the similar profession
would agree more with us than others.
Please let us know if you need further clarifications.
Thank you.

Dear Sarah
I've just seen the most recent exchange below. Without
going into the full details of this particular matter, if you want us to
conduct administration on behalf of a company we will charge a reasonable fee
for this service which will reflect the complexity (or not as the case may be)
and the time taken. The filing cost, whether online or in hard copy form, is
irrelevant as this would be billed as a disbursement in any event. We are very
happy to be competitive on fees and we will of course provide you with an excellent
service.
I'm sure that Alex will respond on the other matters.
Best regards
Daniel

Dear Alex,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that we are resellers and provide these
services such as appointment and termination of directors etc to our clients
free of cost in jurisdictions where free online filings are available.
Our client needs to only file the D4 form which allows him
to terminate the director. This resolution was for our records and will be
amended accordingly. The director will be terminated on today's date.
The £500 fee that you are charging is not acceptable as
this can be done online free of cost. Please let us know which ancillary
documents you require?
Also, as advised we would like you to transfer this
company to our own account named HKFILEPOINT at the HK registry.
We would like to also terminate Corporate Secretary.
Please advise?
Please get back to us regarding the above as soon as
possible.
Looking forward to hear from you.
Best Regards,
Sarah

Dear Sarah,
In reply to your question below :-
(1) We do not know what is the Administration Access and
HKFILEPOINT you are referring to. The filing system of HK company is different
from other jurisdictions.
(2) The changes of directors need to be lodged with the
Companies Registry within 14 days. From the documents, it showed that the
resignation of the director is to take effect from 1st February 2014 which
therefore the Company has been late in filing, therefore penalties maybe
imposed by Companies Registry.
(3) If you wish us to prepare all of the ancillary
documents to lodged the change, and to update the Registers, our professional
fees in this regard would be £500, which include :-
- Filing of the same with Companies Registry with
immediate effect
- Preparation of Letter of Resignation to be signed by
the resigned director
- Update the statutory records by sending to the Location
where the records are kept, and update the Register of Directors accordingly
- Prepare a board resolutions in the correct format in
accordance with Companies Ordinance to be signed by all of the directors
Please confirm on your acceptance to the above, so that
we can issue you an invoice for payment. Once payment is duly received, we
shall proceed to prepare all of the documents accordingly. Thank you.
Please note public holiday(s) in the below
jurisdiction(s):-
•
Taiwan:           Friday, 28
February 2014 Peace Memorial Day
Respective offices and governments will resume business
on the next working day.

Dear Sarah,
Given there is a change of the address, we will need to
prepare another set of documents to file the change, and board resolutions.
Thereafter then we will arrange for the delivery of the company kit. However,
this should be completed within this week.
Do note that you are to ensure that the intended
recipient is agreeable to receive the files, as in the previous cases which
they told us they refused to accept simply they have not agreed to the service

Dear Sarah,
As you may aware, the company kit is now with us with the
Executive Centre to take delivery of the kit, but we have since lodged with
Registry to inform them that the address would be where the kit is kept. Please
help to resolve this with them, and inform us when it is to deliver.
However, we noted given the urgency and in special
arrangements, we have arranged for the following documents to be certified by
HK professional lawyer :-
(1)    Certificate of Incorporation
(2)    Business Registration Certificate
(3)    Memorandum and Articles of
Association
(4)    Registers of Members and Directors
The said documents had been couriered to Mr. Ashford’s
address which you have given to us.
I will need to discuss with our UK office on how we would
charge the certification that we have made onto the above documents. As a
normal practice, we would not proceed with the certification without first
agreement is made on the fees to be charged for such service.
We hope this can be avoided in future. We await for your
confirmation on when we can proceed with delivery of the company kit. Thank
you.

Dear Sarah,
I later received another call from Ms. Joanne Pang, the
Senior Sales Manager at the Executive Centre, saying that they would not take
delivery of the kit, given that The Ashford Group Limited does not have any
existing agreement with their office to take delivery of the kit, nor that they
are willing to provide the address to be used as the Location of the Registers.
Please clarify this with the Executive Centre if there is
a need and let us know what you need us to do now ?

Dear Sarah,
Or as alternative methods of arranging this, we would

Please ask the courier to quote the company name in order
for us to release the kit to the correct person. The person would need to sign
an acknowledgment receipt of the documents before collection as standard
procedure.
The kit is ready now for collection.
The collection of the kit would effectively means the kit

be held responsibilities for the completeness and safety of the kit. Thank you.

Processing Centre, 1805 Wheelock House, 20 Pedder Street, Hong Kong.
We have confirmed early this week that the records are
ready for delivery provided that you would inform us the person to whom we
should attention the register for acknowledgment of receipt of the said
records, which are considered legal documentations of the Company.
As a repeated reminder that such records COULD NOT BE
KEPT OUTSIDE HONG KONG and there is no such fillings which would allow you to
register the records as being kept outside Hong Kong. Although we have no
control whatever the directors would do with the records after they took
possession of the same. But as an officer and acting company secretary of the
Company, we are unable to comply with the requests which we would know in
contravening with the prevailing legal legislation governing the operations of
a Hong Kong company.
You may consult Companies Ordinance ss. 74A(3), 88(3),
89(3),95(3), 119A(2) & 158A(2)) should you have any doubts.
Please therefore let us know who is the person to take
possession of the record at the address in Hong Kong and the telephone number
and we can deliver anytime !

Dear Sarah,
Sorry for the insistence. As the documents that we are
going to send are statutory records(most of it in originals), we must have
someone that we could attention to, and to acknowledge receipt of the said
documents by the appointed person. He/she would need to chop with their
company’s acknowledge receipt in order for us to safely deliver the goods.
Therefore please give us the contact person and telephone
number of the receiving party.
As mentioned, the statutory records are in order and we
can deliver anytime. Thank you.
