Dear Felix,

 

Thank you for your email and please allow me to apologise for the delays you
have experienced to date.

 

I can assure you that we, at all levels within Barclays, take your concerns
extremely seriously and will endeavour to make them right as soon as
possible.

 

The reason you did not hear from me since Thursday until now, was that I was
investigating who, within the business, would be best placed to meet with Mr
Kirkland. I apologise that this took longer than you were expecting.

 

The best person to take this forward would be my colleague Izabela Wilk and
she will be in contact with you today to arrange an appointment.

 

Your complaint is being investigated and you will receive correspondence
regarding this in due course.

 

Thank you once again for your patience and my apologies again that you felt
the need to complain in this instance.

 

Kind regards,

 

Lee.

Mr. Jenkins,

 

I would like to bring to your attention that my company has been giving
Barclays a number of clients and we prefer to send them to Barclays as
compared to RBS. However this last experience has been very  unsatisfactory
and not at all professional.

 

We usually take appointments for our clients over the phone. I made a call
around a week back and spoke to numerous agents for an appointment for one
of my clients and spoke to Jill Heathely,Richard and I believe Steve to name
a few. They informed me at first after putting me on hold for around 5 to 8
minutes that one of the account managers would get back to me.I waited the
whole day and no one called than I called the following day and got another
rep on the phone they said that the reason for no call back was due to the
phone number it seems the other did not take down the correct number. The
rep corrected the number and promised me a call. I waited right up to 5pm as
I know that they are pretty busy but I did not even get a call. I called the
next day and the rep said that the number was still not corrected and he
went on updating it and said that the account manager would call.

 

I did  get a call from Mr.Dellar whom asked for some additional information
from the client. I got that information and he said that I could email it to
him. I did send him the email and he wanted some more clarification from the
client. I got that for him as well and emailed it to him at this point my
client was very annoyed and I managed to retain him from cancelling the
order.

 

I sent two emails to Mr. Dellar and have not got any response from him.
Please make a note of it and I would appreciate a reply on this or I would
be looking for other options. I will be posting this email on Test Pilot and
other blogs along with a reply from Barclays.

 

Waiting for a response.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

Mr.Dellar,

 

The answers to your questions are given below.

 

1.       There are no are specific companies as yet, we will market it to
different companies

2.       Contract are not already in place, USD 2.5m is just an expected
annual turnover

3.       Will provide consulting for Small to mid-size oil contracts mainly
as well as some mineral contracts

 

Further details:

 

The company is not buying and selling commodities and is not - and never
will be - Â any kind of licensed commodities broker.

Selkie Consulting is an international business consultancy offering services
to companies looking to engage in commerce with buyer or sellers outside
their normal sphere of engagement.

We provide due diligence services, verification of business history,
verification of credentials and identity so that both parties can feel
comfortable in engaging in business.

We hand hold through the engagement and subsequent business transactions and
make sure everything runs smoothly and for this we charge consulting fee for
all ongoing business.

We do have some serious interest from both buyers and sellers looking to
engage in some small oil contracts and once we successfully bring them both
to the table I can see a strong growing business model in the African
region.

I hope this short snap shot will make the company strategy clear to Barclays
and we can move on and open the account.

 

Regards,

 

Felix Almeida.

Dear Felix,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

May I clarify a few points please:

 

1.       Which companies in these countries will the business be trading
with initially?

 

2.       The Amount / Transaction is us$500K. Is that each transaction, or
is that the anticipated 1st years turnover through the business? I was
informed that contracts were already in place for US$2.5m. If so, can you
let me have details of these contracts please.

 

3.       The business activity is consulting. Can you please expand on
that. Who will the business be consulting with and what will the business be
providing by way of services or products?

 

Many thanks, Felix.

 

Kind regards,

 

Lee.
