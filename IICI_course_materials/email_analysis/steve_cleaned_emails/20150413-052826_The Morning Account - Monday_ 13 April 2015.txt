IFS criticises tax plans as Osborne defends IHT proposal
George Osborne has told the BBC that a Conservative plan to remove family homes worth up to £1m from IHT "supports the basic human instinct to provide for your children". The party wants to keep the percentage of estates that are liable for IHT at around 6% by raising the individual tax-free allowance from £325,000 to £500,000. Announcing the proposal, David Cameron said that a future Tory government would use a raid on pensions to fund the plan, in a move which echoed a proposal unveiled by Labour to limit pension tax relief to fund a cut in tuition fees. In response to the Conservative plans, the IFS said any benefit would go “disproportionately to those towards the top of the income distribution”. However, it also went on to criticise Labour, stating: "The two main parties seem to be competing to tie their own hands on the main tax rates whilst scooping up apparently free money from 'the rich', non-doms and tax avoiders.” It comes as Ed Miliband prepares to announce a guarantee today that every Labour policy commitment will be fully funded and not require borrowing. The Times’ editorial welcomes the Tories’ IHT proposal, arguing “if Labour and the Liberal Democrats have any sense, they'll copy it.”

Lib Dems revise property levy plans
Nick Clegg says the Liberal Democrats have watered down plans for a tax raid on wealthy homeowners. The party originally said it wanted to raise £1.7bn from its proposed property levy but it now plans to raise £1bn, with £2m-£2.5m homes facing a £2,000-a-year charge, rising to £9,000 for houses valued between £4m and £5m. “It is less than originally mooted,” said Mr Clegg. “We worked it up and looked at what was reasonable, and this is reasonable and fair.” The Lib Dems have also revealed plans to raise £2bn through additional restrictions on corporation tax relief, on top of the £1bn annual bank levy already announced. A further initiative will see vehicle excise duty increased by an average £25 per car per year, in a move that will raise more than £1.3bn over two years.

Listed companies avoiding $82bn of tax
An analysis of more than 1,000 businesses by index provider MSCI indicates listed companies in developed markets are avoiding at least $82bn of tax a year by using tax havens and other minimisation strategies. MSCI estimated the size of the global corporate tax gap by calculating the average annual tax rate paid between 2009 and 2013 by the 1,505 companies in the MSCI World index. The Index accounts for about 85% of stock market capitalisation in 23 developed countries.

Esher and Walton tops survey
Esher and Walton, in Surrey, has been identified as having the highest income tax bills in the UK. Bills in the area averaged £16,900 in 2012-13, up from £15,700 a year earlier and almost four times the national average of £4,363, a study by UHY Hacker Young found. Esher and Walton residents include Gary Lineker, Frank Lampard and Mick Hucknall.

Kieran Quinn, chairman of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, has stated his intention to scrutinise corporate tax avoidance and evasion. “Clearly some of the 'examples of tax minimisation' we have heard about recently are not just about clever accountancy - in our view it is very close to criminal activity,” he says.

Greens propose 60p top rate
The Green party has announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax to 60p in the pound. Party leader Natalie Bennett said the move would bring in an extra £2bn a year for public services while acting as a disincentive to firms paying excessively high salaries.

Bank backs Carney over non-dom status
The Bank of England has defended the non-dom status of Mark Carney, insisting that he pays full UK taxes on all his earnings as governor, including his housing allowance. It comes after Labour announced plans to curtail the non-dom tax benefit if it wins the election next month.

Financial services frustrations
A survey by Options Group suggests widespread dissatisfaction amongst financial services workers. Just one fifth of participants said they were content with their job, their firm, their pay and their prospects, while half of the 100 people interviewed – who were mostly in senior positions at banks, brokers and asset managers - said they were unhappy on all four fronts.

Employers intending to hire more
Employers' hiring intentions are stronger now than in the pre-recession years, according to a report by BDO. Its latest Employment Index measures 113 for March, suggesting that firms will continue to boost jobs creation in the coming months. Meanwhile, separate research by PwC has found a sharp difference between what male and female employees want from salary add-ons and perks. “Put very simply, men tend to go for shares and pensions, while women tend to prefer medical insurance and childcare vouchers,” said the firm’s Alastair Woods.

Corporation tax plans help SMEs
The Independent’s David Prosser welcomes Labour’s plan to cancel the Budget reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% in order to finance a cut in business rates for SMEs. He says it offers some help to small businesses, which - unlike large firms - are not “well-practised in the art of avoidance” and do not have the resources to hire “sophisticated accountants and slick lobbyists.”

Starcom accounting errors highlight challenge for SMEs
Kate Burgess reflects on the recent accounting issue at Starcom, which has seen the Israeli company announce it will miss this year’s forecasts. It will also have to restate last year’s profits after incorrectly logging sales. She says it is particularly tough for small companies to judge when to report revenues on long-run projects where cash comes in later, and although Starcom’s board should be lauded for recognising the error of its accounting ways, it cannot afford to err again.

BBA: Banking rules could hit small firms
Proposed changes to the way in which banks weigh the dangers of lending could hit small firms and first-time buyers, international regulators have been warned. The British Bankers’ Association says that lending to SMEs would be hit especially hard by rules put forward by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In particular, it believes that Basel’s demand for a 300% risk-weight to be applied to small business was too severe.

ECONOMY

London property boom slowdown predicted
The CEBR believes that while house prices throughout the country are forecast to rise by 1.5% this year, prices in the capital will fall by more than twice that rate. The research group argues that changes to stamp duty in December fed through more quickly than expected and that as a result, London will be a poor performer, with property values falling by 3.6% after “years of over-performance.” It is still expected that in the longer term, underlying factors such as a lack of housing for buyers to choose from in the capital will still push prices upwards.

Web banking on the rise
According to a survey by Halifax, mobile and internet banking accounted for £15 of every £100 spent in 2014, compared with £12.42 in 2013. Cheques accounted for one transaction in every 100, but their higher value meant they made up £8.14 of every £100 spent. Debit cards remained the most popular method, used in more than half of all transactions and making up nearly £30 of every £100, according to the survey of personal account customers. Cash withdrawals were only £18.33 of every £100, down from £20.15 in 2013.
