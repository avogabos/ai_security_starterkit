Dear Ellen

 

After placing the order, you have to send us the payment.

 

Our Support team will contact you to provide documents for company
director/s. And once we receive the documents and payment, we will then
process company formation. Company will be registered within 2-3 working
days then and you will be able to download company documents from your
account at our website.

 

Regards

 

Steve Smith

FORMATIONS HOUSE
