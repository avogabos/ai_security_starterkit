Big Four embrace digital threat
The FT examines how the accounting profession is trying to embrace the disruption from new technology that could otherwise eat into its own businesses. A growing number of firms are launching partnerships with technology companies, investing in start-ups and increasingly employing the techniques used by innovative technology companies. Last year, KPMG signed a joint venture with McLaren to use predictive analytics in its audit and consulting work, while Deloitte has recently been hired by Harlequins rugby club to help make sense of the vast volumes of information it collects on its players. Tudor Aw, partner and technology sector head at KPMG Europe, says: "Companies such as Google and Amazon have three core assets: data storage, data analytics and cloud technology. They underpin the business model that we need to embrace for the future." Richard Oldfield, head of strategy at PwC UK, adds: "There is no single technological threat to the professional services industry. It's a tsunami of threats: data analytics, artificial intelligence and cyber security." Fiona Czerniawska, managing director at Source Consulting, says that while it is likely that firms such as Google and Amazon will use techniques they have pioneered for analysing big data to offer new services in the marketplace, "it's hard to see them penetrating the business-to-business sector, and professional services in particular because so much still depends on personal chemistry between client and professional".

Outsourcing moves east
Sharmila Devi in the FT notes that Eastern European countries are becoming a vibrant location for outsourcing. Poland now employs 150,000 people, half of them in accounting and financial services, while Bulgaria and Romania have also sought to stem a “brain drain” and boost investment by offering accountancy and administrative services to companies based elsewhere. Nick Prangnell, who leads Deloitte's global business services in consulting, points out that the trend is not just confined to Eastern Europe either: “Offshoring is growing 12 to 20% a year. The Philippines has 750,000 people doing similar work and India has 1m. Both countries have wage cost levels below 20% of the UK,” he explains. Kerry Hallard, chief executive of the National Outsourcing Association, adds that the world of outsourcing itself is on the "cusp of dramatic change" with the advent of robotics and cognitive computing to connect outsourcing buyers, suppliers and advisers.

Fraud costs NHS £1bn a year
A report conducted by PKF and the University of Portsmouth centre for counterfraud studies suggests the NHS may be losing as much as £1bn a year from fraud while procuring services. Jim Gee, the former director of counter-fraud services for the Department of Health and chief executive of the NHS Counter-Fraud Service, said the health service was missing out on huge potential savings by cutting the budget for research and investigations into the problem.

Big Four switch attention to SMEs
The FT reports that KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC are increasingly focussing on smaller businesses, as they look to gain a bigger share of clients from among the UK’s 4.9m privately owned businesses and the 125m SMEs worldwide. But the push also appears to be attracting scepticism amongst high street accountants. When asked if the Big Four "can compete with the high street for business", 77% of the 88 readers polled by Accountancy Age said "no". KPMG has suggested that accountants should not just perform simple tasks for small businesses but offer services such as warnings on cash flow. However, Bivek Sharma, head of small business accounting at KPMG, says small companies have often shied away from asking accountants for greater insights for fear of a large bill.

NAPF warns against Isa-style shift
The NAPF has said that a shift to an Isa-style taxation system for UK pensions would not bring in savings for the government and could instead cut the tax take by 15%. The chancellor is currently considering options to tackle an estimated £50bn of tax forgone by the Treasury each year to encourage pension saving. "Under the current system, pound for pound saved before tax, higher earners generally get a lower amount of pension to spend and pay more tax on their pension savings than lower earners," said the NAPF. Meanwhile, a report by the Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) has found women, ethnic minority workers and employees in the service sector are less likely to qualify for automatic pension savings. Since automatic enrolment began to be introduced in 2012, more than 5m people have been enrolled. But a total of 4.8m people are ineligible and not saving in a pension scheme. The PPI report suggested that 32% of employed women were ineligible to be enrolled automatically compared with 16% of male workers. And 30% of workers with disabilities did not meet qualifying criteria.

SMEs face pensions challenge
Anthony Hilton in the Standard suggests that SMEs are facing an unprecedented challenge due to the requirement to enrol employees into a pension scheme. According to the pensions regulator, of the 1.8m small-firm employers who will be required to begin the staging process between now and 2018, two thirds employ between one and four workers while 16% employ five to nine people and one in six has between 10 and 49. Research by Now Pensions suggests that the majority of these firms will have no existing pension scheme and will have little to no idea about what is expected of them in setting one up. Furthermore, Mr Hilton says that despite the government’s efforts, most people will end up saving nowhere near enough for a comfortable retirement.

UK landfill tax fraud raids
Officers from HMRC and local police have arrested fourteen people as part of an investigation into a suspected multimillion-pound landfill tax fraud. The operation into the suspected £78m operation is said to have targeted six commercial and eight residential addresses in Gateshead, Washington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Leeds and Hull. Simon York, director at HMRC's fraud investigation service, said: “Today’s activities are the culmination of 18 months’ painstaking investigation into the suspected systematic abuse of the landfill tax system. We believe that over £78m revenue may be involved, money which could be used to fund some of the UK’s most vital public services. No one is above paying their fair and legal share of tax, as the rest of us do, and we are closing in on those who try to cheat the system".

Cut income tax? It would be Holyrood not to
Ben Thomson, the former chair of the Reform Scotland think tank, has told Holyrood’s finance committee that the country should cut its income tax by 2p in a move that he says would "give a really good message that you're doing something positively". New powers are to be granted to the Scottish government from 2016 with the UK Treasury to deduct 10p from the rate of income tax in Scotland, leaving MSPs to decide whether to keep the rate the same as the rest of the UK, or to raise it or lower it.

Begbies highlights insolvency downturn
A statement from Begbies Traynor ahead of its annual shareholder meeting shows corporate insolvencies in the UK fell by 12% in the first half to just over 8,000, compared with nearly 9,000 last year. The Times’ Tempus column notes that despite its position as the market leader in insolvencies, Begbies should be relatively relaxed about the current climate since its property division is likely to provide strong earnings.

BoE’s Broadbent says wages set to rise
Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent says average real wages will be boosted as Britain moves away from a lower skilled economy. Mr Broadbent said in a speech yesterday that the relative availability of low-skilled and inexperienced workers had helped depress productivity and wages in the post-recession period. He added that a strengthening economic recovery in the rest of Europe would reduce the relative supply of low-skilled labour.

Sharing economy is sweeping the world
Lauren Davidson in the Telegraph looks at which countries and cities are driving the sharing economy phenomenon. According to research from JustPark, an online parking service, London is home to 72 sharing economy start-ups, making it the third biggest creator city behind New York (89) and San Francisco (131). Figures from PwC show that the industry is worth $15bn per year and is projected to soar to $335bn in 10 years. The UK sector is set to grow from £500m to £9bn over the next decade.

Scottish firms want to stay in EU
A study by Henderson Loggie has found Scottish manufacturers overwhelmingly support the UK staying in the EU ahead of next year's referendum.

Ermotti: Honest mistakes are acceptable
Sergio Ermotti, the chief executive of UBS, has moved to dispel a culture of post-crisis fear among bankers by suggesting that top managers can take more risks and make mistakes – as long as they are honest ones. Speaking at an event in Zurich, Mr Ermotti said there should be a “degree of tolerance” for mistakes. He explained that if people are too afraid, legitimate business might not be pursued, which would be damaging for both the bank and its clients. A report from PwC published over the summer warned that a tougher approach to poor performance in financial services is creating a climate of fear. Andrew Hill in the FT agrees with Mr Ermotti but adds that a bank’s culture needs to be stronger enough to prevent any doubt in the minds of employees about what constitutes an honest mistake. A leader column in the paper states that banks cannot prosper within a culture a fear and that there is little to fear from the risks taken by well-capitalised banks.

Female degree-holders earn more
An analysis of tax data by the IFS and Cambridge and Harvard universities has found women with degrees earn at least three times as much as a non-graduates within a decade of leaving university. By contrast, median earnings of men 10 years after graduation were about twice those of a non-graduate. The study used tax records and student loan data for 260,000 people for the tax year 2011-12.
