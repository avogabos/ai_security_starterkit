The Choice of Fortune 500s <http://app.en25.com/e/er?s=1464&lid=668&elq=b1004d8c0ed6401585f5cac6d6abd47c>                                 
No one has to tell you: There’s a new worker in town, and they’re mobile. Truth is, with nearly two-thirds of corporate employees accessing content outside the office, a comprehensive mobile strategy isn’t a nice-to-have – it’s an absolute business necessity.

Box’s new white paper – “Empowering Your Mobile Worker <http://app.en25.com/e/er?s=1464&lid=668&elq=b1004d8c0ed6401585f5cac6d6abd47c>” – is brimming with insights and strategies you can leverage now.
