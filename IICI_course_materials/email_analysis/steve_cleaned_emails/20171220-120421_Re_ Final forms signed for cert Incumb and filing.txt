Dear Support and Steve
Please find attached the signed forms requested.
Appreciate confirm all is in order now and the cert of incumbency can be notarized?
Can you also give us an indication of when we can expect the notarized cert? Will it be possibleÂ before end of December?
Best regards

Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that in order to issue original copy of incumbency and notarize it, registry requires the share transfer forms to be signed and email to them so that they can update their records and notarize the correct incumbency.
They will not issue or notarize the original incumbency until unless they receive the signed share transfer forms.
We request you to please forward us the signed forms as soon as possible.
Best Regards,
Customer Support
