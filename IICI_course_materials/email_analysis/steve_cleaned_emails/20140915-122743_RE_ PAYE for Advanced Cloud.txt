Hi Charlotte/Steve


I called Martin Joseph at your office about a PAYE question, but I got cut off.


Can you ask him to either call me on +44 7808 774179 or better email me with this query.


I am also getting concerned about the year end accounts preparation.


Can you tell me what is the next step?


Thanks

Chris

Hi Charlotte

Is everything setup for PAYE for Advanced Cloud?

We expect the first payslip to be required in October as we are getting revenue coming in at the end of September.

Can you also prepare the invoice for the end of year accounts preparation and remind me of what you need from us.

Many thanks
Chris
