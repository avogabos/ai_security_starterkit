Hi Steve

I hope you are well.  You recently created a company for us, Faradi Price.  We have now settled on a new name and would like to get this registered asap.  The new name is
       Divergent UK  Ltd

I have checked on webcheck and this is available.  Please let me know what we need to do to effect this asap.  And of course, bank details so I can pay you.

Regards

John Price

Hi John

Image size for credit card payment authorization form is very small and when we enlarge it the information get blur (attachment).

Please increase the size/quality of picture on camera/cell phone and then take the picture and send it to me.

It is almost 4:30, I will try to process payment and submit application before by 5pm.

Please reply as soon as possible.

By the way new copy of Ms. Farhadi passport is perfect.

Regards

Steve..

Hi Steve


Attached is a photo of the cc auth form.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Re the blue form - application details - You have omitted the name of Ms. Farhadi's other company  '  Faradi Financial Solutions Ltd'

Hopefully you have now received the additional copy passport and we a all set.

Have a good weekend.

Regards

John
