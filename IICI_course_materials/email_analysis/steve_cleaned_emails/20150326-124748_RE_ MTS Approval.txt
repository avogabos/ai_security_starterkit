Hi

 

 

Following customer wish to use our Managed Tax Service (not our customer),
please advice we can give the service.

 

 

 

I am interested in the Managed Tax System service your company provides. I
am a new UK Limited company and would like to start trading as a VAT
registered. It is necessery for my supplier and for my clients. I am in the
proccess of registration for VAT in the UK but don't have documents to
support my business. I was considering temporary measure to use your Managed
Tax System as I have both supplier, who is EU business with VAT(Non-UK) and
also customer who is also EU business with VAT (Non-UK). I would like to
know if you can assist me and how the proccess works in order to send
payment to my supplier and recieve payment from my
customer.

 

 

I am starting business in import/export trading company in the UK. Intention
is to buy rainwater tanks from Germany manufacturer. I need VAT so they can
apply zero-rate VAT as for exporting goods to other EU country. I have a
customers in Slovakia, Czech Rep. where I would like to sell the products
to. They are business responsible for paying VAT so again, I need to be VAT
for the transaction in order to apply zero-rate VAT in the UK as the
products go for export. thus "intra-Community supply" transaction applies.
So it is trading where I only accounts in the UK. Volume of buying would be
around £13000. Selling around £16000 and money will be recieved from
Slovakia or Czech Rep. depending which customer I will sell it to. Money
will be recieved via Bank Transfer. Is it something you would be able to
work with?
