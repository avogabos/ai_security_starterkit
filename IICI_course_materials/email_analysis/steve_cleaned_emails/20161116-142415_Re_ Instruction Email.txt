Hi Steve,

As Agreed, please note that today I paid £175 for director privacy invoice. I also attached a copy of my passport as requested in order to cancel director privacy ASAP. I will email you the rest of the documents as per your request hopefully this week.

One more thing, I believe that we both agreed that I pay £150 and not £175. Please refund the £25.0.

Regards,

Sam

Dear Sam
Soon after 2014 when Companies House started giving company information for free to general public our administration cost to keep our clients address confidential increased so to cover expenses it was required that we increase the price.
As you can see a screen shot from company registrar in my previous email that your service address is our address and since 2014 numerous unsolicited/spam/junk communication we have faced which are addressed to you, we have kept you secure free of cost. Service gives our clients security that is why we never remove the service until client ask for removal.
