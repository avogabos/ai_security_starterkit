Dear Steve,
Thanks for your reply.
But i did order for this Company 1st of November 2017 and noticed new address and asked changed to Harley street, you did not say me anything
about this situation. Thats really problem now because we already provided POA with old address to bank and now there should be new POA with new
address and new apostille. Thats all cost money and of cause client will not pay for it.
And please check CH for Eurolifter Technologies.
It says
Confirmation statement overdue
Next statement date
27 October 2017
due by
10 November 2017
Last statement dated
27 October 2016
But i know you e-filed it and in filing history there is notificiation
03 Nov 2017                
                
                

Confirmation statement made on 27 October 2016 with updates
So why it is overdue. Please can you be so kind to make it ok at CH?
If Bank also notices overdue Confirmation statement, bank just will block client's account
:((((((
Thanks in advance,
Best wishes.
Ekaterina.
