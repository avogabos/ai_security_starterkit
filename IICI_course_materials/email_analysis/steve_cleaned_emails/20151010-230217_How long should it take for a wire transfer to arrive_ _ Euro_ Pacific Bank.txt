    Wire Transfers   
 The majority of international transactions are facilitated through the SWIFT network. Although widely accepted there are some things you should know.      
        
   Speed   
 The SWIFT payment network is slow. It originated in the 1970s before the advent of the Internet and hasn't changed much. Allow 3-5 days for a successful transfer.            
        
   Process   
 SWIFT doesn't transfer money, it sends messages from one bank to another. This means we may have to hold the incoming funds for up to 72 hours before crediting the client's account.            
        
   Assistance   
 The SWIFT payment network is complicated. Wire instructions can be confusing and the standardization of forms does not yet exist. We're experts, come to us for help.
