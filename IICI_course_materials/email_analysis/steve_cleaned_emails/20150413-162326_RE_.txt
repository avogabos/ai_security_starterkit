Hi Steve

That was by mistake. Thanks for the response. I'll get onto those required
documents for you asap. You said the CV needs to be detailed. Do you mean 
that
we must indicate our full employment history even if it can fill 10 pages 
or so?
Or shall we have the most recent and most relevant information like when 
using
the CV to apply for work?

And please specify what you mean by "business activity details". Will a 
typed up
description of our business activity suffice, such as what we do to earn
profits? Or do you need more? Any specific documents perhaps?
