Waiting for your answer to continue partnership.

UK (LLP) Limited Liability Partnership:
UK LLP is ideal for foreign nationals looking for a tax-efficient commercial structure, whilst maintaining a corporate presence in the UK. A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a company established between at least two partners.
An LLP allows for a tax-efficient strategy as they are considered “fiscally transparent” by HMRC, so the Partnership itself is not taxed; only the profits that go directly to the partners are taxed. As the partners are taxed directly, this means:
- Non-UK residents will only pay UK tax on income that was earned in the UK, so any trade occurring offshore from the UK will only be taxed at the partner’s usual tax rate, depending on their country of residency;
The cost to register a LLP company in the UK is 500 GBP; the time required to complete the procedure is 3-4 weeks.
The two basic requirements to form a UK LLP are:
1. A registered address in the UK (i.e. England, Scotland or Wales)
2. Minimum two partners required. (human or corporate)
If you cannot provide 2nd partner for UK LLP, then you can choose Nominee Partner service for GBP 500 per annum. We will register an offshore company for you by appointing you as the director and shareholder in the offshore company and appoint the offshore company as the 2nd partner in UK LLP.
