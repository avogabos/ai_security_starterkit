Dear Mr Fedida

ETRADUP LIMITED

Thank you for your e-mail of 16/02/2015 about the overdue accounts for
the period ending 31/12/2013.

As you require the company to remain on the register, we have stopped
the strike off action.  However, failure to file accounts within the
statutory time allowed is a criminal offence.  Due to the seriousness of
the default, no further time can be given and we will shortly be issuing
prosecution warning letters to each of the directors.  Conviction of
this offence will result in a criminal record and a fine of up to £5,000
for each document not delivered on time.

You may be able to deliver certain types of accounts online via our Web
Filing service, which has in-built checks to ensure that you get it
right first time. Our web-site www.companieshouse.gov.uk gives
information on this along with a full range of guidance booklets and
forms.

As the accounts are already late, the company will automatically incur
a civil late filing penalty when Companies House receives and registers
them.  The amount of the penalty increases with the length of delay in
delivery and is separate to any criminal proceedings being considered
against the directors.  If you file accounts late in two consecutive
years, the penalty will be double for the second year’s accounts.

Please note, this company’s Annual Return (Form AR01) for the period
ending 28/01/2015 is due for filing no later than 25/02/2015

Yours sincerely


Mr O Robins
Compliance Case Officer
