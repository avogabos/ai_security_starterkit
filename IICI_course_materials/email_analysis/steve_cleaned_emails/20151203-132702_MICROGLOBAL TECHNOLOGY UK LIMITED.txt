Hi, this is the feedback from bank re clients questions: 

 

Due to recent changes in our settlement instructions, Euro Pacific Bank will
no longer be offering USD incoming wires for corporate clients. As such, in
the near term the Bank will be focusing on our non-USD currencies, which
include EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, JPY, CHF, PLN and CAD. 

 

This does not impact your use of:

 

1. USD outgoing wires

2. USD bank cards

3. USD currency conversions

4. USD deposit accounts

5. USD investments

 

To compensate new clients for this in inconvenience we are offering a free
currency conversion program if you would still like to have your non-USD
wires credited in USD:
https://europacbank.com/support/free-currency-conversions-usdfx0/.

 

Please confirm the client's understanding and acceptance of the above
changes to the capacity of his future EPB bank account via responding to
this email. After receiving confirmation we will gladly continue the
application process.
