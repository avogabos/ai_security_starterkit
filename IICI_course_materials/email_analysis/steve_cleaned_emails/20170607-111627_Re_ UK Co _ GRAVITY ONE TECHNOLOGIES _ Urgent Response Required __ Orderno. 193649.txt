Hi Steve,

I believe your generalised documents are adopted from GOV UK so it will be fine to use...Only me as the full shareholder will be the subscriber in the memorandum. Thank you.

Regards,

K Ubhi.

Dear Mr. Karanvir Ubhi

Thank you for the sending the documents. Note that we will use address for director and shareholder as per bank statement provided by you.

One last confirmation, you have purchased ‘Company formation using customised Articles & Memorandum of Association’, you need to draft and send us the memorandum and articles or you want us to use our own generalize memorandum and articles.
