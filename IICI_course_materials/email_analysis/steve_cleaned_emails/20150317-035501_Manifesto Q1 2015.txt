MANIFESTO Q1 2015

THE THIN RED LINE
Beach Republic has recently welcomed Paul Shine as Ocean Club Manager. Hailing from
Colorado, Paul has been living in Thailand for three years. With Bed Supper Club and the ultra-cool Maggie Choo’s under his belt, he is ready to take Beach Republic to the next level. Check out his new Weekly Lineup. http://www.beachrepublic.com/events/

NEW OUTPOSTS AT THE REPUBLIC
In recent months, for the enlightenment and better living of its Citizens, Beach Republic added two brand new outposts - Escapology and Whisgars.

Escapology
Escapology offers two thrilling live escape games that have to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Locked in a series of rooms during the Cuban Missile Crisis with 60 minutes until Nuclear annihilation, do you have what it takes to solve the clues, save the world, and make your escape?

Whisgars
A unique concept bar with branches throughout Asia, Whisgars provides high-end Single Malt Whiskies and Premium Hand-Rolled Cigars in a luxurious setting. Chill Different.

THE REPUBLIC TAKES NEW TERRITORY - BEACH FRONTAGE INCREASES BY 70%
The Treaty of The North saw Beach Republic expand into new territory adjacent to the
main Ocean Club. This haven of beach front relaxation includes massage salas and sun
loungers set amidst swaying palm trees. Our Citizens now have 70% greater stretch of
beach frontage on which to do their thing.

EXPANSION - AZUR SAMUI
Developed by the Beach Republic team, Azur Samui is comprised of a selection of
superbly designed luxurious apartments and Private Pool Villas. Located in Maenam on
the North side of the island, owners at Azur enjoy spectacular views out over the Gulf and to neighboring Koh Pha Ngan. Phase 1 is 100% sold out, and the luxurious villas are also selling fast.
