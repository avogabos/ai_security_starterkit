Dear Steve Smith
Thank you for the quick response.
I have a few questions for Virtual Office:
1. We will have a postal address (and box) in London?
2. We will have your phone number in London and the Secretary will be taking calls or answering machine? From 9 am to 18 pm or not?
3. We will have your e-mail in the format "hello@heptagon.со.uk"?
Kind regards

Dear
Vladyslav Teliuk
Thank you for the information.
Please see the attach invoice to arrange the payment by bank transfer. Once payment is done, please email me the bank transfer receipt along with following documents of yourself (Vladyslav Teliuk).
1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)
If the documents are not in English then you need to have them translated and notorized. And send original and translated copies.
Please provide us with the above mentioned documents and payment information as soon as possible so that we can activate the services.
