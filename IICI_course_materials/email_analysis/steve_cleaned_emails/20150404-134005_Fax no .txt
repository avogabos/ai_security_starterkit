Dear Steve,

Do we have any news on the fax issue concerning the fact that it does not work when trying to send a fax to the "correct" number?
Further can we please amend the fax no on the website details since we have placed a (2) in the place where (0) should be?

I know I have burdened you a lot but I intend to bring more business in and as you already know I have two more companies that I am about to transfer over to your services with immediate effect.
I value all the support you have shown throughout our cooperation and I wish to continue with more.

Finally, I wish you inform you that this week all has been finalized with the bank and we can finally commence doing business with them with immediate effect.

In anticipation of your reply I thank you in advance for all your help once again.

Best regards,

Maria
