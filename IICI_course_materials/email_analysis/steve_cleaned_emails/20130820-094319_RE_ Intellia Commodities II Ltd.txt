I cannot help now, the branch is aware that the turnover is 1 million, so
will not suddenly accept that is now £300,000

I spoke to customer

 

And they admit that they made a mistake in the bank by saying about turnover
to be 1 million rather than 300000 as mentioned, can we speak to bank
correct this and open the bank account.
