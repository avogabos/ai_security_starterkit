Hi Steve,

 

Thank you for contacting us regarding a company formation. It is our goal to simplify this process for you by working with you to give you the most cost effective, and efficient process possible. Details of our service for foreign Directors are found in our Premium Pack which I have outlined below. 

 

We manage the whole incorporation process for you and email you your documents with full instructions at every stage. The timelines for this depend if you require PPS numbers or not. The process is as follows:

 

1.     You fill in the company details on our form through the Packages Page here:  <http://www.irishformations.ie/packages> www.irishformations.ie/packages

2.     We email you signature pages and you post them back to us. (Same day if processed before 3pm)

3.     We incorporate the company and wait for the company number. (Duration is 3-5 days from when we receive the signature pages.)

4.     Once your company is formed your Bank account can be opened immediately.

5.     We register the company for Corporation tax and VAT with your PPS Numbers. If you do not have PPS numbers we can assist in acquiring these. Duration to register for VAT & Corporation Tax is 7-10 working days.

6.     We post you all your legal documents and make them available for download through our website.

 

All Companies in Ireland must register for Corporation TAX so this is the most cost effective pack for you. If you need a registered office this can be provided also. We use two partner firms in our business centre to manage this.  

 

1.          A registered office with Atrium Business Centre (Cork) ( <http://www.atriumbc.ie> www.atriumbc.ie) is €50.00 +VAT Per Month.

2.          A registered office with Dublin Serviced Offices (Dublin) ( <http://www.dso.ie> www.dso.ie ) is from €20.00 +VAT per month paid annually.

Every company in Ireland is required to have a registered office within the state. You can also provide this address if you wish. It cannot be a P.O. Box.

 

Bank Account Opening is included and managed either with AIB Bank or Bank of Ireland depending on your needs. 

 

The details of the pack are as follows and it contains:

 

Company Certificate of Incorporation 

Memorandum and Articles of Association 

Directors and Secretary’s Booklets

Official Share Certificates

Schedule of Directors, Members & Secretary Document

Company Seal (For Embossing Official Documents)

Company Register Hard Book

Vat & Corporation Tax Registration in Ireland

Witness Signatures for Incorporation 

First Annual Return Included in Price

FREE One Hour Consultation with an Accountant

First Meeting Minutes of the Company

Digital Documents by Email

All Third Party Fees Included for the Incorporation

Free downloads of all legal documents for incorporation

Free Post Formation Support

3 to 5 Day Fast Formation Service

Free Limited Company Name Check

Free Bank Account Opening

 

The cost which includes free bank account opening is €445.00+VAT (VAT is charged where appropriate)

 

We would recommend registering for PPS numbers also. PPS numbers can be attached to a Corporation Tax & VAT Registration. This is charged separately. You can apply with our agent, or apply yourself by visiting Ireland.

 

To go ahead you will need to register on the site to take an account with us. You can register on the following link:
