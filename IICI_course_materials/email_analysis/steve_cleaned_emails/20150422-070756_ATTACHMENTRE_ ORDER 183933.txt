Hi Andrea,
To reactivate this company, we will need to have the approval of the director who was appointed at the time the company Dinosaur LTD was dissolved.
I don't think this will be something very easy to get.
Unless you know that director.
We have other readymade companies for sale on the following website:
http://www.formationshouse.com/search/readymade.php
You can have a look and let me know if you would be interested in any of them.

The above changes happened after filing of annual return which was in june 2014, Therefore you will need to file annual returns again to have these info updated at Companies House
Regarding the name change for
Sherden, the new name contains a sensitive word that is why is it is taking some time at Companies House to be changed.
