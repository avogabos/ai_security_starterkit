I think there is a serious problem with our online payment system. Please
get someone to check our online payment processing system to thoroughly test
it.

 

Most of the cards are getting rejected and in some cases our system shows
that payment is rejected but when client checks with bank, payment is
charged.

 

Even cards of those clients are being rejected who have been our clients for
so long and using the same card since.
