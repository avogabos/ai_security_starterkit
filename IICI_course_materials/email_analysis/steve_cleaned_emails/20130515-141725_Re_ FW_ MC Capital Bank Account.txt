Can you please send me both bank transfer receipts so that we
can track payment.
Also I have again asked today to our bank account processing
team to update me regarding appointment for UK bank. I will update you as soon
as I have an update.
Thank you for your cooperation.

MC Capital Bank Account
Hi Steve
Regarding
the invoice for the creation of the MC Capital offshore account, I have paid
£250 against this invoice today and Aleks will be paying another £250
later today.
In
terms of the UK account did you have any luck with the appointment, I would
like to get all bank accounts set up by the end of May if possible.
Thanks
Chris
