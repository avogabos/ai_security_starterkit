Dear Mr Steve,
I had written the software name by which it will open. That is a basic software to make designs. If they do not have that I can easily understand the product quality which will be delivered. I need to talk to you immediately. Kindly send me your contact number ASAP. I am in London now. 
Thanks

Dear Mr. Steve,
Greetings from
Siddhartha Das Gupta.
Thanks for the
mail.
Kindly do note
that you may drop ( cancel) the idea of  the making of the Business
Cards.
There are 2
reasons for it :
1. You have
written that you  informed that as per terms you can print one side only.
That's fine , but it would not serve my purpose.
so better not do it and
please note I do not require any refund or credits for the
cancellation.
2. I have done
our business cards from London only today --- Just for your information I have got
it designed , printed and delivered within
two hours only, that too excellent quality and design.  I feel may be
that your company is tied up with the wrong people.
I will try to
send you a copy of the Business Cards and letter heads and a designer cup which
I have done today. I am sure you will love to see the work and the concept.
I am sending you
the design of the Logo of our company , freshly for your designing purpose .
Kindly open the attachment sent herewith and forward it to your designing team.
You have to open it
with Corel Draw
. I am sure your designing team will have the
software.
I had requested
for a contact number or the contact person who will do the designing , kindly
keep a note of that and let me know.
I would not like
to waste time for designing not as per my mind set.
So far the
accounting package is concerned , its O.K , kindly send it when it is done.
Take care.
With
sincere compliments & best wishes....
Dr. Sir. Siddhartha Das Gupta

it as per our terms and show you the design for approval.
And sorry the accounting software is still in the upgrading
process. Will update you as soon as it is available.
