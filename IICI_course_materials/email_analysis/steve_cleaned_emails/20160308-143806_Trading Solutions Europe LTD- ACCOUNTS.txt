Dear Account Centre,


I am still expecting the Annual Accounts of TSE Ltd for the period 
ending 30 Sept 2015 for my approval.  Order 181014  for that service has 
been already paid.
You have promised to send them at the end of_*Jan-16.
Now we are in process of closing the company and we need to submit 
accounts ASAP.
*_

Please update me regarding this matter.

I've asked to give me the contact person in my last email whom I may 
call and ask reg my company but haven't got a reply.

Regards,
Aksana Remsha.
