Hi Oliver!

 

Following our telephone conversation today (thursday mid afternoon) I am detailing my requirements to register my new company:

 

1) LLC as i am the only employee at the moment. I live mostly in New York working on a visa in a different industry but i can have a business online based outside the USA if I declare income to my global U.S. tax payment. I am launching my health website ‘MrHealth.com’.

 

2) Interested in The Gambia but please suggest otherwise if you have another alternative.

 

3) My company will be providing an online personal training service, blog, e-commerce suite selling affiliate and eventually my own health products e.g. training eqpt, supplements, clothing, sustainable products.

 

4) I need to trademark my domain name and logo. Do I need to register two names (MrHealth.com but also an umbrella company name - say, ‘ThehealthRevolution Ltd’? - under which other companies can be formed e.g.. MrsHealth.com?)

 

5) I require a bank account and card to receive global payments. 

 

6) A virtual office is required in London with telephone forwarding/answering/mail forwarding.

 

7) What extra costs shall i expect, are there any payments/registration necessary to UK authorities?

 

8) Any other info you think i may want to know to avoid surprises/difficulties in the future..?

 

9) I have passport copy and address proof/bills etc at my apartment here in NY.

 

Thanks Oliver! I hope to call you tomorrow and register the company.
