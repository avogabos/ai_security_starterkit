It's Christmas, Eve!
What did the beaver say to the Christmas Tree?
Nice gnawing you!
What did the stamp say to the Christmas card?

Entering Heaven
at Christmastime!
Three men died on Christmas Eve and were met by Saint Peter at the pearly gates.
"In honour of this holy season," Saint Peter said, "You must each possess something
that symbolizes  Christmas to get into heaven."
The first man fumbled through his pockets and pulled out a lighter. He flicked it
on. "It represents a candle," he said. "You may pass through the pearly gates," 
Saint Peter said.
The second man reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. He shook them
and said, "They're bells." Saint Peter said, "You may pass through the pearly gates."
The third man started searching desperately through his pockets and finally pulled
out a pair of women's glasses.
St. Peter looked at the man with a raised eyebrow and asked, "And just what do those
symbolize?"
The man replied,

"They're Carol's."

Dear Steve,
Happy Christmas to you and yours!

Séan Kavanagh
"Every Christmas we prepare a special Christmas Edition of Good Company to give 
all our friends and clients a good chuckle at  this wonderfully happy time of the
year."

For far more years than I care to remember here at CFI we have published a special
Christmas Edition of Good Company  - full of jokes, witticisms, rhymes, Christmas
Carols, words of wisdom and - if the truth be told - terrible festive puns and one-liners.
And this year is no exception!
Welcome to Christmas Good Company 2016...

Click on the cover of Good Company 2016 above to view and enjoy this  Special Christmas
Booklet from CFI

We hope that you get as much enjoyment from reading this specially prepared 2016
  edition of Good Company as we got from putting it all together for you.
Here you will find something old, something new and, above all, you will find gaiety
and fun, wise words  and genuine good cheer.
Our aim is to bring a smile to your face - or even two or three! Because that's 
what the true spirit of Christmas is all about. It's about sharing universal happiness
and joy. It's about extending the hand of friendship and peace as far and as wide
as you possibly can.
On behalf of all of us in CFI I'd like to wish you a very happy Christmas and a 
prosperous new year.
I like to thank everyone who did business with us the past year. We value your custom.
We enjoy being of service to you. And we hope that we will be in a position to look
after your requirements for many, many more years to come.
Happy Christmas from all of us.
Yours sincerely
Sean Kavanagh

Grandma's Mistake

Another joke from Christmas Good Company

Santa carefully positioned Tom's new laptop under the Christmas Tree. Grandma thought
it was a weighing scale.
Conclusion: Grandma weighs ?950 + VAT.
A Sign of the Times

A Seasonal Santa Joke From Good Company

As a little girl climbed onto Santa's lap, Santa asked the usual, "And what would
you like for Christmas?"
The child stared at him open mouthed and horrified for a minute, then gasped:
"Didn't you get my E-mail?"

The real trick isn't picking the right tree - it's getting it inside your home.
