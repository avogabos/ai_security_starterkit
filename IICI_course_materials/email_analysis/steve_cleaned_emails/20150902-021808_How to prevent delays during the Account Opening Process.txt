Prevent Delays 
Want to open a bank account entirely 
through email correspondence? Follow these tips:      
 
          
 
   


1) Business Activity 
Have your client be as detailed as possible when describing the business activity 


Why? 
This will provide a proper understanding of the business activity which helps to avoid additional correspondence that will delay the account opening process.      
 
   


2) Expected Transactions 
Have your client be as thorough as possible when completing the details for incoming and outgoing wire transfers 


Why? 
If the client omits details it is likely that our compliance team will request a new pre-approval form be completed in order to gather the necessary information.      
 
          
 
   

All information is kept strictly confidential
