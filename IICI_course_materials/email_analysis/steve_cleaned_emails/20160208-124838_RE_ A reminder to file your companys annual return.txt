We wish to remind you of the due date(s) for filing of the Annual Return(s)

It is a mandatory requirement for a company to file its Annual Return with
Companies House. An Annual Return is a snapshot of general information about

shareholders and share capital. If the Annual Returns are filed late, or not
at all, the Company and its Director(s) and Secretary are liable for
prosecution.

To help you in quick and efficient Annual Return (and other relevant)
filing(s), Formations House offers an Online Company Administrator service.
