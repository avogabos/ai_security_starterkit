	Unfortunately there is only a company credit card, not on a personal
name

	İ've been looking at some other doc's but it is always with company
name on it ... 

	The residence permit was renewed at the beginning of this year,
so could that work ?

	I'll take a look if someone else could make the payment as well.

	 

	Thank you

	Hi

	 

	 

	One more thing, if you choosing nominee director and nominee
shareholder and not appointing any of your own director or
shareholder, then you only need to provide proof of id and proof
address of the person who is making the payment.

	 

	When was residence permit issued?

	 

	Also do company directors have personal credit cards in their name?
if so then credit card bills must have director’s name and address
printed on it?

	 

	 

	Regards

	 

	Steve

	Hi,

	Thank you

	However there might be a small problem with the following documents:
proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR
electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement

	As we are curently living in Turkey and have a company here, all of
our official documents (utility bills, bank records) have the name and
adress of the company written on it (because we also live at our
office). We do not have any of these personal documents.

	But we can however sent you a copy of our residence permit, that is a
government document where our adress and name is written on. Would
that be OK as well?

	 

	Thank you

	Hello again

	We will probably go for a ready made ltd with nominee director and
shareholder, registered adress and virtual office

	We will take the ready made company PHD LTD (2005) but will change
the name rigt away

	Can you give me an exact quote for the services above ?

	But i do have another few URGENT QUESTIONS, we will not directly sell
goods to UK people so we will not actually have any income here, just
the office.

	How does this work with VAT/taxes,... Are we able to get an exemption
of some sort. 

	Also can you help us with the necessary administration (filing taxes
etc) and what will this cost ?

	So we will probably start the procedure today, how does that work,
what do we need to do first ?

	 

	Thank you
