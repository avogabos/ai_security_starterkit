Subject: Re: UK Co : RPA ELECTRICAL SERVICES : Orderno. 194420 : Urgent
 Response Required.
From: Rob Allen <rpaelectricalservices@gmail.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Thank you for your email.  However, one of the Directors works on a
building site and does not have access to a scanner! Your initial start up
information did not mention needing to do Due Diligence.

Your initial start up information did not mention either that you would be
charging VAT as an "add on".  Furthermore I was under the impression that
the company could be formed without complication in eight hours.

As you have not been able on this occasion to provide the service promised,
please refund the amount I have already paid.

Thank you.
