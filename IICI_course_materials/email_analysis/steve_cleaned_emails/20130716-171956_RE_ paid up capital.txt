Query from customer

 

 

What we need is the initial starting balance of Balios Finance.

This balance must show the deposit of shares Von Leuchtenberg Finance (also
owned by Mr. HW Hermann) for an amount of £ 5,250,000.

Then in the balance it must appear that the capital of the company Balios
Finance was fully paid.
