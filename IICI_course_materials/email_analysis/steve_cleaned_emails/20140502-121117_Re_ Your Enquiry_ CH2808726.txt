Dear Sir

Thank-you for your email regarding: 05411955
company name:
ZION BUSINESS ALLIANCE LTD.

The company may only be restored to the register on receipt of an Order of Court. However, in order to commence action, which would lead to an Order being granted, an application would need to be submitted.  This application would consist of a Claim Form CPR (Part 8) which would need to be sealed by a court, and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration.

You can obtain further advice on how to restore a company by logging onto the Treasury Solicitors website ? www.tsol.gov.uk

Additionally, the following paper documents and fees will be required to keep the company on the register:-


 *   accounts for 30/04/06 ? 30/04/13; and
 *   annual returns (forms 363a/AR01) for the year ending 04/04/06 ? 04/04/14 and £200 filing fees. Please be aware that there are 2 different types of form 363a AND AR01.

Having checked our records, there are no outstanding late filing penalties for this company.
Mr R. Davies
Restoration Department
