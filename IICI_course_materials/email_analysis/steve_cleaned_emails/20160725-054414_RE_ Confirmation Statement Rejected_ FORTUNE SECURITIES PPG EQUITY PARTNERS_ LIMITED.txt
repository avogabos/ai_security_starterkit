Dear Customer,
This is to inform you that the Confirmation Statement (formerly known as Annual Returns) has been rejected for your company FORTUNE SECURITIES PPG EQUITY PARTNERS LIMITED. The reason of rejection is that Nominee Secretary Ltd has been selected as the PSC office. As per company policy, Nominee Secretary LTD cannot be selected as the PSC office (Person of Significant Control). A natural person must be selected as PSC e.g. Business owner or beneficiary owner.
This is to inform you that we shall remove Nominee Secretary LTD as PSC and submit the confirmation statement to Companies House.
If you need any assistance, please feel free to contact us at
