CBI urges restraint in punishing tax dodging
The CBI has said it is vital that whilst the government takes steps to tackle abusive tax arrangements, Britain remains a “territory of choice” for international businesses. Proposed new corporate tax rules in the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project are said to be an attempt to co-ordinate tougher rules across the world, and although the CBI said the BEPS project had an important role in rebuilding public trust in the tax system, it insisted the UK should not go beyond what was necessary. Research by Richard Collier of PwC and Giorgia Maffini of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation has suggested the BEPS project will “clearly put pressure on the UK's tax competition agenda”. The CBI also indicated its main concerns relate to curbs on tax deductions for interest costs, with Will Morris, chairman of the CBI tax committee, claiming: “Interest deductibility is one of the issues that people have the most concerns about”.

Poll taxpayers on how taxes are spent
Academics at Oxford University, Saïd Business School, Harvard Business School and the University of Pittsburgh are proposing Europe's tax authorities try polling for the best ideas for how taxpayers' money should be spent. The suggestions include recommendations that when individuals fill out their self-assessment returns online, they are shown what their tax will be spent on, but also given an opportunity to set their own preferences regarding spend on healthcare, education or defence. Jan‐Emmanuel De Neve, associated professor in economics and strategy at Oxford Saïd, said: "This is an almost zero-cost proposal that has the potential to increase the number of individuals declaring and paying all the tax they owe. The tax-gap for individuals in the UK is around £4.7bn, according to HMRC, so it could make a very positive contribution to increasing the amount of tax collected".

Challenger banks going strong
Lex in the FT reflects on the collective response by challenger banks to the government’s proposed 8% tax surcharge on profits above £25m. It says that although challengers warn the tax will lead to lower retained profits and reduced small business lending, it is not clear that the banks’ smallness or newness has put them at a competitive disadvantage so far. A report from KPMG this year highlighted that the smaller challengers (the likes of Shawbrook, Aldermore and OneSavings) made a pre-tax return on equity of 18% in 2014. By contrast, big established names such as Barclays, Lloyds and RBS made just 3%.

Murphy not so major
Professor Michael Devereux, director of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, writes to the Guardian to reject suggestions that accountant Richard Murphy is "the major thinker" on tax. He says there is a wealth of serious academic work on taxation from the world's leading universities, and claims Mr Murphy's own contributions are often highly questionable.

INDUSTRY

Finance sector slows
Britain's finance industry is growing at its slowest pace in two years, according to the latest CBI/PwC financial services survey. It found optimism among financial services firms has also been shaken after two and a half years of continuous improvement. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said the stock market volatility has left a "clear mark" on the financial services sector, with impact on business volumes and investment plans.

Citizens Advice warns on debt struggles
A new report from the Citizens Advice Bureau has shown that people aged 17 to 24 sought advice on 102,296 issues related to debt in the last twelve months, a 21% rise on the previous year. Chief executive Gillian Guy believes that "many young people already face challenges getting on the career and housing ladders - doing this while saddled with huge unsecured debts make it an uphill struggle”. "We are facing the very real risk that debt becomes the norm for young people”, warned Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust.

PENSIONS

Millions miss out on pension tax breaks
New research by YouGov has found that almost three-quarters of working age people do not understand the tax benefits of saving into a pension. “This research confirms that tax relief is not well understood and calls into question whether it is really acting as an incentive to save,” said Darren Philp, director of policy and market engagement at The People’s Pension. Separately, the FT reports that company bosses are withdrawing from pension saving in record numbers, sparking concerns they will lose interest in making good provision for workers lower down the ladder.

Hargreaves claims 'game is up' for tax relief on pensions
Hargreaves Lansdown has revealed a big jump in contributions from wealthy savers ahead of the expected scrapping of higher rate tax relief on pensions. "The game is up for higher-rate tax relief; higher earners may feel that’s unfair but the chancellor needs to balance the books and where else is he going to go but to the people who have the most money," said Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Funding Circle launches float
Funding Circle has announced the float of a fund to raise £150m, meaning that it will become the first peer-to-peer lender to turn to the public market. The float is being led by Goldman Sachs and will target 8-9% returns per year, with a dividend yield of 6-7%, and giving investors the option to place the fund in a tax-free ISA. Samir Desai, Funding Circle’s founder and chief executive, claims that the fund has come about as a result of “huge demand” from investors for small business loans. Since it was set up in 2010, Funding Circle has backed £831m of lending to more than 10,000 businesses. The company claims that it was the fifth-largest net lender to SMEs in the second quarter.

Court fee rises threaten small firms
Business groups and lawyers are said to be "deeply concerned" that small businesses could be deterred from fighting disputes in London’s Commercial Court if a second jump in court fees goes ahead. The MoJ has proposed to raise the maximum fee for issuing civil lawsuits to £20,000 or more, the second such increase in the past 12 months. Jonathan Smithers, president of the Law Society, said in future small businesses could be forced into insolvency because they could not afford to recover debts and others could be put off issuing lawsuits.

SMEs want new EU treaty
Lobby group Business for Britain says most small businesses in the UK want David Cameron to negotiate a new treaty with the EU. In a poll of 601 SME owners, three-quarters wanted Britain to take back powers from Brussels so it could negotiate its own trade deals. Meanwhile, a separate poll of business leaders by the BCC found that if an in-out referendum were held tomorrow, 63% would vote to remain in the EU and 27% would vote to leave.

Metro Bank and KPMG join to help SMEs
Metro Bank has announced that SMEs opening a business account with them will now be referred to KPMG's Small Business Accounting service at no additional cost. Bivek Sharma, head of Small Business Accounting at KPMG, said: "Our new alliance minimises the time businesses have to spend confronting bureaucratic hurdles.

Looking beyond the 12-month horizon, Philip Goodstone, head of EY's legal services, said: "Beyond that we do have plans to grow but it has to be growth in the right way rather than growth for growth’s sake".

Rates speculation fuels rise in mortgage lending
Mortgage lending has increased at its fastest rate since the financial crisis, amid expectations of a rise in interest rates. Although timing of any rate rise remains uncertain, the BBA says "competitive" deals have driven increased lending. Personal loan and credit card borrowing have also increased, the BBA said. It revealed there were 80,221 home loans approved in August by the major High Street banks. Of these, 46,743 were for mortgages for house purchases, a 16% rise on the same month a year earlier.

MPC divided on rate rise
Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has played down calls for a rise in interest rates, adding to expectations that the cost of borrowing will not increase until well into next year. Mr Broadbent made it clear he was not in agreement with the MPC’s more hawkish members, despite speculation. "I was not one of those on the brink of voting for higher interest rates," he told Reuters. Elsewhere, fellow MPC member Ian McCafferty writes in the Times why he believes rates should rise as soon as possible.

Zug taxes set to increase
The Swiss canton of Zug has admitted that its famously low tax rates, which have attracted a host of companies and celebrities, may have to rise. The local government has announced a financial plan to slash the deficit over the next four years, including a possible tax increase. KPMG says a single taxpayer without children in Zug will pay a maximum income tax rate of 22.9% this year — significantly lower than in any of the main European economies.

More fines issued for minimum wage breaches
Figures released by HMRC show fines given to businesses for not paying the legal minimum wage have reached record high totals. Nearly £1m was clawed back from employers in the last financial year – over eight times as much as was the case five years ago. Separate estimates by the TUC and independent think-tanks suggest between 250,000 and 300,000 people are being unlawfully paid under the minimum wage in Britain. HMRC has also stepped up enforcement of payment rules in recent years, with 232 staff now working in its minimum wage department, up from 171 at the start of the previous financial year.
