Hi,

 

Company Name: ESENCE WOODEN FURNITURE UK LIMITED

 

This company is incorporated on 07/07/2016 through us. 

 

At the time of placing the order the share structure was provided as
follows:

 

-Mrs. Haiyan Zhou 500 

-Mr. Dongsheng Zhang 400 

-Mr. Paul Knight 100

 

But due to our system error the shares from our end have been submitted as
follows:

 

-Mr. Dongsheng Zhang 400

-Mr. Paul Knight 100

 

(500 SHARES FOR MRS. HAIYAN ZHOU HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED).

 

Attached is the company incorporation document which shows the existing
share structure.

 

Now we have received an email from client asking the share structure of the
company. Email is mentioned below:

 

"We have one question to ask, for esence wooden furniture ltd, our share
allocation is 

Haiyan Zhou 50%

Dongsheng Zhang 40%

Paul Night 10%

 

Bank told us company house shown paul night is over 20%, this is not what we
wanted, please could you double confirm this for us. many thanks for your
help!"

 

Please check into this matter and advise.

 

Best Regards,
