Dear Sir

SWISS POLO COMPANY LIMITED 05285727

Thank you for your e mail of 22/09/2014 concerning the restoration of the above company.

The company was dissolved for non filing of statutory documents- the annual return for 21/02/2013 was not filed.

There are two procedures for restoring a company to the register, which are:
            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
            - Order of Court to restore the company to the register.

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -
1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  The Bona Vacantia waiver letter, details can be found on the Treasury Solicitors
website https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bona-vacantia

3)  Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending  21/02/2013 with £40 filing fee
     Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending  21/02/2014 with £40 filing fee
Please note the Annual Returns forms can be downloaded from our website www.companieshouse.gov.uk<http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/>, there are 2 different AR01 forms, if you require any assistance, to ensure the correct form is printed, please telephone our contact centre on 0303 1234500<tel:03031234500>.

4)  Accounts for the period ending 30/11/2012 with late filing penalty of £375
      Accounts for the period ending 30/11/2013

We cannot accept a cheque drawn on the company account, as when the company
is dissolved, the company bank account is frozen.

All the required documents and fees should be sent in marked for the attention of the Restoration Section (RT01).

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8), and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court.  Information regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website - ?http://www.tsol.gov.uk? and http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk<http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/>

If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully
