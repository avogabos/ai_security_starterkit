Hi Charlotte/Steve

For months we have been waiting for RBS for this set-up this account, we
believe that Raj has everything he needs and Aleks is continually chasing
him, but no reply. This is rude and unprofessional on his part,

We can still not trade and this is getting very annoying and irritating
that no one gets back to us.

Please put yourselves in our position, we pay you £500 for a service we are
just not getting.

Can you please do me the courtesy of at least replying to my last email and
let me know if we should still pursue RBS or give up and go to another bank.

Regards
Chris

HI Charlotte
We really need your assistance with the RBS account.
Aleks has sent them everything they need, but Raj is just not getting back to him even though Aleks has chased him several times.
Please see what you can do to get this account open.
