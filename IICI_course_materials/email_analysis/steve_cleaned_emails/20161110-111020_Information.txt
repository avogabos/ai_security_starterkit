Dear Steve,

can you please inform me, how is it going with the apostilled documents?

And also, can you please inform me, that as we payed for the stater
business pack - in the price was the Value accounting - the anual tax
returns are necessary to be done when, please?

And is in the price also the registration to the income tax?

Thank you very much for your reply!

S pozdravem / Kind regards,
