Steve,

My father was out of town. I shall try to do the transaction today. We will
be using his Citibank credit card. Hope it goes through. Meanwhile I spoke
with my bank they said there's nothing wrong with my Debit Card. No blocks
nothing.

Could you tell me if this is the same gateway that we will be using?
Because it seems to be not accepting debit cards and in that case we might
loose a lot of customers.

Steve,

Could you tell me if this is the same gateway that we will be using? Because it seems to be not accepting debit cards and in that case we might loose a lot of customers.

We
tried to charge your card manually and it was declined again. I think you
should speak to your bank about this issue.
Also
in your previous email, you mentioned to use your father’s credit card.
Please try using that by making payment online. If online payment is processed
on your father’s card then we will not need his ID Documents.
To
use your father’s credit card or any other card online please go through
following steps:
1. Login to your account at our website
www.formationshouse.com
using MY ACCOUNT link and provide your Customer ID and
Password.
2. Click on 'Update Payment'
3. On the next page, click on ‘Update
Payment’ for the specific order.
4. Provide your credit card details and
check out.
Please
note your order number has been changed to
172542
Regards
Steve
