Hello,

 

Rehan could you please check our online processing system, the payments are
not going through, I have informed you yesterday as well.
check following orders:

189929
189939

189944

189932

189940

189947

 

Clients have made payment for above orders but none of the payments have
been received and all the orders are available for repayment, please check
this issue and fix it as soon as possible as this is delaying orders.

I think there is a serious problem with our online payment system. Please
get someone to check our online payment processing system to thoroughly test
it.

 

Most of the cards are getting rejected and in some cases our system shows
that payment is rejected but when client checks with bank, payment is
charged.

 

Even cards of those clients are being rejected who have been our clients for
so long and using the same card since.
