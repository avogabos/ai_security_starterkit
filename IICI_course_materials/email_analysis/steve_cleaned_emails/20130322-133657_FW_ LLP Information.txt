OK

 

Your friend will be appointed director of the Seychelles company, and Aleks
of the other. As soon as we have the Company names and numbers we will
reserve the LLP.

 

To start I need the Passport copy and copy of bank statement or utility for
each director of the Seychelles company

If you have the names in mind for the Seychelles pls give them here as
ideally we dont make up the name for you in case there is an issue.

 

As soon as we have the ID and the payment, we will incorporate the
Seychelles and start the whole process.

 

Kind Regards,

Hi Charlotte

 

Thanks for getting back to me. Its no so much I don't want to sign the bank
papers, but that they would not accept me.

 

I do have a trusted friend who can stand in for me, so can we get this
started today. 

 

What will you need from us.

 

Thanks

Chris

Hi Chris

 

The issue is due to the fact you dont want to sign the bank papers. I am
speaking with Barclays about whether they will accept a Power of Attorney to
Aleks to sign for both members and I am awaiting their feedback. We have
advised on a corporate structure for your business. We have no control over
the bank account opening issues

 

If you have a trusted associate who could stand as the director of the
Seychelles members initially then this will get around the issue and once
all accounts are open you could transfer ownership

Hi Charlotte

 

Can you please get back to me about the bank account issue the morning.

 

I am afraid we can't wait any longer than that for an answer and we will
have to look elsewhere for a company to help us.

 

We have to sign this contract on the 28th March in order for other plans to
be put in place.

 

I look forward to hearing from you

Hi Charlotte

 

Sorry to chase you on the bank account but we would like to make a decision
today and transfer the money to you so we can reserve the LLP name in order
to sign our Netsuite contracts next week.

 

Also, can we put the Cyprus bank account on hold until the current
uncertainty about their bailout is sorted out,

 

Thanks

Chris

Sorry Chris

 

In some meetings

 

Did you want UK trading address for the LLP? As that would be at 29 Harley
Street. London W1G 9QR. I didnt include the Mailing Address VO on the
Proforma, but for reference its £350 per year or £550 including Phone
Number.

 

I dont have a response on the UK bank question as yet but will chase it.

Hi Charlotte

 

Aleks has contacted his bank and they explained that with the LLP having 2
partners both of us work have to apply and its likely that I will be
rejected because of my credit history.

 

Did you have a way around this, and if so we don't mind paying the extra
£500 for this service.

 

Also, we have decided to go with the Cyprus bank account.

HI Aleks,

 

Aside from the paperwork we send to the bank in advance, there is little
else we do as you would have to attend the bank to sign. We charge simply
because many customers prefer us to be involved in communicating with the
Bank. As I mentioned, everything is optional but if you ask us to help then
we will of course charge.

Hi Charlotte,

 

Thank you for you e-mail. There is only one question. Can you please let us
know reason why 'UK Bank Account Opening

' cost 500£. As far as I remember it's a question of completing one form and
most bank do it for free. Is there additional exercises that needs to be
completed when you set up Bank Account for LLP ? 

 

Thanks you.

The bank account decision can happen once you have the Seychelles and the
LLP started. We suggest Cyprus as Aleks is less keen on Latvia.

Hi Charlotte

 

Thanks for all the information. I will go through it with Aleks on Tuesday
and let you have an answer then.

 

I think the only think we need to clarify is where the offshore bank account
would be, Cyprus or Latvia.

 

Also, the name we were after was Advanced Cloud Solutions LLP, not Services
- is this available?

 

If so can you amend the proforma invoice.

 

Thanks

Dear Chris and Alex,

Thank you for coming in to see us to discuss your new business. I have
enclosed the details regarding the LLP structure as discussed.

I propose this Onshore/Offshore structure as it will provide the UK legal
entity often required for business contracts and validity (trust) with other
businesses worldwide. The LLP is a flexible structure enabling you to add
more partners as time goes on which may other corporate entities (branches
for instance) based in other countries. 

The members of a UK LLP do not have to reside in the UK. In many cases a
corporate body residing in an offshore jurisdiction will act as the member.
This enables the beneficial ownership of the LLP in the UK to retain a high
degree of anonymity as well as provide other tax advantages.

Each member can be setup as a Seychelles LTD company, each with a single
director and shareholder. Each Seychelles Company can have its own bank
account in an offshore jurisdiction such as Cyprus and the director may have
direct access online, via cards and in person to the account. Current
concerns in Cyprus relating to the Levy on bank accounts should  not concern
new businesses wishing to open accounts there, as this levy is currently on
existing private accounts and business accounts with more than £100k on
deposit. We are told this levy is a one off measure and so do not expect it
to affect future business bank accounts. We can look at other jurisdictions
to open the account but many other jurisdictions hold strongly to the EU Tax
Treaty or do not like anonymous companies. 

A Limited Liability Partnership, LLP, is a type of business entity
registered in the UK. Like a Private Limited company (LTD) it is considered
as a corporate body with a separate legal entity. In addition, the liability
of its members is limited to their contributions only.

The primary difference between an LLP and an LTD is that a UK LLP can
operate as Fiscally Transparent. This means that any taxes on profits are
levied on the members of the Partnership and not on the Partnership itself.
The rate of tax levied on the members of the partnership is dependent upon
each members tax residency. This can become a significant advantage if the
members of the partnership are tax resident in a low or nil tax jurisdiction
as profits can be redistributed tax efficiently. 

Limited Liability Partnerships do not have directors and shareholders, they
only have partners. Each partner can be given limited liability and can be
protected from responsibility or liability for another partners misconduct
or negligence. All partners have the right to manage the LLP and at least 1
partner must be designated as the Nominated Partner.

In addition, an LLP may open a UK bank account and apply for a VAT number.
To open the account the bank will request the Nominated member to be present
(or the director of the corporate body acting as nominated member), in some
cases the bank will want all members present but it shouldnt be a problem.

The Seychelles members can also operate as businesses in their own right and
are useful where you may be signing contracts that trade outside of the UK.

In summary, an LLP setup with 2 offshore members provides a high level of
flexibility, anonymity and efficiency. 

What we provide

*	Hard copy Certificate of Incorporation 
*	The Partnership Agreement after your LLP is formed 
*	Online PDF versions of company documents 

In addition as detailed in the attached ProForma Invoice, we can provide the
Seychelles incorporations, the bank accounts and other supporting services.

 

Let me know if you require any thing further or wish to proceed.

 

Kind Regards,
