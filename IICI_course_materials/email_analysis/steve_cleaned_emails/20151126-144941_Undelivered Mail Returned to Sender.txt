Hi Sir,

 

Please can you inform us the deadline for :

CT 600 to be filled and returned and why the mentioned address is different (49-59 old street)?

CT 41 form, corporation tax to fill and return 

The payment for the corporation tax without penalties.

 

I am out of my office till the 4h of December, I could do it, but it's not easy, 

So tell me the most urgent form to be send.

 

Thank you for your answer,

Regards,

Eric Gilly
