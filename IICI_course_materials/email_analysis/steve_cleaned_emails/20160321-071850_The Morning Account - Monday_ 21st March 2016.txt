TAX

 

HMRC staffing cuts stymie offshore tax crackdown

John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, has described the OBR’s downward revision of HMRC’s projected £1bn tax grab from offshore havens as "another failure to add to an already long list for the chancellor". The chancellor promised in 2013 that tax avoidance and evasion measures would bring in £1.05bn between 2013 and 2018, reports the Times, but the OBR has revised down that forecast by £530m. Mr McDonnell said: "I have consistently asked for George Osborne to reverse the cuts to HMRC and now we discover as a result that they are overworked and under-resourced. The blame for this lies at George Osborne's door. After finally bowing to pressure to deal with offshore tax havens, he then made sure his own proposals couldn't succeed by slashing HMRC staffing at the same time. This short-sighted approach to addressing the tax gap means the chancellor is reduced instead to scrabbling around taking money off disabled people to try to meet his fantasy surplus target."

Osborne’s record examined amid Budget row

Several papers report on accusations from Iain Duncan Smith that the Chancellor’s decision to raise the 40p tax threshold in his Budget while cutting disability benefits was “deeply unfair”. Some suggest the row and Osborne’s pre-Budget climb-down over pensions changes casts doubt on his future as chancellor. The Independent’s Ben Chu looks back at some of Mr Osborne’s tax policies, but despite finding pros and cons, concludes that progressivity of the system as a whole has been lacking. Meanwhile, the Telegraph’s Steven Swinford asks whether it is really true that Mr Osborne is favouring the rich. He cites the IFS’s Paul Johnson who says overall the gap between rich and poor has “narrowed very slightly."

Big firms likely to shoulder Budget burden

The Mail on Sunday suggests big firms can expect tax hikes that will see them shoulder the burden of George Osborne's “small business Budget”. The Chancellor has said that local authorities will be compensated for their loss of revenue from small firms, but analysis by property consultants including Colliers International has indicated that this could be reaped from other companies. The Sunday Times calculates that Mr Osborne will hit larger companies with £9bn of extra taxes by the end of this parliament in 2020, with the most far-reaching reform identified as a squeeze on the amount of debt-interest payments companies can use to offset their corporation tax bills.

Life gets harder for buy-to-let landlords

David Cox, director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, has added his voice to criticism of higher taxes for landlords. The Chancellor this week unveiled a higher rate of CGT that will apply to gains made on residential property from April 6, 2016. It follows the announcement in the Autumn Statement that higher rates of stamp duty will apply to buy-to-let or second property purchases from April 1, 2016. "The sector has been punitively taxed, with stamp duty on buy-to-let properties, mortgage interest relief and now capital gains tax changes. It's an outright assault on the sector," said Mr Cox.

Higher-rate taxpayers number 4m

The Sunday Telegraph notes that there will be approximately 4m higher-rate taxpayers after the higher-rate threshold is raised to £45,000 - around 1m more than when Labour left office in 2010. The number of higher-rate taxpayers for 2015-16 is estimated to be 4.65m and the increase in the 40% rate, from April 2017, will exclude 585,000 taxpayers from the top bracket.

The Sunday Telegraph, Money, Page: 2

 

Councils should decide on taxes

A cross-party group of MPs and Lords has said local councils should be given more freedom to set their own charges and taxes such as stamp duties as part of a radical overhaul of the way powers are devolved across the UK. The All-Party Political Group (APPG) on Reform, Decentralisation and Devolution argued that devolution has so far been "piecemeal" and suggested “a more coherent and ambitious approach is needed.”

Uber steers clear of tax

The Sunday Times reports that Uber has put together an opaque corporate structure to reduce its tax bill in overseas markets, including Britain. The taxi-hailing service channels most of its revenues from foreign territories via the Netherlands to a sister company registered in the tax haven of Bermuda.

Budget: Crackdown on ‘disguised remuneration schemes’

The FT considers how George Osborne’s decision to shut down disguised remuneration schemes and reclaim unpaid tax from participants will affect users of Employee Benefit Trusts.

REPORTING

 

IA demands end to quarterly reporting

The Investment Association is to announce a series of new demands of FTSE companies as part of a report aimed at reshaping shareholders’ relations with the companies they invest in. The report, covering five key areas: company reporting, investor stewardship, the relationship between owners and companies, capital markets, and the legal and regulatory framework, will ask boards to stop quarterly reporting in a bid to improve focus on long-term strategy. Companies will be asked to comply or explain how quarterly reporting fits into their strategy. A second key request will be for companies to provide detail on long-term capital expenditure plans.

Formation agents fuelling fraud

Attempts by the government to crack down on money laundering and fraud through UK businesses are failing to tackle the key role played by company formation agents, according to a Reuters study. Some formation agents, who typically offer to create new businesses within a day or even a few hours for fees of about £200 or less, fail to perform significant due diligence on who their customers are or why they are buying new companies, according to lawyers. The study says the weaknesses of the system make it vulnerable to abuse. Although formation agents are regulated by HMRC, it does not publish its list of approved agents, so preventing potential customers from easily checking an agent’s status.

FIRMS

 

PwC accused of conflict over DfID work

Diane Abbott, the shadow international development secretary, has accused PwC of "a very serious conflict of interest" in its role as an adviser to the Department for International Development (DfID). Ms Abbott points to the LuxLeaks scandal and PwC’s work for the World Bank for which it produces a report on tax processes in 189 countries. PwC is administering a DfID scheme called the Investment Facility for Utilising UK Specialist Expertise which the government says helps British departments share specialist expertise with developing countries to help "create the conditions for economic growth". Ms Abbott told The Independent: "As the LuxLeaks scandal has shown, PwC is in the business of helping multinational corporations avoid tax. For this reason it is abundantly clear that there is potentially a very serious conflict of interest in DfID paying PwC to administer projects designed to help developing countries raise more tax.” A DfID spokesman denied a conflict of interest while PwC declined to comment.

SMEs

 

SME confidence falls

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) first-quarter survey showed the first decline in job creation by small firms nationwide since mid-2013. The Small Business Index, measuring business prospects over the coming three months, fell to 8.6 in the first quarter from 28.7 a year ago, its lowest since a -5.6 reading in the fourth quarter of 2012. Optimism has fallen in every part of the UK, with a slowing domestic economy, auto-enrolment, the national living wage, the threat of Brexit and quarterly reporting all contributing to the gloom.

PENSIONS   

 

Scrap tax relief and boost the basic state pension to benefit the lowest earners

In a letter to the FT, John Ralfe suggests the £30bn that would be saved by scrapping tax relief on pension saving should be used to boost the basic state pension.

ECONOMY

 

Brexit could cause £100bn short-term shock to the economy

Research from PwC, commissioned by the CBI, has found that the uncertain fate of Britain’s trade relationship in the event of Brexit could knock up to 5% from the country’s GDP and leave Britain close to recession for several years. Even if the UK secures a free trade agreement with Europe after a Brexit, economic growth would be 3% lower than the country’s expected output within the EU by 2020. There would also be a short-term uptick in unemployment from the current rate of 5% to about 8%, the report adds. However, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, accused the CBI and PwC of peddling "scare stories", and said: "Even in the CBI's skewed choice of scenarios for exit, they are forced to admit that employment and the economy will continue to grow after we Vote Leave."

Possible tax probe for 1D

The Sun reveals that boyband One Direction are facing a tax probe over a controversial shares scheme. The band's members have turned their shares in 1D Media into an "alphabet" structure, which although legal could trigger an investigation by HMRC. Tax specialist James Lee said: "HMRC have frowned on alphabet schemes for years because the structure allows money to be manipulated."

The Sun, Page: 11

 

Earnings peak rises

Official statistics show British workers are most likely to reach their "earnings peak" at the age of 38, with the average top income across a lifetime now £26,000. The age at which people reach the height of their lifetime earnings has been steadily rising, from around 29 in the 1970’s to the current level.
