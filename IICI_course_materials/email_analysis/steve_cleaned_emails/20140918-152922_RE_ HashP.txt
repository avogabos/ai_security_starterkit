Dear Steve,

 

Thank you for the answer.

 

Attached hereto notarized reference letter from the bank regarding the
owner.

 

What does in mean 1 personal and 1 bank reference? Please provide further
explanation because usually - reference letter from the bank is enough.

 

Best,

 

Ronny

Dear Ronny

 

 

HASHP Caye Bank application: the one thing missing is the director
reference, they need 1 personal and 1 bank reference.

 

Please arrange notarized and then we can proceed further with bank account.

 

Regarding documents to be signed and stamp by the agent, we have given
clearance to agent to communicate directly with you in order to process your
requirements.

 

I have submitted the refund request to our finance department, they will
process it within 1-2 weeks.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve
