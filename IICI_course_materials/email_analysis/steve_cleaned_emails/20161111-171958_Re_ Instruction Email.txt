Dear Steve,

Thank you for your email.

According to the attached invoices, the annual renewal fee for director privacy service is £25.00. Can you please clarify why you have asked to pay £150.00 instead.

I will send you the required information early next week.

Regards,

Sam

Dear Steve,
Thank you for your email.
I regret to say that I would not be able to pay for the last three years for director record privacy feature for the following reasons:
1. You have not made me aware at any time (unit yesterday) that I need to inform you in advance to cancel this feature otherwise this feature will be added automatically.
2. I can not record that I have ever signed for any automatic renewal of any of your services.
3. You should have noticed that there was an outstanding payment had not been paid and you should made an effort to inform me if there would be any implication if I did not pay the renewal fee (not to wait three years to say so).
However, and as a goodwill gesture, I am willing to pay £150 providing that you confirm immediate cancellation of this feature and this type of miscommunications would not be happening again. Failing to accept this would force to me to cancel all of your services.
Thank you for your understanding,
Regards,
