Subject: Crowd Funding - PayPal/Payment Gateway

Hello Sir,

I am the owner of a game development business based in the UK & India.

We're working on a multi-platform game & we've invested £100,000's. We would like to crowd fund our project to complete our product & we'd like your assistance, our business has been registered in the UK for 3 years & we also have a business bank account in the country. 

How can I go about doing this? I've seen that a few people's PayPal accounts were frozen for using them to crowd fund a project & I don't want any freezes to happen as my campaign is running. Do you provide a payment gateway yourself? Are you also able to provide us with any support to use PayPal's gateway? We are expecting millions (hopefully) to be transacted from our fans -> PayPal -> our bank & we cannot afford any service to be stopped. I can provide any legal information as well as fill out any forms required as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time.

Kindest Regards,
