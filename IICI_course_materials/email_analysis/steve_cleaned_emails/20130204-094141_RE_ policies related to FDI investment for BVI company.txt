Its not a problem,, but it will be a problem for opening a bank account, so
our advice is always the same, incorporate and do bank account as a
consultancy business. Do not mention investment in the business description
as it creates issues - better to get company open and bank account, and then
once the business is actively trading the bank wont care too much what so
long as nothing untoward happens
