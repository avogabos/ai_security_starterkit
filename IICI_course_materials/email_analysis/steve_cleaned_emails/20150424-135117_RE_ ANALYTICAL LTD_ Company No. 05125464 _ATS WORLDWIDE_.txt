Hi Steve,

 

Thank you for your email and explanation of the situation. 

 

During discussions with Delphine I made it very clear that I did not
want my personal address to be used as the registered address for the
company. We we were waiting on confirmation of the registered address from
the provider that I used before the address was to be applied.

 

There were a number of errors made in the registration of the company which I
am very unhappy about, including that I was not even noted as director
until I picked this up recently. Considering that I paid ?2325 for
the company to be set up I need this issue to be resolved asap. On
speaking with Companies House they have advised that there are ways to have
this corrected and to contact you to arrange this. Can you please advise asap?

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Hi
James

 

 

Delphine
is no more working with us so from now on I will be handling your queries.

 

 

Now
regarding the registered address issue, when you ordered the company ANALYTICAL
LTD from us you gave us the registered address as:

 

21E
Westwick Gardens

LONDON

W14
0BU

 

So
it was changed accordingly.

 

 

Now
that you have changed the registered address to following on 15th
Dec 2014:

 

2
PUDDLE DOCK, BLACKFRIARS 

LONDON 

EC4V 3BB

 

So
this address now will be considered as the official address for the company.

 

 

And
as far as Companies House records about previous information on companies,
these cannot change or remove from their records.

 

 

I
hope above information clarifies everything.

 

 

Regards

 

 

Steve

Hi
Delphine,

 

Can you please confirm the status of the address query I sent below?
I really appreciate your help with this.

 

"Thank you for your reply. Both of those addresses are correct,
the company one and my personal one. The problem is that my personal
address is showing on the Companies House records as a registered address
for the company from the 25/11/14 to the 15/12/14. This should not have
been used an official registered address for the company and I don't know why this
was the case. Can you please remove this address as having
been a registered address for the company?"

Hi Delphine,

 

I hope you had a nice Easter.

 

Thank you for back dating the appointment of director also the registered
address at Puddle Dock is correct thank you. 

 

I just wanted to clarify please regarding my personal address showing. This is
actually showing as an official registered address for the company, however it
should never have been used as a registered address for the company, there must
have been some kind of miscommunication at the time of the registration. Is it
possible at all to remove this address from the records as a registered address
for the company. I don't mind it showing on the record as my personal address
that is fine, just not as an official address of the company. Can you please
look to correct the record to remove my personal address as having been an
official registered address of the company?

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Hi
James,

 

The
appointment of the director has been back dated.

 

You
have not purchased our Registered Address Service this is why the following
address shows as the company's registered address as per your instruction at
the time of purchase of the company:

2 PUDDLE
DOCK, BLACKFRIARS 

LONDON 

EC4V 3BB 

 



Regarding your personal address, you have not purchased the Director's Privacy Protection Service that is why your personal address is appearing on the record.

I hope you're having a good day. I've just checked the Companies House
register and it is now showing myself as company director, however
this is showing appointed as todays date. Can you please have
this backdated to when it should have appeared on the 25/11/14? 

 

Also it is still showing my personal address on the records, as well as WWW.BUY-THIS-COMPANY-NAME.COM under
the previous office name. It is imperative that my personal address
is removed as well as the above name. Can you please check this and come

Hi

Thank you for your time earlier. Just to confirm the issues that I am
having with the company are:

 

- It is not showing as having a director on Companies House.

- My personal address is showing on the record for some reason.

- The previous registered address is showing on the record as:

 

WWW.BUY-THIS-COMPANY-NAME.COM 

SUITE B, 29 HARLEY STREET

Where this should only be showing as:

Hi Delphine
and Steve,

 

At the beginning of the year you helped me to finalise the purchase and set up
of the above established company. I have just had someone come
back to me stating that according to Companies House there are no
appointed directors at the moment for the company!? 

 

The other point is that the records also show my personal home address
as having been a registered office, which was stated initially as
this would not occur. Further to this the previous address shows
as being from www.buy-this-company-name.com. This should only show the 29
Harley Street aspect not the company description. Can you please get them to
amend the records immediately to remove my home address as well as this
description!?

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Now
regarding the registered address issue, when you ordered the company ANALYTICAL

So
it was changed accordingly.
Now
that you have changed the registered address to following on 15

So
this address now will be considered as the official address for the company.
And
as far as Companies House records about previous information on companies,
these cannot change or remove from their records.
I
hope above information clarifies everything.

Hi
Delphine,
Thank you for your time earlier. Just to confirm the issues that I am
having with the company are:
- It is not showing as having a director on Companies House.
- My personal address is showing on the record for some reason.
- The previous registered address is showing on the record as:
WWW.BUY-THIS-COMPANY-NAME.COM
SUITE B, 29 HARLEY STREET
LONDON
W1G 9QR
Where this should only be showing as:
SUITE B, 29 HARLEY STREET
LONDON
W1G 9QR
Can you please advise/fix this urgently?
Many thanks,
James

Hi Delphine
and Steve,
At the beginning of the year you helped me to finalise the purchase and set up
of the above established company. I have just had someone come
back to me stating that according to Companies House there are no
appointed directors at the moment for the company!?
The other point is that the records also show my personal home address
as having been a registered office, which was stated initially as
this would not occur. Further to this the previous address shows
as being from
www.buy-this-company-name.com
. This should only show the 29
Harley Street aspect not the company description. Can you please get them to
amend the records immediately to remove my home address as well as this
description!?
Many thanks,
James

Hi
Delphine,
I hope you had a good break..
Thank you very much for these. So just to confirm, I need to sign them and
send them to Companies House for them to lodge? Do I need to provide any
specific instruction for them to complete this?
Kind regards,
James
