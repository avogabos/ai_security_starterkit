The Companies Act 2014 is almost here
Dear Steve,
The 
                              original of this phrase was translated from the 
                              French
Le roi est mort, vive le roi!
, 
                              which was first declared upon the accession to the 
                              French throne of Charles VII after the death of 
                              his father Charles VI in 1422.
In 
                              France, the declaration was traditionally made by 
                              the duc d'Uzès, a senior peer of France, 
                              as soon as the coffin containing the remains of 
                              the previous king descended into the vault of Saint 
                              Denis Basilica. The phrase arose from the law of
le mort saisit le vif
-that the transfer 
                              of sovereignty occurs instantaneously upon the moment 
                              of death of the previous monarch. "The King 
                              is dead" is the announcement of a monarch who 
                              has just died. "Long live The King!" refers 
                              to the heir who immediately succeeds to a throne 
                              upon the death of the preceding monarch.
And 
                              so as June 1st and the commencement of Companies 
                              Act, 2014 rapidly approaches I can't help but feel 
                              that at 1,448 sections and 17 schedules the new 
                              act truly is the 'King' of statutes. (
It already 
                              has the distinction of being the largest piece of 
                              legislation passed in the history of the State
) 
                              But fear not, here in CFI we have prepared the following 
                              resources to assist you in dealing with the new 
                              regime:

                                  and 'DAC' and the steps involved in converting 
                                  from an existing private company to one of these 
                                  new company types, available
