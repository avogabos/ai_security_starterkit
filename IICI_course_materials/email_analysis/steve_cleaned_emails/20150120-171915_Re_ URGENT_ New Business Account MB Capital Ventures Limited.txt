Der Steve,
Kindly find attached:
1. Notarised bank statement recent by lawyer 2. Notarised bank statement 6
months by lawyer 3. notarised passport by lawyer 4. notarised social
security by lawyer (even though you did not request this I did it for
further proof of address)
I will be sending cv and detailed business activity in a separate mail as
this is too big and keeps coming back undelivered
Kindly confirm when you get all of the attached so that I can proceed with
the next e-mail.
Kind regards,
Maria
