Hi Steve, 

Sorry for the late reply. I'm in Australia and lost track of my email for a while. 

So if I want to do the brand name registration, can I register using my personal details? Or do I have to register with the company name? 

Thanks very much! 

Best regards, 
Rachel

Hi
Rachel
Thank
you for your email.
We

Once registered, trademark renewals are required 10

both the above processes, the following information is required:
Company

Registration
     Number
Customer
     ID (if already registered with Formations House)
Trademark
     to be registered
Brief
     description of business activities
Our trademark
service is designed as a low cost service for small business to register
trademarks where there is no likelihood of an objection arising from third
parties. We undertake extensive consultation and discovery before we file a
trademark to minimise the chance of an objection arising. The pre-filing can
last anywhere between 3 to 12 months. The pre filing consultation information
is confidential and we will not reveal it to the trademark applicant. The fact
that we do not reveal this information to the applicant allows us to
communicate freely with other parties and to a reach a decision as to the
efficacy of filing the trademark application.
If after our
pre-filing discovery and consultation phase we decide the trademark is viable
and file the application and subsequently an objection does arise, the
trademark applicant will be will liable for the costs of the party objecting to
the trademark if he loses the case. The cost can run into thousands of pounds.
We will not reveal
the details of the consultation process we undertake before pre-filing or
provide documentation or assistance if an objection arises.
If an objection arises, your options are either to withdraw your application,
before incurring extensive legal costs, or if you wish to employ a lawyer who
can represent you in the case.
Payment can be made
by bank transfer, please use following bank details for payment and email us
the bank transfer receipt once payment is done.
