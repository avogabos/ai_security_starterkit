Dear Mr. Steve,

since now, I would like to change my email address from iadex@libero to
frozenyogurtltd@gmail.com (the one I'm emailing now).

Just one information: I made a payment of 275,00 euro for Company
Protection Service for Frozen Yogurt ltd (order n. 191462 of last
25.10.2016).


Why didn' t you email me back any invoice and is service still not activate
? Can you check the situation ?


Kindest regards
