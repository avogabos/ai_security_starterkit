Dear Oliver, 

 

Following to our phone conversation, I would like to confirm the following: 

I have already made an attempt to register a UK Limited company on your website. My customer id is as follows: 65637013.

On the payment page I have specified that I wish to pay via international wire transfer. Therefore, I will need your bank details with the following information. Please, confirm that I can use the bank details sent to me by Formations House via e-mail for payment? Also, can you, please, clarify whether the provided IBAN GB76ABBY09022210339811 is multicurrency account? 

Once again, I will need to pay for the following services provided by Formations House:

-          Company formation – 50 Pounds

-          Registered address – 25 Pounds

-          Online Company Administrator – 25 Pounds

-          Apostille – 150 Pounds

-          DHL/Fedex/UPS courier fee (if applicable) - ???

-          Advance payment (for future order) – about 250 Pounds (company formation plus express mail courier fee)

In addition, I would like the hard copies of the apostilled company’s set to be shipped out with express mail courier. Is this service included to company’s formation fee? If no, please, quote the shipping fee outside the UK. 

And last but not least, can Formations House issue the Invoice without services specification? In the “service description” section, I would prefer, to be specified as follows: 

Legal and professional charges – 600 Pounds. 

I kindly ask Formations House to issue the aforesaid invoice in EURO and in USD.  

 

Your early reply will be highly appreciated. 

 Regards,

Victoria
