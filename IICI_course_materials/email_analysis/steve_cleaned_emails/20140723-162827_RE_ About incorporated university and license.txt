We can provide an education provider licence, they can operate as an online education provider and later they may setup in the enterprise zone in the Atlantic Institute of Technology campus area which is under construction and will be completed next year.

 

The degree courses are not underwritten by the University of The Gambia, but in future if the courses are solid and delivered to a high standard they can be underwritten by the Institute of Technology once completed.

 

If all courses are delivered virtually, the licence application will be quick and simple. The licence itself is issued by the Commerce Registry of the Enterprise Zone of The Gambia. This means the holder of the licence may trade in the Enterprise Zone or outside of The Gambia, they may not trade in the rest of The Gambia. 

 

You will need a Limited by Guarantee company, with registered address etc and a mailing address in Gambia too (within the enterprise zone). 

We may be able to arrange a bank account anyway but we would need to know the ownership of the company first and intended student market. 

 

To process the licence we will need a 3 year business plan, all director ID and CV’s, and to view the website and course materials being offered along with the exam marking criteria etc.

 

The cost of the licence is £15,000 for the first year and is renewable annually at £10k per annum. If you have all documents in place the licence can be issued within 4 weeks.

Dear Steve,

 

Greeting from Josh Tth is nice to speak to you.

 

About license in Gambia not a bad place serious no matter how in the history is under UK in the past if I am correct.

 

We mainly doing education no other sort of business!

 

Don't need to concern bank account as I think of solution myself.

 

Most important is the authority can issues a education license to operate virtually or later physically in Gambia offering postsecondary course like Degree, Master and Doctorate. 

 

Please advise me the licences and incorporated fee? And the processing time?

 

Thank you,

Josh Tth
