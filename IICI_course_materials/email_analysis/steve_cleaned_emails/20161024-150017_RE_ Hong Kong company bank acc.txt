In other hand, ​at the beginning of

with their accounts open as soon as possible, this is what Oliver wrote to us:
"
Dear

Thank
you for your e-mail
I

And
also the same information that I have asked in my previous e-mail.

Dear
Angela
Please
that Hong Kong company is in process of registration however we are there is
one problem and due to that application is in pending. The Hong Kong registrar
is not accepting special characters in company name and company name by you
have special characters as ‘brackets’ – ‘CONDUCTORES Y CABLES GLOBALES
(CONDUGLOB) LIMITED’. Please confirm how company name should be registered with
special characters?
For
example, company name can be registered as ‘CONDUCTORES Y CABLES GLOBALES
CONDUGLOB LIMITED’.
Waiting
for your confirmation on the company name.
Regards
Steve…

Dear Angela
Again attach is the form which is to be filled by your
Notary Public Office required for BVI company formation.
For notarization documents must be stamp by public notary
in Dominican Republic. Also you need to arrange English translation of these
documents and translation document must also be notarized.
Regarding HONG KONG it is in process but on hold, I was
told by our Support Team that you have been emailed to resend copies of
passports because a single digit of passport number is missing. Please check your
email and other emails

and
julian@marquezsarraff.

if
you received the email from

. Please also check
the SPAM/JUNK section and arrange passport copies as required.
And if required you
can speak to Mr. Shawn or Ms. Rachel in our support team at
