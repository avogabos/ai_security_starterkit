Hi Fahad,

Thank you for the August salary received on 06th September 2016.

I would like to remind you that with August salary i am also expecting the 1st insallment of my bonus which got due in June 2016. And as discussed that last year when I was suppose to get 3 months bonus but got 2 months bonus, therefore in order to compensate, this year i should get 4 months bonus.

Please advice when can you arrange my bonus?

Thank you.

Steve (Talal..)
