Company director is a Syrian national living in Sweden. When order was taken
client asked if there are any special requirements for Syrian nationals to
fulfill to register a Seychelles company. We confirmed that there are no
special requirements for company formation just the usual proof of id and
proof of address and now agents in Seychelles is asking for additional
documents, the message from agent was:

 

'Director is of Syrian Nationality- please note that Syria is considered as
a high risk country. We will require additional KYC documentations as per
compliance requirements. Please be so kind to forward a bank reference and a
professional reference.'

 

In reply client stated that his bank will not provide any such information
for bank reference. But provided a professional reference which was
forwarded to agent in Seychelles. In reply agent said:

 

"A bank reference and a professional reference is a must as per requested by
our compliance and legal department. This is in line to the extra due
diligence required and extra precautions we are requested to have in file by
law."

 

Client cannot fulfill this request and is asking whether we get company
registered or do a refund of GBP 440.

 

 

Please advice.
