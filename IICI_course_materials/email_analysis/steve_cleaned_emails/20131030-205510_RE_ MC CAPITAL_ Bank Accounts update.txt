I sent you 2 emails titled 'MC CAPITAL LIMITED : FBEM BANK' & 'GATEX
LIMITED'

 

Please send me 2 separate emails for these companies MC CAPITAL LIMITED and
GATEX LIMITED and provide me all the details and id docs of each company and
its owner in that separate email.

 

I will then check and will do the necessary arrangements with FBME J

 

 

Thanks

Hi Charlotte/Steve

 

Please find attached the completed bank form from Anthony.

 

Per your previous email I never received a copy of the email Raj.

 

Did this new letter get to him on the 17th?

 

Please let me have an update on this bank account.

 

Regards

Chris

Hi Chris

 

I have replied, but perhaps the emails are not being received.

 

Yes we require the letter for Anthony, and the proof from Aleks. 

 

The Seychelles letter for RBS was still not correct and so im trying again.
Raj is being very helpful but it seems the compliance team keep changing the
requirements. I really do hope I can get this sorted asap.

 

I apologise again for all the time taken, we didn't realise there would be
issues, but it seems since the compliance changes at the bank, this is a
problem for us with other clients too and therefore I am pushing to resolve
as soon as we can.

 

I expect another letter from the Seychelles solicitor tomorrow morning. I
will email to raj straightaway for him to get the compliance team to check.
(I will cc you)

 

Thanks

 

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte/Steve

 

In the absence of any replies to my latest emails, I have to make the
assumption that the only item you are waiting for is a Letter of Good
Standing from Anthony.

 

He will complete this and send to me soon.

 

The bank is also waiting for proof of address from Aleks, who has this in
hand.

 

Is there anything else?

 

I would appreciate a reply as its the only way I know if you need anything.

 

Regards

Chris
