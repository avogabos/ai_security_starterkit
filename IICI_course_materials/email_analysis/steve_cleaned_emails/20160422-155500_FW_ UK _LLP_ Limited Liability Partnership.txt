My personal details are:

*	I am a British Citizen
*	I reside in Portugal, and am subject to income taxes there.

Reading the information you provided, I find that the UK Limited Liability Partnership is the best option for me.

I have the following questions:

*	Am I correct in saying that I will have to declare my income only to the Portuguese authorities. In the LLP structure, in the UK the company and each partner files a return each year. The portion of the partners profit in the LLP is then taxed by their residency, so in this case only your declared income from the LLP is taxed in Portugal. The LLP itself will pay some corporation tax on any profit income that is disclosed as being generated in the UK.
*	Does your company provide a book keeping service? If affirmative, what are the charges? Yes, for an LLP there are a number of setup fees foras each partner must be accounted too, total setup is 1500 for first year and then a renewal fee of 800 per year.
*	You mention that offshore banking is available only in the St. Vincent Islands. I can arrange opening of the necessary accounts independent of your company, in so doing saving me a high fee. Would your company accept this? You are not obliged to use our bank opening services. Please ensure however that you order from us any corporate documents your banking providing requires for the account. Some require legalized documents and others do not as it’s a UK company
*	Would investments in the UK be affected using the UK LLP option. Not directly, if those investments went on to make a profit and the accounts declared the profit then corporation tax isdue on those only.

 

Best regards,

Wilfred Ten-Pow
