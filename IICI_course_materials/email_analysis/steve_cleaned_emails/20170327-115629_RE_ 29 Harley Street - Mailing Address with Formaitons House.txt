Dear Steve

 

Thank you for your emails setting out all that is required for me to use
your services. I am sorry, but I need to clarify some points and it would be
most helpful if you would confirm these points.

 

I have been using a service at 10 Harley street for my mail collection for
over 15 years, but they are no longer providing this service. All I need is
for you to receive my mail and some hand delivery, these will be picked up
by me once or twice a week, the total cost for this would be £225 plus a
setting up fee of £50. I would like to pay by direct debit on a monthly
basis.  Is it really necessary to provide all the information requested as I
am just a one person business winding down to retirement.

 

Regards

 

Stewart
