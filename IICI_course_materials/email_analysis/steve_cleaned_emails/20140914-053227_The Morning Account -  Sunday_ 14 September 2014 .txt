Cameron faces rebellion over devo tax powers
As polls show the referendum on Scottish independence heading for a dead heat David Cameron has promised Scotland complete control of income tax in a new devo max deal. However, writing in the Sunday Times, John Redwood says: “England cannot accept a position where Scotland fixes her own income tax and also sends MPs to Westminster to help set an income tax rate for England too.” Meanwhile, sources close to George Osborne suggest he is looking at plans to stop Scottish MPs voting on finance bills, a move that could prevent a future Labour government from passing its budget measures. Separately, the Mail on Sunday’s Jon Rees interviews Sir Ian Wood on North Sea oil revenues. Sir Ian says that the consensus is that the current 1.45m barrels a day produced by North Sea oil would be reduced to 250,000 by 2050 resulting in virtually no tax revenue particularly as older oil fields need tax breaks to keep them going. Independence could also see thousands of wealthy people living in England Wales and Northern Ireland who have Scottish parents claim non-domicile status, writes Alex Hawkes elsewhere in the paper.

HMRC hitlist looks set to grow
Kyle Caldwell examines the rise in the number of middle-class professionals targeted by HMRC and looks at how the Revenue is identifying its targets using its Connect computer system, said to hold more data than the British Library. Paul Noble, a tax director at Pinsent Masons, said: "The computer is the tax version of Big Brother, because so much personal data is being watched”, while BDO’s Dawn Register comments that publicising the sentences handed out to tax avoiders is a scare tactic used by HMRC to encourage people to pay up without a challenge. Ms Register added that solicitors and barristers could be targeted next. "The Revenue now has access to legal aid data, so if it spots a trend it could well take another look on a much bigger scale," she said.

RTI system under pressure
The Mail on Sunday’s Vicki Owen reminds readers that firms with more than 50 staff have just three weeks to bring their Pay As You Earn submissions up to date to fulfil HMRC’s Real Time Information (RTI) system requirements. Companies are required to file details of payments to staff every time they are made, instead of just once a year, or face penalties of £300 per month. Peter Bickley at ICAEW warned: “It is not going as smoothly as the Revenue would have you believe. It has been badly designed from the beginning and there are fundamental problems.” Denise Love, senior payroll bureau manager at Menzies adds that HMRC should be more visible with the information it is receiving as it can be difficult to prove reports have been sent on time when the system can’t cope. However, a spokeswoman for the Revenue said: “The implementation of RTI has gone very well. More than 99% of PAYE payments are now being reported in real time.”

G20 to impose new tax rules on multinationals
A crackdown on profit shifting to be announced by the OECD this week is expected to force multinational companies to reveal how much tax they pay in each country they operate in. The country-by-country reporting proposals aim to prevent companies shifting profits into tax havens. The OECD is also likely to introduce a test to ensure schemes such as the UK’s Patent Box lead to a genuine increase in innovation.

Alexander Lebedev’s bank raided
Alexander Lebedev’s National Reserve Bank has been raided by Russian authorities who have accused it of evading at least £6.2m in tax. Mr Lebedev believes the move is politically motivated and says the whole sum in dispute has been paid.

Experience VAT cut for a day
More than 15,000 pubs and restaurants are to take part in Tax Equality Day on September 24th which will see hospitality businesses lower their prices by 7.5%, the amount they say would be passed on to customers if VAT were cut from 20 to 5%.

INDUSTRY

Banks hope for fast-track redomicile rules
The Mail on Sunday suggests banking sources are confident the Treasury would initiate fast-track rules for banks moving south of the border in the event of a Yes vote. They currently require a period of consultation sandwiched between two court hearings which could take a total of up to 18 months. Experts also suggest the costs involved would be higher than expected with the extra work of redefining contracts under English law running to billions for the financial sector. Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, TSB, Tesco Bank and Clydesdale have all said they will relocate.
The Mail on Sunday, Page: 87

Yes vote could see RBS face pensions crisis
Royal Bank of Scotland could face a £5.6bn funding shortfall in its pension scheme following a Yes vote as pension schemes with members in both Scotland and the rest of the UK could be deemed “cross border” requiring them to be fully funded at all times. BP and Lloyds Banking Group, would also be affected, with a black hole of about £100bn opening up in the UK’s corporate retirement plans, according to analysis by the investment bank Credit Suisse.

Lehman insolvency could earn PwC £1bn
Geoff Ho reports on the latest creditors report on the collapse of Lehman Brothers, noting that PwC has made over £850m from acting as administrator to the bank - the most lucrative in UK corporate history - and a figure that could rise to £1bn by the time Lehman’s is finally wound up, according to insolvency experts. PwC has managed to secure all the money owed to Lehman's creditors.

Expert advice
Jon Dawson, partner at Kingston Smith, advises a reader on, whether as one of three directors of a company, he can lend money to the company via a personal loan and whether the company can pay him interest and if he will be taxed on it.

SMEs

Home Business Initiative launched
Enterprise minister Matthew Hancock has launched a scheme aimed at making it easier to run businesses from home. The Home Business Initiative scraps the requirement for planning permission to run a home-based business and business rates for the majority of home-based firms. Kate Schmit, partner at Stevens & Bolton, said: “The initiative will be useful as it clarifies the rules and will help to reduce the amount of red tape involved in running a home business.”
The Sunday Times, Money, Page: 6<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/money/Consumer/article1458292.ece>

SMEs stalling over independence fears
While examining the potential fallout of a Yes vote in Scotland, the Sunday Times notes that SMEs are seeing deals fall through and hiring plans put on hold over fears of protracted independence negotiations. Businesses are chiefly worried about what tax regime would follow Scotland's exit from the Union, the paper says, with many sceptical that Alex Salmond can deliver on promises of a 3% corporation tax cut with the country currently running a deficit of 8.3% of GDP.
The Sunday Times, Business, Page: 5<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Economy/article1458533.ece>

Alternative finance awareness growing
Research conducted by supply chain finance firm Platform Black has revealed that just one in ten UK SMEs believe the services that the major banks offer are better than those of the new 'challenger' banks. Platform Black's co-founder Louise Beaumont said: “The big four may still control 85% of small and medium-sized enterprise accounts, and 90% of lending, but awareness of what challenger banks and providers of alternative business finance offer is growing rapidly.”
The Mail on Sunday, Business, Page: 92

Ofcom boost to micro-businesses
New telecoms contract rules have come into force applying to businesses with up to 10 staff which make it easier for them to switch deals. Ofcom has ruled that businesses must now be given precise information about potential charges and early termination penalties and are no longer required to contact their existing provider in order to leave.
Sunday Express, Financial, Page: 8

Offline legwork required before online pitch
Kiki Loizou explores the difficulties of raising cash through online crowdfunding sites and notes that, to gain interest from investors, small businesses need to formulate a good marketing plan before pitching online and should demonstrate interest in the plan by having raised 10%-20% of the required funds from friends and family first. Ms Loizou reminds readers that 30% of pitches on Crowdcube don’t make their target while on Seedrs the number rises to two-thirds. Jeff Lynn, who started Seedrs in 2009, said: “If you expect to post your pitch and have people throw money at it, you’re in for a nasty surprise.”
The Sunday Times<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/small_business/article1458450.ece>

SMEs taking on more staff
The latest research from the Federation of Small Businesses has found that 5% of SMEs increased headcounts in the third quarter with the figure expected to rise to 7% over the next three months.

ECONOMY

New pension rules could boost economy
Hymans Robertson predicts the UK economy will receive a £3bn boost next spring when over-55s will be allowed to cash in their pension savings. The study suggests that in the first quarter of 2015-16, £3bn of the extra £4bn-£5bn that will be withdrawn from funds will boost Britain's gross domestic product by 0.6 percentage points for the rest of 2015. This could inflate the forecast for GDP growth next year from 2.3% to 2.9%.

Matlock: Go easy on artists’ big pay days
Donna Ferguson interviews former Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock in the Sunday Telegraph. Mr Matlock recounts his run-ins with the taxman and recalls how his accountant told him on the way to a meeting with HMRC: "Be very careful what you say, Glen. These people are worse than the Gestapo." Mr Matlock also suggests HMRC should change tax rules to allow artists to spread “one good payday” out so the tax doesn't all fall in one year.
