We would like to close the company TSE ltd.

So the company has to prepare/file:

1) VAT final return
2) VAT de-register/filling form VAT 7
3) Preparing/filling companies house*___final_* statutory accounts and 
HMRC Company Tax return

Please let me know which information, initial docs you  need for 
preparing reports mentioned above?Also please clarify when company's 
bank accounts should be closed? Before filling accounts ?
