Do you need a company registered before Christmas?
Dear Steve,
Last year saw a number of postive news reports, articles 
                              and publications in relation to the Irish economy 
                              which resulted in a lot of positivity on what the 
                              future may hold...
...and it seems like that positivity was well warranted!
The tourism sector brought in record profits while insolvency 
                              rates fell to a level not seen since 2009.
Improved trading conditions also encouraged entrepreneurship 
                              and start-ups with almost 18,000 new companies being 
                              incorporated - a 7 year high.
At CFI we have been assisting everyone from sole traders 
                              to accountants, to lawyers, to tax consultants with 
                              every aspect of their company secretarial needs 
                              for over 25 years. These include, but are not limited 
                              to:

In addition to that, we're also available to assist 
                              with the new Companies Act legislation which was 
                              recently passed.
Companies 
                              Act 2014:
The 
                                long awaited Companies Act 2014 was finally signed 
                                into law by President Higgins on 23rd December 
                                2014. This new Companies Act will replace the 
                                Companies Acts 1963-2013. However, It has not 
                                been 'commenced' yet and companies continue to 
                                operate under the Companies Acts 1963-2013. The 
                                general consensus is that the Act will be commenced 
                                in or around June 2015.
Between 
                                now and then, we will be looking at the parts 
                                of this Act which will affect our clients most, 
                                on a day to day basis, and offering guidance and 
                                advice. If you have any particular questions at 
                                the moment, I would love to hear them as my intention 
                                is to compile a comprehensive 'F.A.Q' sheet and 
                                then share it with all our clients. Simply email 
                                me on
sean@formations.ie
My guarantee to you for 2015 is that myself and my highly 
                            trained and expert colleagues will be on hand to go 
                            that extra mile for you to ensure you get the service 
                            and support you need for whatever project you undertake.
