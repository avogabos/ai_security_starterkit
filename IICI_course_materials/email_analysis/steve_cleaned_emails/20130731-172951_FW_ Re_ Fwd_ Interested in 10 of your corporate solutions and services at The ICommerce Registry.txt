I have answered them as much as possible but, it seems you have confused him somehow. You need to speak to hm personally and explain he is an agent of the registry- if he is an end user then he must go through an approved agent such as formations house.

 

The £400 I have no idea what hat price is for or where you got it

 

Hi 1. What is the difference between Gambia GBC2 & GBC1?, A GBC1 is tax resident in The Gambia, and therefore is not required to declare income in countries where it trades. A GBC2 is an IBC company much like a Seychelles company, it is registered in Gambia and is not required to pay taxes to gambia however is should declare income in the countries where worldwide taxation exists and pay taxes accordingly.

2. What do I require to have a PLC registered?

·        Must state that it is a Public Limited Company in its Memorandum and its name must be suffixed with “PLC”.

·        Must have a minimum authorised share capital of $50,000

·        A Minimum of 25% of the shares allotted must be paid up prior to the commencing trade

·        Must have at least two members and at least two company directors (maybe Corporate entities). 

·        A company secretary must be appointed who has the knowledge and ability to fulfil the necessary functions

·        A PLC is required to deliver its accounts to the Registry within 6 months after the end of each accounting period.


3. Is the banking license referred to, a license for a regular commercial bank where I can directly use the word 'BANK' as part of my bank's name, or is it just a license for financial services provider company?

It is for a company providing Bank related activities, there are separate licences for financial services

4. Is the banking license only applicable to only Gambia or are there other countries for which you also issue banking license like this? We only offer licencing in Gambia

5. The price for merchant account on the price list says �140, but in youremail you stated �400. Can you please reconcile this discrepancy? (I don’t know what you sent him)

6. How long does the patent application process take to be completed? 30 days typically if there are no issues, 3 months is maximum for a response

7. Your website says company formation takes 5 minutes, but stated 48hours. Am I missing something here? (I don’t know what he is seeing) which website did he see – its 30 seconds to incorporate and a few mins fo the docs

8. I am not sure about what youmeant by "merchant account and online merchant processing can be setup within 15 working days and all the licensing process can take maximum 4 months"

I am confused by what you mean by '4 months'. Is it a non-existent service to require 4 months processing? I don't want to pay for a non-existent service.

My question is, if I order the service today, exactly HOW MANY DAYS will it take for the merchant account to get fully set up and integrated with a payment gateway so that I can begin to accept payment on my website usingthe merchant account? I don’t know what he means – this sound slike you have confused 2 products together, 

9. Don't you have online payment processor to accept credit card payment with, since I have visa debit card and MasterCard debit card that I can pay with, instead of bank transfer method that might take several days for payment to be confirmed?

For icommerce registry ? I don’t understand the issue here. If he is becoming an agent to sell gambia, then he has a credit account or may pay by bacs 

 


10. Why does it take 15 days for payment through my merchant account tobe transferred to my bank account? This is where you are using our merchant account with our discount rate – we hold the money for security purposes as per our AML certificate

I thought it is a merchant account that would be directly linked to my checking account? You may apply for a merchant account with your own bank account however you need to be aware that it is unlikely you will receive the same discount rate.

I didn't like the idea of some third party credit card processor like 2co stating that it will take one week before they release funds from sales on my website. 

Hence, I decided that it would better to have my own merchant account, which under normal circumstance, should have funds deposited in my checkingaccount within 2-3 days maximum. 

So, I don't understand why this merchant account should take 15 days for funds from my sales to take 15 days to get transferred to my account.

11. Since Abidjan is very close to Gambia, I might want to pay a visit one of these days for a sight seeing of "The Global Enterprise Zone "Is it acceptable?
sure, it is being developed as we speak, there is little to see right now as all building foundations are being laid hwoever within 3 months there will be plenty to see

Thanks for your prompt response

Hello Steve,

I just spoke to you on the phone, regarding theemail I sent to your support email yesterday.
=========================================================

 

I came across your website today and find your services very innovative and most relevant to my business needs.�

 

I wasplanning to travel out to Singapore or Hong Kong later this year, just to get the kind of services you offer.�

 

But with this discovery, I am inclined to change my travel plans, and if possible make Gambia my next travel destination and residence due to the proximity of Gambia to my current country of residence.

 

I am interested in the following services:

 

1. GBC2 Offshore Company

2. Bank Account Opening

3. Merchant Account

4. Virtual Offices

5. Limited liability company

6. Banking license

7.Brokerage license

8. Insurance license

9. PLC company formation

10. Trust company

 

QUESTIONS

 

1. What are the prices for each of the above services.

 

2. How do I pay for the services? Do I pay with credit card or what is the mode of payment that you accept?

 

3. How quickly will each of these services be set up for me after payment?

 

4. Is the virtual office service only Gambia-based or are there options for virtual offices in other countries like the US ,UK , EUROPE etc

 

5. Can the merchant account be used to process credit card payments online, for worldwide transactions?

 

6. When funds are deposited into my bank account, can I request my funds to be wired from my bank account to any bank in any other country?

 

7. How many days does it take for credit card payments processed using the merchant account to get credited to my bank account andavailable for withdrawal?

 

8. What is the rate charge on the merchant account processing?

 

9. Are there any restrictions as to the type of businesses that can use the merchant account? In other words, can the merchant account be used to process payments for a barter exchange type of business or business opportunity type of product/service?

 

10. Does the bank account come with internationaldebitcards like Visa card, MasterCard for withdrawal of funds in account?

 

11. Do I have to physically travel down to Gambia to subscribe to these services, and sign for documents orservices can be paid for online and delivered online only?

 

 

 

Please check your sign upform because I thing something must be wrong with it.�

 

I tried to sign up several times and form kept telling me invalid data entered. I changed my data several times and thesame error messages kept coming up.�

 

Let me have a response to the above questions to enableme plan accordingly.

 

Thanks and best regards,

 

Godwin King
