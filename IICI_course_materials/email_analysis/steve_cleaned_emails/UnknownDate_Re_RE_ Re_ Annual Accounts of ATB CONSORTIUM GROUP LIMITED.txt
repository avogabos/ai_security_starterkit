Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
We have received the activation pin code and have successfully enrolled your company for Corporation Tax Online services. However, in your HMRC\u2019s online account, we have noticed that the status of your company is dormant with HMRC, due to which we cannot submit the Corporation Tax Return. We have sent a fax to HMRC regarding the same and will update you as soon as we will receive a response from HMRC.
Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.
Regards,
Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
