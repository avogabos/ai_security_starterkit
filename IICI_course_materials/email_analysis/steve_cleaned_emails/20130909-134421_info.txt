Dear Steve,

as I told you by phone, I would like to change my company adress to your 
office.

Details: Cotton Trading International Ltd

Actual Registered office: 16, Dover Street

Company n : 5666820

VAT: 892384975

We have just closed our balance 30 June 2013.



I inform you that our turn over is  small.

Please let me know all steps necessary to register my company in your 
office.

Please note: Actually, I'm not the director, but with the new registered 
address, I would like to be director.

Awaiting your early reply,



Best regards

Massimo Burdo
