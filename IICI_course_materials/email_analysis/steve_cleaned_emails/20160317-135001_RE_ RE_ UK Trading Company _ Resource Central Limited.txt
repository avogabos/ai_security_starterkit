I think you should remind him firstly our site is live with companies house, and we have been operating from Harley street for 14 yrs

There are a number of companies using Harley Street for trading and Registered Office, the standard Registered Office address we provide is Suite B, and as we have registered more than 200,000 UK companies and more internationally, this address is common as we are a large formation agent in the UK under Companies House and HMRC

We have no control over people who say they are based here but are not.

At no time in the email does in appear you are discussing Formationshouse.com.

We have no connection to any CEO in Belgium, neither do we operate a Twitter account

Our number 020 72552557 has been active for many years abd if you research the whois record for Formationshouse you will see it has been registered for many years.

The companies we sell can be viewed on Companies House at any time for verification.

 

We believe whatever research you may have conducted, has been conducted on the wrong company and in the wrong way.

You would be able to visit our office in Harley Street at any time to verify we are based there.

We do not work with Brokers

We have resellers who purchase from us on behalf of their customers but they do not trade as Formations House

If a third party has contacted you I suggest you do not work with them, and do not try and connect their details with ours.

hello

 

this  choqued  me   ...i can t  beleive  FORMATION HOUSE   is  a scam


29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR


Hi,

It took a bit of research, but please do not conduct business with anyone offering the following address:

29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR

In this instance, we were contacted about a brokerage service (a middle man) for elite sales. The guy said he tried calling, but couldn't get through (RED FLAG -- he doesn't want a phone record).

I looked at his email address, which was a website extension. I visited the website. It was a flair of words but still vague, and no contact info listed anywhere. Only a form for YOU to fill out.

I searched the company name online. I found a lot of webpages with company references, but all were again vague and nothing solid from our industry.

I found the CEO on Twitter. A Belgian guy living in Spain 10 years and is A WEBSITE MAKER. Not anyone from our specific industry. He said "business" was thriving. That Twitter profile disappeared within the last 24 hours, but he's still on LinkedIn. 

So I emailed the associate back, asking for a land line phone number and a physical address. He only gave his cell +34673872084.

The address he offered was 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR.

So then I researched the address, which is flagged online for fraud and money laundering, and associated with a long line of business names. There are way too many businesses stemming from that address location, and even the same Suite number.

What a riot, to throw so many websites on the internet. And as web developers, they have the capability to create a batch of web pages to make it appear as if their "business" has been around a while.

BOTTOM LINE -- NO MIDDLE MEN FOR ANYTHING. Notice I didn't name the business. Because by in no time they'll be operating under another business
