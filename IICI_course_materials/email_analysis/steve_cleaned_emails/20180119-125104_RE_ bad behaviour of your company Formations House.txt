Dear Mr Puddo,

 

This is the incorrect email to send for the service enquiry. I am replying however as I do wish to ensure we resolve the problems.

I have checked the order and our email system and see that we have sent you a number of emails since the order to request ID documents.

We are unable to process any order without the identity documents of the new owner.

 

Our phone lines are all active and we are receiving calls from all our other customers, and for those we provide virtual office services.

 

Steve is a valued employee of ours and I can check all his emails myself and see he did send you more than one email to request the ID documents.

Our site also clearly states in the terms and conditions that we will not process any order until ID documents are received.

 

Again I ask you to send your identity documents to us, please send them to myself at charlotte@formations.house <mailto:charlotte@formations.house>  and I can personally manage the change of owner.

 

In addition you may also note we have a prominent office in Harley Place, and although we prefer customers to arrange in advance a time to see us, we are actually present Monday to Friday 9.30 to 5pm, as our virtual office customers routinely drop by to collect their mail.

 

I look forward to receiving the documents from you as requested.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar

Subject: bad behaviour of your company Formations House

 

Hello, 

just one month ago I bought a company named Focus Revolution on your website. The Company was promote as "off the shelf". 

After a lot of emails sent just the pass week contact me Mr Steve Smith and told me that needed some documents. He declared that he sent me an email just on december but I never received it. 

No problem for the extreme dealy but I want the company asap. If you are not able to do this, please refund immediately the amount payd. 

In the last two days I sent a lot of email to Mr "Smith" without reply so I am very disappointed. The change of ownership is a very simple procedure. 

 

If I don't any reply in the next 24 hours I'll go to the police office.

 

Best Regards

 

Mauro Puddu
