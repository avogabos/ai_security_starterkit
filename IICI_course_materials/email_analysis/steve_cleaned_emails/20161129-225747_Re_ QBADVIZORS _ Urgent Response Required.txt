Dear Yaseen
As per due diligence regulations
country India is one of the high risk countries therefore we can only accept
passport as Proof of Identity.
We can wait on application till you
get renewed passport or you can appoint any other person having valid documents
as director and shareholder in the company and later change it. Please note
that person appointed at the time of registration, after removing that person
his/her information will always remain in company documents.
Please advice how you wish to
proceed.
