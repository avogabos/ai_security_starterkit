Dear Ajay,

 

I mentioned after you had pushed me several times that I knew not of a way
to appoint you as a corporate director unless you wished me to incorporate
another Ltd first to which you said no. I mentioned that perhaps Companies
House meant as a Sole Trader however I also said that as there is no company
registration number on this I could not see how it is done unless it can be
done later/ afterwards. There is a way that perhaps the accountants you
spoke to meant, which is where the Sole Trader is shown as registered
outside of the EU, as then no company registration number is needed, but as
I said to you several times, if you want to do it this way firstly I need to
know where the sole trader would be (and you told me not to use Ghana) and
that it will be very hard to open a bank account in the UK for the company
if one of the directors is a Sole Trader outside of EU and you have no
documented registration for it. (please do  try and recall my advice on the
bank account opening that I mentioned in every conversation we had).

 

The company is registered, I have said this before. It is registered on a
fast service as you wanted the company number for the bank, and you agreed
that as its possible to amend the company register at any time I could
proceed.

 

You are the Director and Company Secretary,  as requested. You have the
share certificate in PDF form, you can print and sign this. There are no
official share certificates from companies house. The Certificate of
Incorporation original has been posted to the address in Harrow. 

 

If you have the details of who has given you the advice about corporate
directors as an individual please tell me, as I would like to ask how it is
they would suggest adding it. Companies House have confirmed it is not
possible unless you are a Ltd or PLC  etc. You were specific to me in not
wanting this, but perhaps you were not specific to the other people you
spoke to.

 

You can ask any accountant to contact us and take over the company admin,
and they can then change details, or use our Companies House approved
software to file changes. The Ltd incorporation service is a simple service
usually provided entirely online. We have delivered the company
incorporation to the law and regulations of Companies House and we can only
make amendments as these company laws allow us. I have tried as much as
possible to assist in having the company formed as you would like, and we
have not charged you extra for all the consultancy we have to date provided,
including the original consultancy regarding offshore structures.

 

If you provide me the names of who you have spoken to I shall see what can
be done, however I cannot do something at Companies House which cannot be
done just because you wish it to be this way. I will continue to attempt to
resolve any issues but resolutions are limited by Law.

 

Kind Regards

 

Charlotte Pawar

Dear Charlotte,

 

I will need to sign the Share Certificate.

 

I recall you specifically agreeing register me as The Corporate Director,
Director and Secretary.

 

I recall mentioning to you that I had spoken with a person at companies
house and other business colleges and accountants. 

 

Please call me back.

Dear Ajay

 

Directors are not required to sign anything when appointed. Once the shares
are issued you may wish to sign the Share Certificates if required. You may
be asked to sign resolutions when any changes are made to the company that
cannot be implemented online.

 

I put you as both Secretary and Director. Sole Proprietors in the UK do not
have a corporate registration number and as the sole director you fulfil the
role of both types of directors. A true Corporate Director in the UK is
always an actual company with a registration number such as an LTD. I did
mentioned to you that you could incorporate Ajay Valecha Ltd to use as this
corporate. The other option would be to have a Sole Proprietor that is not
listed as located in the EU, and then no registration number is needed.
However if you did this prior to opening the UK bank account, the bank will
want to see proof of the sole proprietorship outside of the EU and documents
would need to be issued from that country making the process long winded. At
any time can additional directors be added, and the secretary updated.

 

The Bank will require only the registration number as they will do their own
checks at companies house.

 

Please let me know what questions or requirements you may wish for the LLP
so I can let you know any rules in this regard.

 

Kind Regards

Charlotte

Dear Charlotte,

 

Some burning Questions:

 

How and When do I sign on the registration as Corporate Director, Director
and Secretary?

 

Was it Director or Secretary that you put as Sole Proprietorship?

Can you please give details of the Sole Proprietorship Filing?

 

Can I pass over the registration number of the filing to the Bank that I
want to open up the account with? 

 

Please help so that I can use the time allocated by you to move swiftly on
with the LLP registration. 

 

Thank you. Thank You.

Dear Ajay,

 

I have several meetings today and am not available.  The registration is
complete and I provided the company documents to you.

 

Once you have the new Articles of Association drafted with your solicitor
either he can file them or you can provide to us and we will submit them to
companies house.

 

The LLP is more straightforward as there are no shares and 2 partners  May
I go ahead and incorporate this? Please be aware it will also be registered
at Companies House Cardiff, as the London office of Companies House does not
hold the register and is only an admin office for same day services.

 

You can add shares etc at any point from now onwards, but be aware you may
find it easier to open the account for the LTD first before issuing any new
shares.

 

Kind regards

 

Charlotte

Dear Charlotte,

 

The share structure will do for now. 

 

I will provide more clarity as suggested once this registration is complete.


 

How do I proceed further with the current registration.

The companies house system does not allow for share value at less than a
penny, and as you were clear on paying up £3000 in shares, this equates to
300,000 shares, otherwise you will need to either pay up £30,000 for all
shares, or leave some shares issued but not paid up (which is possible as
they can be given to you as the director).

 

I can do this very easily if this is how you wish to proceed.

 

We cannot cancel a filing, as the registration is issued. You may adopt a
new set of articles and enter these at companies house with a resolution.
The set we use is standard for Companies House (not just our formations
house, but other too). A solicitor can draw up something more precise but at
no time previously did you state you wished to have a difference set of
articles and it is not common for us to ask as most clients are aware prior
to formation what they want.

 

We can remove a company from a register, however this will cost £75 for us
to this. Then you may reregister if you wish, bearing in mind some facts
regarding the structure will not have changed as these are rules.

 

You came to us to request various information about offshore incorporation
options of which we supplied. You then came again to incorporate a UK
company which is a standard product governed by UK incorporation rules. I
believe you may have had some misunderstanding of the UK incorporation rules
and therefore some of the requirements you initially asked for could not be
met.

 

I am happy to assist in correcting any problems, but you will need to be
clear on what is allowable and what isnt in a UK structure, and in addition
how the banks in the UK will view certain things in the structures which
could easily be amended after the bank have opened the account.

Hi Charlotte.

 

I may have not forgotten.

 

You mentioned after the conversation that you could fit a maximum initially
of Three Million Shares in the application. You haven't done so. 

 

Please change it to the Three Million Shares and please assist to re-issue
to Three Hundred Billion Shares as you have advised. 

 

As for the blissful ignorance concerning Companies House being unmovable
from Cardiff, I do apologise and thank for the clarification. :)

 

I will not be able to accept this registration with the stated structure. 

 

Please advise how you will proceed.

OK, I think you must have forgotten the conversation we had and agreed,
300tr will not fit on the form, therefore you said use the maximum number
allowed, and that all would be issued at a total value of £3000. Hence why
it is done in this specific way. As also mentioned, and agreed, once
incorporated and the account open, you may then increase the total share
capital.

 

Companies House is in Cardiff, we cant move it! Your company registered
