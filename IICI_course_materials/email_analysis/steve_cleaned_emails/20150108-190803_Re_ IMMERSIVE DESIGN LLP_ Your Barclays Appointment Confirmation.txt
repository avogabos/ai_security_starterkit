Having looked through my records of we were only charged for 2 express
Apostille certificates.

We have not received the LLP one, but we'd rather now have an
Apostille certificate
for the  Dalton Pascal Limited Seychelles, so cancel the apostille for the
LLP which has not been delivered and provide us with an Apostille certificate
for the  Dalton Pascal Limited Seychelles instead.

With this certificate we may be more likely to open a bank account

Will you be sending all the required company documents in
advance to barclays (original incorporation certificates etc)?
We tried to setup a bank at metro bank, and they were unable
to setup a bank account with the given business structure you have sold us. If
this turns out to be the same case with Barclays and they are unable to open a
bank account with this business structure I will require a full refund.
