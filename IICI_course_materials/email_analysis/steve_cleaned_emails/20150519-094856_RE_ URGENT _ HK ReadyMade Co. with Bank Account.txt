We will need his id docs, and the payment today for us to then do the
director appointment etc and get the apostile ordered, as its quite a tight
deadline. The customer will then go and collect the documents from our
notary and then he can go to the bank.

 

We would ideally also need him to come into the office today to sign the
appointment document.
