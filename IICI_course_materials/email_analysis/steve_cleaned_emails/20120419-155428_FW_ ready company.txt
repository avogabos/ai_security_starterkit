some. So we are interested in ready made one. So we seek company we will own
if you can provide adress and insurance and the taxes service you were tol
dme you having some packages for that.

 

I have two ppls they like to be representative (as directors or director and
secretary  depend what is need or suits better to law ) our wish is to be
able operate the company next week. I need to know how we do to achieve
that, what is the fastest way to do it. Or i fly to UK or i mail you the

therein London and will try to call you, but honestlly my english isnt the
best so that is why i write anyway. If its impossiblle, ill come personally.
