Dear Eric Gilly

None of our clients ever paid VAT for products and services purchased from
www.formationshouse.com because before, our accounting was outsourced
therefore www.formationshouse.com was not liable to charge VAT to their
clients. But now our accounting is done locally in UK therefore from now on
all our clients will be charged VAT for any products or services purhcased.

Reason you cannot see the VAT amount on your auto-generated invoice is
because our system is being updated to integrate VAT calculation for all
invoices, soon system will be able to produce VAT invoices but for now we
have to collect VAT manually. We thank you for your understanding and
co-operation.

Regards
