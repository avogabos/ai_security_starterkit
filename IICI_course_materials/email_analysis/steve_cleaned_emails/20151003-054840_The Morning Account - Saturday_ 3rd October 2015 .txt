HMRC’s digital vision
Adam Palin provides a detailed examination of HMRC’s digital plans in the FT. The ultimate goal of George Osborne’s drive to simplify the tax system is personalised online tax accounts for all individuals and companies, says Palin. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the ACCA says: “If it’s done well, it should be really quite advantageous for taxpayers as well as HMRC” while the ICAEW’s Paul Aplin adds that greater pre-population of self-assessment returns is a “very good use of technology.” The piece goes on to look at trust issues with a digital system; the fact that 82% of people still preferred to communicate with HMRC by phone; continued underlying complexity of the tax system and the success of HMRC’s Connect system which, since 2010, has generated over £3bn in extra tax receipts through identifying underpayments.

VW drivers won’t be made to pay more road tax
The Government has promised that VW owners whose vehicles were fitted with illegal defeat devices will not have to pay higher taxes to reflect the extra pollution their car causes. The Guardian cites Baker Tilly as saying HMRC had been "cheated" out of revenue by the VW scandal because of the tax breaks diesel cars enjoy.

Apprenticeship levy carries risks
Business investment in training will be harmed by an apprenticeship levy, writes the Telegraph’s Allister Heath, citing one firm which told the CBI it spent £20m on training and £3m on apprenticeships. A levy would cost it £45m. The consequences would be detrimental to staff who, rather than shareholders, would pick up the bill, the firm said. Mr Heath says the Government should be grateful for efforts by the Big Four to recruit ever more school-leavers.

Zucman reveals world of tax havens
Vanessa Houlder reviews Gabriel Zucman’s The Hidden Wealth of Nations which details the global web of tax havens he claims hold almost a tenth of the world’s financial wealth. He uses new methods to chart the offshore world and points to what he calls a “sinister trio” of tax havens - the British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg and Switzerland – and estimates a total of $7.6tn is held offshore. He reckons 80% of assets are undeclared and governments are missing out on $200bn in taxes.

Research shows six kinds of CFO
A new global survey from Epicor Software Corporation has shown that how and why CFOs support their business operations through technology investments can vary according to their style of leadership. The research provides insight into the working and leadership styles of more than 1,500 CFOs worldwide, separating them into six distinctive groups: Politicians, Revolutionaries, Carers, Conductors, Traditionalists and Visionaries. Dr. Dimitrios Tsivrikos, of the Division of Psychology and Language Sciences at University College London, says the research makes it possible “to link the leadership style of business leaders to business growth, profit and change”.

How best to secure an equity partnership role?
Sharron Gunn, executive director at the ICAEW, considers how best to become an equity partner, claiming that "ambition will set you apart from your colleagues but you will need to plan ahead". Ms Gunn suggests thinking about how you will help a company excel, knowing your strengths and weaknesses, skills in winning new business and the professional management of internal relationships will each be key to success.

Sports Direct accused of using intimidation tactics
Sports Direct has been accused of intimidating the owner of Direct Golf after it ordered the locks to be changed on the firm’s HQ and filed wind-up proceedings, hours after Direct Golf founder John Andrew had filed a notice of administration, appointing Begbies Traynor.

The lure of the robo-adviser
Mark Atherton compares robo-advisers with traditional advisers in the Times. Nutmeg, True Potential are reviewed along with players offering human beings on hand where needed. These are Wealth Horizon, Tilney Bestinvest and Fidelity.

Elite educators will remain primary supply of City talent
The FT’s Emily Cadman examines moves by the Big Four to eliminate recruitment bias and expresses her cynicism that class distinctions are going to be miraculously swept away in the City. Although giving a wider spectrum of people an opportunity is good, she thinks elite schools and universities will continue their dominance of providing talent for elite jobs.

PENSIONS

FCA seeks to protect savers from risky investments
The Financial Conduct Authority is to alter the criteria for “certified high net worth investors” and “restricted investors” amid fears ordinary savers are being tempted to withdraw their entire pension fund to invest in risky investments intended for sophisticated, wealthier investors. Possible changes include making lump-sum pension withdrawals “expressly excluded” from what counts as income for the high net worth test.

And these, he adds, should be long-term, rather than reactions heavily influenced by short-term economic indicators.

Isle of Man enjoying growth three times that of Britain
The Economist profiles the Isle of Man economy, noting that over the past 30 years the island has enjoyed growth three times as fast as Britain’s.

The top rate of income tax is 20% and the standard corporate-tax rate is 0%.

Auditor general issues warning to Holyrood
Scotland’s auditor general, Caroline Gardner, has warned the Scottish government that it is failing to provide a full picture of spending, borrowing and pension liabilities, something increasingly important as new powers are devolved. She said: “In the absence of easily accessible, aggregate information on what the devolved Scottish public sector owns and owes overall, it is difficult for the Scottish parliament, taxpayers and others to get a full picture and understanding about public spending and the longer-term implications for public finances.” Ms Gardner also warned that delays to an IT programme related to CAP payments could result in the EU blocking funds, which it has already done with structural fund payments due to separate accounting failures.
