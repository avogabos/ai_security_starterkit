Dear Steve,

in august 2013 we have paid for a bank account and up till now nothing is
done.
This is an issue that we have to solve very urgently now because we want to
work with Intellia Commodities II LTD and receive the commissions in our
UK/London account.

Can You guide me to that solution here?

If not pôssoble we will be obliged to buy a shelf company with bank account
included

Will call You this afternoon to talk about this isssue.

kind regards,


Ponjaert, Jean Pierre
Intellia Commodities II LTD.
