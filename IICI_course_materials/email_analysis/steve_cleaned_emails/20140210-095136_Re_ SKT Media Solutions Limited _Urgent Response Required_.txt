Hi Rebecca / Steve

I filled in all the paperwork, and sent you 2 proofs of address, a copy of my passport, and the original reference letter I got from my bank

They were signed for at your offices last Thursday - attached is proof of delivery

Please can you let me know you have received these documents, and that they are all in order

Thanks
