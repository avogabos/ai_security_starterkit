High stamp duty hitting sales of London’s top property
According to Knight Frank data, based on the first seven months of the year, the high stamp duty levied on sales of the most expensive London homes is impeding the market. The number of transactions for homes worth more than £1.3m is down 19% compared with a year earlier, and for property worth more than £3.3m the drop is 25%. "Fears of a Labour mansion tax had deterred buyers before May’s election, but the market had not rebounded once the Conservatives won because of higher stamp duty," said Liam Bailey, head of research at Knight Frank. Douglas and Gordon's Ed Mead described a “Mexican stand-off” between buyers and sellers, with buyers demanding lower prices that sellers were reluctant to offer. According to Savills data, London prices were down 1% for homes worth £2m-£3m and 5% in the £5m+ bracket.

Tyrie fears tax will hit challengers
Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, has written to the Bank of England seeking assurances that the 8% surcharge on UK profits will not penalise new challenger banks. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, head of the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority, Mr Tyrie asks: “In the PRA’s view, does the new corporation tax surcharge for banks make the retail banking sector more open to competition from new entrants, or does it further entrench the large incumbents?” He warns that consumers and small businesses have suffered for decades because of inadequate competition and choice in banking, and it is therefore crucial that competition from new and smaller banks is not unnecessarily impeded by regulation.

Beps splits opinion
The FT’s Vanessa Houlder looks at the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Beps) plans, which have divided opinion following their publication this week. Campaigners and some academics have said the OECD’s approach is fundamentally inadequate, but others including Deloitte’s head of tax policy Bill Dodwell say there has been “more cohesion than the naysayers were predicting.” The reforms are intended to make it harder for companies to siphon profits off to a tax haven, and will enable tax authorities to see where a company’s profits are made and taxes are paid across the world, allowing them to target audits. But many experts have warned there is a likelihood of uncertainty, disputes and double taxation for businesses, which will affect cross-border trade and investment.

Treasury admits families will be worse off
The Treasury has admitted that families hit by the chancellor's tax credit cuts will be worse off next year. It said "most" will not feel the benefits of a higher Living Wage and free childcare until April 2017. It comes after research by the Resolution Foundation suggested the cuts to tax credits and other benefits could push 200,000 children into poverty next year. Former PM Gordon Brown has also warned the policy shows the Conservatives "are simply out of touch and do not understand that tax credits lift hard-working families out of poverty where the breadwinner is on low pay."

Greeks pursued over tax on London homes
Athens is seeking tax payments from more than 3,000 Greek tycoons who have bought expensive properties in Britain. Greek finance ministry officials said that the UK government had provided it with the names of 3,200 Greek nationals who had acquired properties in London and other cities during the financial crisis. Athens believes that many individuals have taken millions of euros out of their country without paying any or enough tax on it. The Greek government is considering levying a property tax of around 1% on all homes bought abroad by Greek taxpayers and is drawing up a property register to enforce this.

ActionAid challenges "unfair global tax deal"
Anders Dahlbeck, ActionAid’s tax policy adviser, writes that in formally adopting "sustainable development goals" the UK has backed an unfair global tax deal that will do little to curb tax dodging by multinational firms in developing nations. Mr Dahlbeck suggests that we should be proud that the UK gives so much in international aid but warns that unless developing nations are provided with a toolkit to unlock tax billions they are owed, they will "never find a sustainable route out of poverty".

Contractors cash in
The Standard highlights a sharp increase in the numbers of people choosing to work as contractors, particularly in financial services. The percentage of financial services contractors earning £750 per day or more has almost doubled in the past year to more than one in 10 as demand has strengthened and skills shortages have become more prevalent, according to a survey by SJD Accountancy. New financial reporting standards have created strong demand for accountants specialising in derivatives, and banks are also bringing in accountancy skills on a contract basis to ensure compliance with new accounting standards.

Daniel Stewart misses deadline
Daniel Stewart has again missed the deadline for filing its annual accounts, and the London Stock Exchange has suspended the firm’s shares "to protect the market and investors". The FT suggests the latest suspension is a re-run of last October. Then, Daniel Stewart suffered a shortfall in the capital required of financial services businesses by regulators, which prevented it from filing its accounts.

Tax work boosting revenues at BDO
Tax work is the fastest-growing part of BDO's UK business, with revenues up 20% to £119m in the year to July 3. BDO managing partner Simon Michaels said the rise came from a growing workload across mid-sized and large companies rather than any particular tax reforms: "We’ve definitely seen a lot more large listed companies looking for advice outside of the Big Four". The Daily Telegraph's Marion Dakers suggests that many large companies are currently considering new auditors ahead of new rules requiring them to switch provider every 10 years: "While almost no big firms are hiring an auditor from outside the so-called Big Four of EY, Deloitte, PwC and KPMG, the reshuffle means these auditors are turning down work that could lead to conflicts of interest within prospective audit clients".

Smith & Williamson is noted as the administrators of Blinkbox.

Surge of interest in Lloyds shares
More than 120,000 people have signed up for updates from Hargreaves Lansdown regarding the planned sale of Lloyds shares after the £2bn sell-off was announced by the chancellor on Monday. Hargreaves Lansdown has been sounding out investors as it is likely to be authorised by the Government to offer Lloyds shares to its customers.

Interest rates held at 0.5%
The Bank of England has held UK interest rates at the record low of 0.5%. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted by 8 to 1 to keep rates unchanged, as they have been for more than six years. The Bank said cost pressures in the UK's labour market were rising too slowly for inflation to return to the Bank's 2% target, and that inflation would stay below 1% until spring 2016. But Mark Carney hinted that he still thought the conditions were right to consider raising interest rates around the end of this year and insisted the Federal Reserve’s decision on monetary policy was “not decisive” for the Bank.
