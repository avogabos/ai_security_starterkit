Dear Chris

 

We can file Dormant Accounts for the period mentioned, the cost is half of
the usual as we still have to file to Companies House and HMRC.

 

You will need to get the UTRs either way as even for dormant its required.

 

Let me know what you want to order, and Steve will raise an invoice for you

 

Thanks

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte

 

Regarding this email from your company.

 


Dear Customer,

Thank you for your email.

You are advised to send us the transaction details of your LLP for the
period from 26 Mar'13 till 31st Mar'14 and kindly subscribe for our
Accounting service (GBP 500) by following the steps given below.

1. Log on to  <http://www.accountscentre.com> http://www.accountscentre.com 
2. Click on My Account tab and enter your Login ID and Password. 
3. On the Unified Login Page, click on Accounting Services. 
4. In the Accounts Centre Profile menu, click on Update Services
5. It will take you to the page having the packages detail, mark a check on
option for Value Accounting and Click Next
6. Select your appropriate company Name
7. Enter the payment information to complete the subscription process.

Also, for partnership tax return (SA800) submission with HMRC, you will
require a partner's Unique Tax Reference (UTR) number. If you don't have the
UTR number and if you want us to request HMRC on your behalf then this
service will cost you additional 150 GBP.

Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.

Regards,

Customer Support,
Accounts Centre 

We obviously want you to register us for this UTR number and would like an
invoice to cover this, but in terms of the accounts for the period 26 March
13 - 31 March 14 there were no transactions at all. Therefore is there any
work for you to do. Can we just file a 'null' set of accounts.

Please advise.

Thanks

Chris
