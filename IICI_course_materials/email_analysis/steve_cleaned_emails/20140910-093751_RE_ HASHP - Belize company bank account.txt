Do you know if customer has already sent:

1. References - An original reference is required on the beneficial owner,
the directors and all signatories to the account. References from a bank
(preferred), a practicing attorney or a certified accountant are acceptable.
References should be recent, prepared on the referring party's official
stationery and should indicate the following: 

. The length of the relationship (this must be for a minimum of two years); 

. type of relationship; 

. status of relationship 

2. Photo Identification - A clear notarized copy of a valid driver's license
or current passport is required. 

3. Confirmation of Address, typically via the certified copy of a utility
bill. 

The banks do reserve the right to request additional information, but the
above is typically what is required. Personal attendance in Belize is not
normally required to open a Belize bank account.
