Hi Karim and Tim
We will only send Hard Copy of Certificate of Incorporation. To
obtain other company documents and information on nominees, please login to
your account at our website and download documents such as:
-
Certificate of Incorporation
-
Form IN01
-
Company Register
-
Share Certificates
-
Memorandum and Articles
Nominee Director can provide you with General Power of Attorney
at the costs of 200 GBP per company. Nominee Shareholder will only provide
signed share transfer form.
And as mentioned in our previous emails that Nominee Director or
shareholder will not involve in any company activities, so at the time of bank
account opening you will be required appoint your won director and shareholder.
Once bank account is opened you reverse the process.
And to open bank account with your own bank, these documents
will be enough, however bank might ask you for Apostille documents, which we
can arrange at the costs of 150 GBP per company.
Please note before applying for Apostille documents, please
change your director and shareholder by appointing your own.
Regards
steve

Hi Steve:
We have received confirmation that each of Argentum, Eventus
and Oxbridge have been formed.    Where do we get information on
the nominee directors, officers and shareholder.   Also when do we
get copies of the articles of association and memorandum.
I take it that each nominee shareholder, officer and
director will be giving a power of attorney.   When will we be in
receipt of such documents.
Which address have they been sent to.   
Finally, will these documents suffice to open corporate accounts where we
already have banking relationships
