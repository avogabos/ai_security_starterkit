Dear Steve,
Kindly correct the word: Entreprneurs on the fist page of the web site to read Entrepreneurs. 

It has been misspelled and WE ARE READY TO GO LIVE after that correction.

I am making payment RIGHT now.

Please make amendments and kindly proceed with the website ASAP.


THANK YOU A MILLION TIMES for ALL your help.

Regards,

Maria
