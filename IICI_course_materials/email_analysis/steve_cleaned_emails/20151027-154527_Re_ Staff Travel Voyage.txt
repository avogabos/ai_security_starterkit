Hi
Paul
To
issue new shares to new shareholders or existing shareholders we need to create
a share issue form/resolution, the resolution needs to singed and sent to
registry and then share certificates will be issued.
You
can generate share issue form/resolution using the Online Company Administrator
service. The service is for GBP 25 per annum. You can login to your account and
purchase the service, it will be activated within 24 hours after we receive the
order and payment.
Once
service is activated, it will give you several options to generate different types
of resolutions for changes in company, you can choose the option for Issue
Shares, provide details and submit. Then you can download copy of resolution
using the option ‘View Results of Previous Forms’, sign the resolutions and
email us the scan copy. We will then submit it to registry and on approval new
share certificates will be available.

Steve

Hi Steve,
Phil is planning to issue some new shares of STV to a few
new shareholders. He would like to provide a simple stock purchase agreement to
each new shareholder. Do you have any generic stock purchase agreements that
STV could modify for its use?
Thanks,
Paul

Hi Phil,
I am sorry can you please explain
what do you mean by ‘share diesperson’. If you are asking for shares transfer
form for offshore company, you need to do to shares transfer using Online
Company Administrator service, which will generate the form and it will be
submitted to registry.
Seychelles registry is now
processing Certificate of Incumbency, the cost is GBP 100 and will take 15-20
working days to issue the certificate. If you need delivery of document by
courier then there will be an additional charge of GBP 65. But since your
company Staff Travel Voyage Limited is expired, you will first need to renew
company registration and then you can apply for Certificate of Incumbency.
The company registration renewal is
OVERDUE, you must renew it as soon as possible to avoid further penalties. The
total cost to bring company in Good Standing and to process Certificate of
Incumbency will be:
-
Expired Seychelles Company Renewal :
GBP 600
-
Seychelles Registered Address : GBP
100
-
Online Company Administrator : GBP
25
-
Certificate of Incumbency : GBP 100
-
Courier Charges : GBP 65
Total :
GBP 890
Please use following information to
pay by bank transfer and once payment is done please send us the bank transfer
receipt.
