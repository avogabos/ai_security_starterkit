Good Afternoon Steve,

 

Thank you for your inquiry into our virtual office address plans.

Our business centre is centrally located on the corner of Boundary and
Kingsway at 3665 Kingsway in Vancouver. We have a very experienced,
professional and friendly team of staff who will support your client and
their business and serve their daily administrative needs. Our team provides
a professional edge and is well adept at taking care of their clients' needs
as well.

 

For our Vancouver mail forwarding/address plan, our regular rate is
$75/month. We are currently offering this plan for $50/month with the first
month of service free. Our terms and requirements include a one month
deposit of $50 held on file, which is refundable if you decide to terminate
the agreement at any point.

 

To begin the mail forwarding plan, we will require a signed copy of tour
agreement along with a photocopy of your client's ID (driver's license or
passport). You are also welcome to drop by our office in person anytime. A
cheque for the $50 deposit to Central Park Business Centre at the following
address (which will also act as your business address/mail forwarding
