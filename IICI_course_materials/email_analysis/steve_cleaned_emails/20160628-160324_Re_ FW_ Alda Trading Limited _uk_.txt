Dear Steve,

I have checked companieshouse and noticed that Alda Trading was dissolved
at 7th of June.
I informed my client and he was very glad.
But he asked me any certificate of liquidation or smth like this.
I uploaded from companieshouse that document (attached).

Is there any other document or certificate  for liquidation?
There is no problem just russian clients get used to see some more
documents when they
close for example russian company)) Thats why im asking)
If no, i just will explain him)

Thanks in advance.

There is no problem just russian clients get used to see some more documents when they
