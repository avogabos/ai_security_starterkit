Lib Dems set out tax plans
The Lib Dems have launched their manifesto with a pledge to raise the personal tax allowance to £12,500 and to increase the NI threshold to the same level as the income tax threshold. They also plan to restrict access to non-dom status by increasing the associated charges and removing the ability to pass it on to children. The party also wants to introduce a time-limited supplementary corporation tax charge on the banking sector and a graduated mansion tax on properties worth more than £2m. Also included in the manifesto are plans to create a dedicated unit in HMRC for medium-sized businesses.

Farage promises UK “low-tax revolution”
Nigel Farage has said that UKIP would look to kick start a “low-tax revolution” if it were to be voted into power, as the party leader launched its election manifesto. Mr Farage pledged that workers on the minimum wage would not be taxed, the 40p tax rate would be ramped up to £55,000, a new 30p tax band would be introduced and IHT would be got-rid of. UKIP also wants to enable small firms to complain to HMRC when someone in their supply chain repeatedly pays their bills late. George Bull, of Baker Tilly, said of the last proposal: “Using HMRC in this way is really innovative, really interesting, but it's giving them one more job to do.”

Umunna says 50p rate should be temporary
Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has warned that Labour must not "tax for the sake of taxing" and should bring back the 50p tax rate only as a temporary measure. He told the New Statesman. "I don't believe that you tax for the sake of taxing: you tax to fund public services and, currently, to reduce our deficit and our debt.” His intervention appears to contradict Ed Miliband, who has previously said that he would keep the 50p rate permanently. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reports that Mr Miliband’s most senior adviser, David Axelrod, pays no tax on his reported £300,000 earnings in Britain because he is not resident for tax purposes in the UK.

Tax transparency plan a “political gesture”
A Tory peer has claimed that David Cameron’s flagship initiative to force tax transparency on Britain’s overseas territories was a “purely political gesture” and should be ignored by the countries affected. Lord Blencathra, a former Tory home office minister, told the government of the Cayman Islands that the PM’s bid to increase tax transparency was an attempt to appease political anger at home. Lord Blencathra’s views were revealed in a previously unpublished submission to the Cayman Islands which was written last year.

Tax fears hit housing
The latest figures from RICS suggests that fears of a mansion tax and increases in stamp duty have contributed to a lack of houses coming on to the market, causing prices to rise across the country. A net balance of 21% of member agents reported that house prices increased in March, up from 15% the month before. Those expecting prices to rise in the coming year reached 70%, a 10 month high, with the average rise forecast to be 2.5%.

IHT reforms divide opinion
The Times carries several letters on the subject of IHT following the Conservatives’ proposal for a new “family home allowance” worth £175,000 per person. One correspondent notes that a pledge to raise the IHT threshold to £1m was announced by David Cameron in 2007, only to be blocked by the Lib Dems.

Survey echoes widespread malaise
The FT’s Michael Skapinker considers the recent survey by Options Group which suggested a majority of financial services workers are unhappy in their jobs. He says that the survey echoes a trend across a range of professions, from doctors to teachers, and concludes that a common cause of disenchantment across industries has been the increase in “regulatory intrusiveness.”

Lessons to take from US trade mission
The Guardian’s Trade Mission supplement presents conclusions drawn from the paper’s ‘Small Business Trade Mission’, which was designed to help 10 small UK firms start exporting to the US by providing expertise and connections. The Trade Mission highlighted the need for SMEs to conduct thorough market research and identify which region of the US to target, as well as developing a strong brand that appeals to American consumers.

Pension firms swamped
The Association of British Insurers says that pension providers received almost 230,000 phone calls - twice as many as normal - in the four days after April 6 as savers tried to find out more about their options after landmark changes. It was a 214% increase in expected average call volume during the period and equated to 57,483 calls each day, the ABI said.

IMF says UK will remain in deficit by 2020
The IMF predicts that Britain’s next government will not be able to balance its books by the end of the decade. The organisation estimates that tax revenues will fall short of the OBR’s expectations and whoever wins the general election on May 7 will be forced to spend more than currently planned. In its forecasts, instead of the deficit moving from £90bn in 2014-15 to a surplus of £7bn in 2019-20, it projects a deficit of £7bn in 2019-20, some £14bn worse than George Osborne’s Budget forecasts.
