Dear Steve,

Happy new year. I hope that you had a nice holiday and that this email 
finds you well.


Thank you very much for sending all of the information relating to the 
costs of forming a Seychelles company. We are very interested in your 
proposition and with this in mind would like to ask you to confirm the 
details of the ongoing annual fees, so that we can build these numbers 
into our projections?

Thank you once again and I look forward to hearing from you.


Kindest regards,

Uchechi
