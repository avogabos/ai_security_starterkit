Dear Both

 

We have not heard back from Barclays.

 

Talal will have to contact the Barclays support team and they will give him
an appointment for the 25th February. (the process takes about 5 mins)

 

Sarah, could you give the correct telephone number and branch addresses to
Steve.

 

Sorry I couldn't help more.

 

Thanks
