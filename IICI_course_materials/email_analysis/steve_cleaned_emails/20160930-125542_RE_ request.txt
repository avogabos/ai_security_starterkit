would prefer the first possibility.

Dear Martin Groh

 

Thank you for your email.

 

We can certainly provide you services in England however we are not
providing services in Gibraltar.

 

Following is the complete information on our services for UK company
formation.

In UK we can assist you in registering following type of companies:

 

1. UK (LIMITED) Private Limited Company by Shares

2. UK Private Limited Company by Guarantee

3. UK (LLP) Limited Liability Partnership

 

 

UK Private Limited Company by Shares:

 

The cost for registration is GBP 50. Registration will be done within 2-3
working days.

 

Basic Requirements are:

 

- Minimum 1 director (can be from UK or non-UK and corporate director not
allowed)

- Minimum 1 shareholder (can be human or corporate; director can also be a
shareholder)

- Registered Office Address must be a Valid UK postal address

 

Private Limited Company by Shares whether doing business in UK or outside of
UK is liable for corporation tax in UK.

 

To order go to : http://www.formationshouse.com/search/search.php

 

 

UK Private Limited Company by Guarantee:

 

A Private Company Limited by Guarantee is a corporate structure chiefly used
for non-profit organization that requires corporate status. Limited by
guarantee means a company does not feature a share capital, and its members
are guarantors instead of being shareholders.

 

The cost for registration is GBP 150. Registration will be done within 7-10
working days.

 

Basic Requirements are:

 

- Minimum 1 human member/guarantor/director (UK or non-UK)

- Registered Office Address must be a Valid UK postal address

 

To order go to : http://www.formationshouse.com/search/search.php and select
Company Formation(By Guarantee)  £ 150 form the additional list of
services.

 

 

UK (LLP) Limited Liability Partnership:

 

UK LLP is ideal for foreign nationals looking for a tax-efficient commercial
structure, whilst maintaining a corporate presence in the UK. A Limited
Liability Partnership (LLP) is a company established between at least two
partners.

 

An LLP allows for a tax-efficient strategy as they are considered fiscally
transparent by HMRC, so the Partnership itself is not taxed; only the
profits that go directly to the partners are taxed. As the partners are
taxed directly, this means:

 

- Non-UK residents will only pay UK tax on income that was earned in the UK,
so any trade occurring offshore from the UK will only be taxed at the
partners usual tax rate, depending on their country of residency;

 

The cost to register a LLP company in the UK is 500 GBP; the time required
to complete the procedure is 3-4 weeks.

 

The two basic requirements to form a UK LLP are:

 

1. A registered address in the UK (i.e. England, Scotland or Wales)

2. Minimum two partners required.

 

If you cannot provide 2nd partner for UK LLP, then you can choose Nominee
Partner service for GBP 500 per annum. We will register an offshore company
for you by appointing you as the director and shareholder in the offshore
company and appoint the offshore company as the 2nd partner in UK LLP.

 

To order go to : http://www.formationshouse.com/search/?ctype=llp

 

 

UK Registered Address Service:

 

If you cannot provide Registered Office Address, you can use our Registered
Address service for GBP 25 for the 1st year. Mails ONLY from Companies House
and HMRC will be received and forwarded to you.

 

 

DPS and SPS - Directors Privacy Service and Shareholder Protection Service:

 

DPS and SPS are services which enable Company directors and shareholders to
keep their personal information away from prying eyes and increase the level
of security for themselves and their families. Under normal circumstances,
the personal details of company directors and shareholders (residential
address) can be viewed by anyone who wishes to see the information.

 

For a very modest fee, we will provide a service address from our central
London offices, which will be the only address visible to the general
public.

 

The service address can be used for the receipt of documents on behalf of
the company director(s) and shareholder(s), which can be held for collection
or forwarded to any address in the world.

 

DPS and SPS provide company directors and shareholders with a higher level
of personal privacy than they would normally have and consequently raises
their level of personal safety.

 

The cost of the DPS and SPS service is

 

- DPS : GBP 150 (per annum)

- SPS : GBP 150 (per annum)

 

We do not charge any additional fees other than the cost of posting where
mail is to be forwarded to another address.

 

 

Bank Account Processing:

 

Bank Account Processing service charges are GBP 500 and processing time is
from 4 weeks to 8 weeks.

 

For UK companies we can process bank account with Barclays Bank in UK or
with an offshore bank in St. Vincent Islands.

 

To have a UK bank account, company director presence is required in UK.
Therefore it is mandatory that UK company director must be a UK resident.
Once we submit your request to the bank, bank will give us the date and time
for a meeting and company director will need to come to attend the meeting
at designated bank branch.

 

Or you can choose to have offshore bank account where company director
presence is not required and bank account can be processed remotely.

 

Terms and Conditions for bank account:

 

- Cannot provide bank account service to companies where director/s are
nationals/residents of USA or Iran either human or corporate.

- We do not guarantee bank account opening, final decision is taken by bank
and our service charges are non-refundable.
