Dear Josh
All
companies have to prepare basic accounts in Gambia, But not required to file corporation
tax returns as Gambia have ‘0’ taxation policy.
The name is
not a problem. You can use company name ‘
Institute
of Business And Chief Engineering Management’

Possible so that don't need to file accounting less paper
work for me if Gambia is offshore?
Kindly advise?

Hi
Josh
We
can provide an education provider licence in Gambia, you can operate as an
online education provider and later you may setup in the enterprise zone in the
Atlantic Institute of Technology campus area which is under construction and
will be completed next year.
The
degree courses are not underwritten by the University of The Gambia, but in
future if the courses are solid and delivered to a high standard they can be
underwritten by the Institute of Technology once completed.
If
all courses are delivered virtually, the licence application will be quick and
simple. The licence itself is issued by the Commerce Registry of the Enterprise
Zone of The Gambia. This means the holder of the licence may trade in the
Enterprise Zone or outside of The Gambia, they may not trade in the rest of The
Gambia.
You
will need a Limited by Guarantee company, with registered address etc and a
mailing address in Gambia too (within the enterprise zone).
We
may be able to arrange a bank account anyway but we would need to know the
ownership of the company first and intended student market.
To
process the licence we will need a 3 year business plan, all director ID’s and
CV’s, and to view the website and course materials being offered along with the
exam marking criteria etc.
The
cost of the licence is £15,000 for the first year and is renewable annually at
£10k per annum. If you have all documents in place the licence can be issued
within 4 weeks.
Regards
Steve

About incorporated university and license
Dear Steve,
Greeting from Josh Tth is nice to speak to you.
About license in Gambia not a bad place serious no matter
how in the history is under UK in the past if I am correct.
We mainly doing education no other sort of business!
Don't need to concern bank account as I think of solution
myself.
Most important is the authority can issues a education
license to operate virtually or later physically in Gambia offering
postsecondary course like Degree, Master and Doctorate.
Please advise me the licences and incorporated fee? And the
processing time?
Thank you,
Josh Tth
