He could buy a ready made company and get the merchant processing on that

But he would need to be in London a week before at least (preferably more)
to take over the bank account and would have to bring relevant ID

Hi

 

Can we arrange credit card swaping machine for customer with company and
bank account. Following is the query:

 

------------------------------------------------

Good day! I am from South Africa and I am planning on exhibiting at a Trade
Show in London (19-20 May 2013). We would like to be able to offer the
exhibition visitors the option to purchase our product with their
credit/debit card. In order to do this we require a card machine which will
be linked to a UK bank account. Please can you advise if purchasing an
existing registered company will allow us to do this? I look forward to
hearing from you soon.
