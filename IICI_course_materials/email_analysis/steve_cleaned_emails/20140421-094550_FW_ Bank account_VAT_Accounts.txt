Hi Charlotte/Steve

I have not had a reply regarding my email below from April 4th.

Can you please complete the VAT registration this week, as I need to bill a client at the end of the week.

Also, let me know how soon PAYE can be set up

Thanks
Chris

Hi Charlotte

We finally have the bank account setup.

So can you go ahead and register us for VAT.

Also, I would like to talk to you about the accounting and PAYE functions.

We should have money coming into the company from May onwards and I would like to be paid through PAYE from that time.

Please let me know what you need to proceed.

Thanks
Chris
