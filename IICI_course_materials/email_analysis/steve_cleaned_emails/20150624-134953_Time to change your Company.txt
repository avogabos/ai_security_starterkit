DARWIN TAX


** Time To Change Your Comapny
------------------------------------------------------------

UK companies have always been top popular among the foreign investors. Basically they act like tax havens, and they are as cheap and easy to use. Moreover, the company registered in EU has a much better look than those in offshore zones.
You have surely heard about The Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act in the UK, according to which all companies must maintain the Beneficial Owners registers as of January 1st 2016. There still remain a lot of details to make clear of. However, it is clear now that the new rules will be imposed only to UK Limited companies, and not to Limited, а не Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP) or Scottish Limited Partnerships (LP).
For those who enjoy the benefits of the UK entities, we offer a new Scottish LP (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=2540d5eabd&e=267b4f0486) set-up at special rate EUR 999 per year (including nominee partners and apostilled documents with General Power of Attorney: see the full package (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=2e0d8dd456&e=267b4f0486) ). You may register you new Scottish LP with the same or similar name as you UK Limited.
There are still a lot doubts, whether Scottish LPs will be involved in the Act at all.
But without any doubts, a Scottish LP can be the most harmless and least expensive transition from your UK Limited. Read more (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=d454f6bec3&e=267b4f0486) about benefits of the Scottish Limited Partnership in our blog.
