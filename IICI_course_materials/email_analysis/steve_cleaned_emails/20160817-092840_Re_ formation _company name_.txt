Tuomo,
 
One more issue that company name ‘FUNTASTIC LIMITED’ is not available for registration in England and Wales or Scotland because the name is already registered and company registration number is ‘04178900’.
 
Therefore please provide few alternate company names so that we can check availability.
 
Regards

Hi Tuomo,
 
The reason for system to show company to be registered in England and Wales is because you choose to use our Registered Address service and we do not provide Registered Address service in Scotland for Scotland Private Limited companies. Scotland Registered Address is only available for Scottish Liability Partnerships.
 
Please review my initial responses to your emails in which I have mentioned it as following:
 
=========================================
Scotland Private Limited Company by Shares : GBP 50:

You need to provide:

Registered Address in Scotland
Minimum 1 human director
Minimum 1 shareholder
========================================
 
Though we are going through very rapid changes nowadays, I have put up a query with our management if we can also offer Scotland Registered Address service for Scotland Private Limited companies and what will be the cost. I will update you on this issue by tomorrow and in case if it is not approved then you will be required to arrange your own Scotland Registered Office Address which must a be a valid street address. Note that, PO Box address is not acceptable by company registrar.
 
Secondly for due diligence we need color scan copies of following documents from company director and shareholder:
 
Mr. Tuomo Olavi Antikainen (Director)
1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport (all information and bearer signature must be visible)
2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (date, name, address and account number must be visible) - (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)
 
Novasigma Limited (shareholder)
1. Company Documents presenting beneficial owner name (Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles)
2. Proof of ID (Valid Passport) and Proof of Address (Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.) of the beneficial owner of the Corporate body - Novasigma Limited . (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)
 
If the documents are not in English then you need to have them translated and notarized. And send original and translated copies.
 
I will get back to you on registered office address issue, meanwhile please arrange above mentioned documents.
 
Regards
 
Steve…
