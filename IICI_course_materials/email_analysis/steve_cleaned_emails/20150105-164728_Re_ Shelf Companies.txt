Sorry regarding Media Spin Ltd there was some issue with
company, so unfortunately we have to remove the company from our list, the company
is no more available.
Regarding the pricing of companies registered in 2009-2010-2011
these are old companies therefore the price is high. And pricing depends on
name and registration date.
Regards
Steve
