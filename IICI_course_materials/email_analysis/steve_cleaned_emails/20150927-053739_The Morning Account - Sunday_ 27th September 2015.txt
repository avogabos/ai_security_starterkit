Labour urged to set out tax plans
Accountant Richard Murphy, who has been credited as the architect of “Corbynomics”, says shadow chancellor John McDonnell must clarify Labour’s tax policies. In an interview with the Independent on Sunday, Mr Murphy - whose ideas were the foundation of Jeremy Corbyn’s economic manifesto in the leadership campaign - said: “The tax area is actually relatively weak at the moment … He [Mr McDonnell] hasn’t talked about the reform of capital-gains taxation. He hasn’t talked about inheritance tax.” Mr McDonnell has said Labour would vote in favour of George Osborne’s fiscal charter, which commits governments to running a budget surplus by 2019-20, but he has also maintained he would oppose tax rises on low and middle income earners, leading to speculation about his tax plans for businesses and the rich. George Bull, senior tax partner at Baker Tilly, said: “The money has got to come from somewhere – a fiscal balance has always got to come through taxes.” Elsewhere, the Sunday Telegraph considers how Mr Corbyn’s economic approach could affect the country. It quotes IFS director Paul Johnson, who argues that increasing the top rate of tax from 45% to 50% would probably bring in very little extra revenue. The amount of tax that could be raised from big business is also questioned, with one unnamed tax expert stating that corporate tax avoidance makes up “a very small amount” of the UK’s tax gap.

Celebrities facing big bills
Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, actor William Roache and television presenter Melanie Sykes have been named as some of the hundreds of investors in film financing partnerships who are facing huge bills, after HMRC decided the schemes were a means of avoiding tax. In total, more than 300 rich and famous people face demands to pay six figure tax bills within 90 days after investing in the six film partnerships created by Ingenious Media. A spokesman for Ingenious said that the company had been trying to resolve the issue with HMRC and criticised the issuing of APNs as "heavy-handed and unjust".

IHT explained
The Sunday Telegraph’s Inheritance Tax supplement presents a number of case studies to explain how changes introduced by the Government in July will affect taxpayers. “Inheritance planning is complex. One thing is guaranteed - if you're looking to reduce your IHT bill, you're likely to benefit from expert help,” says Adam Price, of VouchedFor.co.uk. It also notes that David Kilshaw, EY's head of private client tax, has said that the IHT change is too complex. Elsewhere, the Mail on Sunday’s Personal Finance supplement offers advice to readers regarding their tax affairs. It explains the risks and benefits to be had from DIY accounting and tax planning and highlights the dangers of failing to make a will. It also lists the accountants that have received the highest volume of positive client reviews on VouchedFor in the past 18 months.

Harrods MD in stamp duty warning
Harrods MD Michael Ward has warned George Osborne’s stamp duty tax raid on the London property market could damage Britain by putting off wealthy visitors. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Mr Ward complained that the decision to hike stamp duty on properties worth upwards of £2m has sent a “worrying signal” abroad.

Pub boss laments VAT squeeze
Punch Taverns chief executive Duncan Garrood has pointed to the effect of taxes squeezing pubs as he confirmed plans to close 400 public houses in the coming years. Mr Garrood criticised the unequal tax levels for supermarkets and pubs, which see pubs charged 20% VAT on food sales, whereas supermarkets pay no VAT on the food they sell.

PENSIONS

Treasury reconsiders pensions Isas
The government is said to be reconsidering its plans to introduce an Isa-style pension system, following warnings that it could result in significant disruption for the industry. The Sunday Times says ministers are cooling on proposals that would scrap upfront tax relief after the plans were met with fierce resistance from life insurers and employers. The NAPF, which represents 1,300 schemes, warned that a move to a pensions Isa would, in effect, “double the administrative burden for schemes” and could cost the industry more than £300m.

Altmann unable to change pension situation
Pensions Minister Baroness Altmann has told the BBC she considered helping women who have had the start date of their state pension put back twice, but could not find a way to do so. Some 500,000 women in their late 50s were affected by the decision of the coalition government, which added up to 18 months onto the start date of their state pension. Speaking to the BBC's Money Box programme, Baroness Altmann explained she did not have “billions of pounds to spend on keeping state pension age unequal for longer.”

Alternative finance could hit £12bn in 2020
A study from the CEBR and payments firm Fiserv suggests alternative finance lending to businesses will hit £12.3bn in 2020, a tenfold increase from the £1.2bn loaned out in 2014. The report highlighted improving technology as the driving factor behind peer-to-business lending and crowdfunding. It stated: “This sector is likely to grow rapidly over the years to 2020. Partly this will come naturally through economic growth, but will also likely be due to these new businesses taking SME lending market share lending from banks.”

Commissioner to personally challenge late payers
Business minister Anna Soubry says she expects the new small business commissioner to personally challenge chief executives of big late-paying firms. The appointment of a commissioner to deal with the culture of late payment is a key measure in the Government's Enterprise Bill. Ms Soubry also accepted that in some cases companies would not respond to the pressure, but said there would be an investigation if a complaint is raised. Brian Johnson, partner at HW Fisher & Company, said of the commissioner: “It's a grand-sounding idea. But small business owners shouldn't expect a saviour who'll suddenly make large companies pay small ones on time.”

Record number of start-ups secure SEIS approval
Analysis by Radius Equity shows a record 2,905 start-ups applied to raise funds through the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme in 2014/15. It added that 94% of applications to HMRC for SEIS approval were successful last year. The growth, up from 2,845 last year and 1,729 the year before, is being driven primarily by high tech firms and the restaurant and catering sectors.

ECONOMY

Recovery stronger than previously thought
Official figures this week are expected to confirm that Britain’s recovery from the recession was far stronger than previously thought. The ONS will release on Wednesday national accounts for the second quarter, which will include big revisions to GDP data from 2011 to 2013. The figures are set to show Britain’s growth in 2011 was 2%, up from 1.6% in previous estimates. Growth in 2012 is likely to be revised up from 0.7% to 1.2%, while 2013 will also look stronger with expansion of 2.2%, up from 1.7% previously.

Rent-a-room bonus
Research by Airbnb has found that parents whose children have flown the nest can expect to make an average income of £13,650 a year by letting out their bedrooms via the website. The findings follow the chancellor’s announcement that, from April 2016, the tax-free allowance for renting a room to a lodger would increase. “The Rent-a-Room scheme provides a welcome tax break for those who let out furnished accommodation in their own homes," says Jane Moore from the ICAEW.
