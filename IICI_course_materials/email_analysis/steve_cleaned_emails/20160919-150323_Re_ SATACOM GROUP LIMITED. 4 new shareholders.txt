These are 4 new shareholders of SATACOM GROUP LIMITED.
Please renew online compny administrator and please make this
appointment for the company - resignation of old shareholder
and apoitment of 4 new shareholders.
Each new shareholder will get 25% of shares.
I know we can do it ourselfes at our id.
But we always order it like this with help of Formationhouse
managers. And now i'm afraid to make any mistakes in changing
shareholders. If its possible, we would like if formationshouse manager do it.
As it was before in our cooperation.

We sent 2715 usd. Its about 2000 GBP.
