Regarding the email below:

 

I am just waiting for a response from you concerning documentation, sent
earlier this week following an email from Steve Smith - obviously we need to
know we can meet the doc requirements before starting the process off as it
may turn out that we need to adopt a different approach.

 

I am re-attaching the documents in question and also need to know what is
meant by a certified copy of a passport - witnessed by a notary public,
signed photocopy - what exactly do you require?

 

I will be the UK representative, I am a UK resident and citizen - is it just
my passport that is required - my utility bills?

 

Thanks for your help.

 

Tim Davison
