Dear Mr. Steve,

 

Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta. Fortune

Since yesterday I was trying the renew the package , but for
reasons unknown it is not happening.

 

I have tried now also but could not understand whether it has
happened or not. Kindly check and let me know please.

 

Regarding the Tax filing----- Last year due to my health problems
and other issues we did not do any business. You can file a zero return please.

 

If you remember that I had once paid double for some of
your services. The amount was around 500 to 600 GBP. Charlotte

had told that she will ask you to give a credit of that and
adjust it in the future. Do you remember about it ? If yes then kindly use it
for the Office, phone line, Fax etc.  Kindly let me know.  Will wait
for your reply.
