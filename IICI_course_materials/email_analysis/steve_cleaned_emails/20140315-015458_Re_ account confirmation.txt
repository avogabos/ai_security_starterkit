Hi Steve,

I had a talk over the phone with HMRC office in regards to Tax Reference
Number and they confirmed the status of this issue. In brief, they said
that they had already sent the letter containing that number to your
office. May I know if you can upload it online?

Another question: I am still waiting for company documents to arrive and I
still have received nothing. May I know the date when you did send it? Any
tracking number for it?


Kind Regards,
Farkhat J.

Hi Steve,
In order to be able to go further with our startup ideas(in
business), we would like to be sure that our LTD company has a legitimate
existence in the UK HMRC office. As a confirmation, would you be able provide
us with any valid letter(with a company tax reference number on it) from
HMRC?
Would I be able to apply for business banking in
UK(non-resident startup account)?
Kind
Regards,
Farkhat J.
