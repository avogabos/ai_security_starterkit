Dear Ellen
After placing the order, you have to send us the payment.
Our Support team will contact you to provide documents for company director/s. And once we receive the documents and payment, we will then process company formation. Company will be registered within 2-3 working days then and you will be able to download company documents from your account at our website.
Regards
