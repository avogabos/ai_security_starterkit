Liberalisation brings tax and law sector cross-overs
The FT’s Jane Croft examines how the Big Four have taken swift advantage of the liberalisation of the legal services market which allows them to offer legal services. She notes how PwC is building its legal division while EY Law has hired partners from Freshfields and Addleshaw Goddard. However, law firms are responding by hiring non-lawyer tax professionals. Baker & McKenzie recently brought in former EY partner Mark Bevington while Pinsent Masons has formed its own tax investigations practice and brought in Heather Self, a former senior policy adviser at HMRC. Ms Self comments: “The interaction between tax and areas of law is now better recognised. Tax is more law than accounting in many ways.” Law firms are also forming partnerships with consultants and are moving into new non-legal businesses, writes Ms Croft.

Big Four taking in “hungry” school leavers
Major accountancy firms are increasingly turning to school leavers over graduates as they consider them "hungrier" and likely to stay longer, reports the Times’ Greg Hurst. Competition in the graduate recruitment market and a narrow field of candidates from Russell Group Universities has also spurred the change. The paper notes that Deloitte announced this week that it was doubling its intake of school leavers to 200 while PwC has tripled its recruitment of school leavers over the past five years to 160. EY’s Maggie Stilwell comments on school leavers: "They are really very polished, very confident, they come to us without any attitude, really hungry for the experience, determined to make this successful.” EY has increased its school leaver programme by about 50 to 150 while KPMG hired 256 school leavers this year.

Lynch sues HP for reputational damage
Autonomy founder Mike Lynch is suing Hewlett-Packard for $160m over the allegations of accounting fraud it has levelled against him and former Autonomy CFO Sushovan Hussain. Dr Lynch accuses HP of damaging his reputation and hampering his current venture capital fundraising efforts. He says that HP mis-handled the acquisition of Autonomy and released evidence to show they did not read a due-diligence report, compiled by KPMG, which made clear the differences in accounting policies on either side of the Atlantic.

Firms helping employees with London costs
In an article discussing the merits of working in London with its high housing costs, the Standard points out that accountants earn 20% more in the capital than elsewhere in the country, unless they work in energy and resources, which have higher wages in the South West. The paper also notes Deloitte’s graduate housing scheme in East Village and property-based incentives offered by other businesses for employees in London.

IoD calls for IHT and CGT to be merged
The Institute of Directors has said inheritance tax should be scrapped as part of a radical reform of Britain’s tax system. It is one of the most complicated and unpopular levies in the Britain, according to Stephen Herring, head of taxation at the IoD. “With a ridiculous number of exemptions, reliefs, tapers and time limits, no sane person would ever design the current system from scratch. It falls on owners of modest homes and those unlucky enough not to be able to foresee the time of their death, rather than the truly wealthy. It is time to put the nail in the coffin of the hated death tax. Capital Gains Tax can perform many of the same functions and we want George Osborne to merge the two.” The IoD also proposes cutting CGT from 18% for basic rate taxpayers and 28% for higher rate payers to 15% and raising the tax-free threshold from £11,000 to £25,000.

The perfect mix of London and NY
The Economist compares New York property taxes with those in London and believes the two can learn from each other to create a fairer system which raises more revenue. An optimal combination of the two systems would impose a relatively high, graduated levy on properties’ market value each year, with no exceptions. New York would have to abandon its property-tax abatements and make its tax brackets fairer while London would implement it by scrapping stamp duty and modifying the council tax to charge a percentage of each home’s current value. However, other taxes would still leave residential property being given too many special favours, the article concludes.

Osborne bends to tobacco lobby
The Chancellor was lobbied to drop plans for an increase in tax on tobacco products by multinationals including Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco. Doctors, cancer charities and the Government's public health experts had all backed the tax. Treasury documents show the tax would only bring in an extra £25m due to lower sales and increased costs to consumers. The plan, discussed before the election, was designed to contribute funds to the NHS.

IT contractors hit by high APNs
Tax investigations experts have suggested that Accelerated Payment Notices issued to IT contractors are among the most “voracious”. Moore Stephens is offering advice on dealing with the notices to contractors who are being chased for large sums, which can be as much as £100,000. “It is not uncommon for contractors to have entered multiple different schemes”, says Dominic Arnold, head of tax investigations at the firm.

Income tax still owed on buy-to-let
The Daily Telegraph’s Kate Palmer fields a reader inquiry concerning whether or not it would be possible to reduce the income tax they pay on a buy-to-let property, as they give their earnings to their son. Tina Riches of Smith & Williamson says that the parents should continue to be taxed “because rental income will still be treated as belonging to the 'transferor'".

FCA plans cap on non-advised annuity fees
The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed capping annuity brokers’ fees in a move that could boost a saver's retirement fund by thousands of pounds. Observers believe the cap could come into force in 2017 and predict it will limit commissions at 2% of someone's fund. A report from the FCA said: “Non-advice services are often more profitable than advice services because they have lower delivery costs, yet can often charge more, especially for ill health annuities.” A Treasury spokesman said: “We want to ensure that our financial services sector supports working people at every stage of their lives. That’s why we’ve launched a major new review into financial advice to explore what more can be done to make sure people can access high quality, affordable, tailored advice and guidance so they can make informed decisions with their hard-earned money.”

Productivity rises but manufacturers lose confidence
New data from the Office for National Statistics has shown that productivity across the UK economy has risen at its fastest rate in four years during the second quarter of 2015. However, surveys from the British Chambers of Commerce and Markit report that UK manufacturers have “low” confidence amid falling export growth and job cuts. "Job cuts send a signal that manufacturers are becoming more cautious about the future, which may lead to a further scaling-back of production at some firms in coming months", says Markit senior economist Rob Dobson.
