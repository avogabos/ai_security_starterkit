Hi Steve

Many thanks for your patience.  Attached is a copy of my I.D. docs.  I am having problems with my scanner and will have to forward the rest tomorrow.

Once again, I confirm the Co. Name is   'FARADI PRICE LIMITED'

The share holders will be me, John Price (ID attached) and
Nirvana Farhadi (Docs to follow)

Nirvana is also a director of Faradi Financial Solutions Limited

Re the PSC.  Can we have both names as PSCs?  

Re SIC Codes, I have given one code in the application.  Can we add to these afterwards or do we need to review them now?

Many thanks

John

Dear John,

 

One more point,
please note that company registrar consider director and shareholder as
separate entities even though it is the same person and since you have
purchased Director Protection Service which hides director’s address in public
records, you may as well need Share Protection Service to hide shareholder’s
address in public records.

 

Please advice.
