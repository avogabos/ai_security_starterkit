Dear Steve,

Thank you for your prompt and detailed response as always.

Please be kind enough to send me the link you mentioned so that I can file the changes for the corresponding charge and I will at the same time log in and finish the E-VAT registration as well.

Waiting for your reply I thank you once again.

Kind regards,

Maro
