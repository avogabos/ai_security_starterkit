Hi,

I see. I asked, because my customer wants to move his income in some safe
place, So could You propose me any solution with St. Vincent bank account
or in other safe place. What tax system would You prefer?

Important thing is that, the Client will stay in Europe and he would
withdraw money in cashpoints.

Hi,
Thank you for your email.
Following are the answers to your
queries.
1. How to draw the money from the
company in a legal way? Any documents?
Or do I simply go to the bank and withdraw the money without any questions?
What happens if I spend or lose the withdrawn cash? Should documents reflect
that?
Will there be any questions about the spent/lost money from the HK company?
- You can withdraw company from your
company’s bank account, by card or by online banking and you need to record
banking activity for your company’s balance sheet either showing profit or
loss. You have to manage this yourself.
2. Is there definitely no other
costs except from the preliminary fee and the renewal of the license after a
year? I understand that the fee covers the cost of setting the business,
opening the bank account and the annual service. After a year I pay 595 GBP for
the renewal and that is the only cost. Is that correct?
- Hong Kong Company Registration
cost GBP 595 and this includes:
Registered
     Address and Agent
Company
     Secretarial Maintenance
Government
     fees
Certificate
     of Incorporation
Memorandum
     & Articles of Association
Appointment
     of First Directors
Consent
     Actions of the Board of Directors
Share
     Certificates
Register
     of Directors and Members
Business
     Registration Certificate
Bank Account opening service cost
GBP 500. If you need Hong Kong bank account, that can arranged with HSBC, Hong
Kong, however company director will be required to come to Hong Kong and visit
the bank. If company director cannot visit Hong Kong than we can arrange bank
account opening with an offshore bank in St.Vincent, where company director
presence will not be required.
The annual renewal cost for Hong
Kong company will be GBP 700 per annum.
3. Since I do not pay any taxes in
HK, I could, theoretically, issue the invoices around to anyone, couldn’t I?
It seems that the HK company does not need any costs, since there is no taxes
to be paid.
- If you doing business outside of
Hong Kong, then corporation tax rate is ‘0’. However the annual cost will be:
Hong Kong Company Renewal – GBP 700
The Hong Kong company is required to
file its Annual Return each year. It must also ensure audited accounts are
prepared, maintained and filed, however the accounts of the company need not be
publicly accessible. We can do that for you for GBP 750.
4. What is the cost of international
bank transfers?
5. Is there any limit on cash withdrawals/internet payments?
6. Is there any fees for card payments outside HK?
7. In which currencies can I have my account? Is there any fee for issuing the
card or account maintenance?
- For HSBC Hong Kong charges you can
visit their website. You can set currency as USD or GBP or EURO.
8. Is it possible for the HK company
to have an account in UK as well? Can you help with that? Is it possible to
open it via internet or is a representative necessary?
- For Hong Kong company you can have
UK bank account, but we do not provide UK bank account service for Hong Kong
companies. You can need to contact UK banks yourself.
9. Can I have a nominee service in
HK? If yes, what would be the cost of it (set up/annual fees)?
- Natural Person Nominee Director
GBP 600 per annum
- Nominee Shareholder GBP 200 per
Annum
Please note nominee services are
only to fulfill legal requirements and will not involve in company activity or
bank account opening.
10. Regarding the functioning of the
company, what is my position? Should I hold any particular post or am I just an
attorney to handle all matters including the money withdrawal?
- You can appoint yourself as the
director and shareholder.

or assistance you can contact me at

HK offshore
Good
Morning,
Could you send me an up-to-date registration form for HK and whole docs,
please.
I have few questions, which I would like to consult with you first. I would
appreciate your fast reply:
The company:
1. How to draw the money from the company in a legal way? Any documents?
Or do I simply go to the bank and withdraw the money without any questions?
What happens if I spend or lose the withdrawn cash? Should documents reflect
that?
Will there be any questions about the spent/lost money from the HK company?
Let’s say I took money for an invoice, e.g. for distribution of leaflets, and
the same situation happens (I lose it or spend it) – what then? I would like to
know what happens with taxes in such cases when the money is withdrawn and
spent, but it is not my wage.
2. Is there definitely no other costs except from the preliminary fee and the
renewal of the license after a year? I understand that the fee covers the cost
of setting the business, opening the bank account and the annual service. After
a year I pay 595 GBP for the renewal and that is the only cost. Is that
correct?
3. Since I do not pay any taxes in HK, I could, theoretically, issue the
invoices around to anyone, couldn’t I?
It seems that the HK company does not need any costs, since there is no taxes
to be paid.
The matter of the bank is really important to me and I am not sure how to
verify it:
4. What is the cost of international bank transfers?
5. Is there any limit on cash withdrawals/internet payments?
6. Is there any fees for card payments outside HK?
7. In which currencies can I have my account? Is there any fee for issuing the
card or account maintenance?
8. Is it possible for the HK company to have an account in UK as well? Can you
help with that? Is it possible to open it via internet or is a representative
necessary?
9. Can I have a nominee service in HK? If yes, what would be the cos of it (set
up/annual fees)?
10. Regarding the functioning of the company, what is my position? Should I
hold any particular post or am I just an attorney to handle all matters
including the money withdrawal?
Thank you in advance for your feedback.
