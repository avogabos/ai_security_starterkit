HMRC seeks access to Mossack Fonseca papers

UK tax investigators have written to media organisations requesting access to the 11.5m secret offshore files leaked from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, after Germany’s Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper obtained the documents from an anonymous source. In a letter to the Guardian, Vicky Ranson of HMRC said: “I am very keen to obtain this data from you so we can cross-reference it with our own extensive data, to see whether there is information that we do not have and which could be useful as part of our extensive investigations into offshore tax evasion.” In 2010, the paper claims, HMRC obtained leaked details of 130,000 holders of secret accounts with HSBC’s Swiss private bank and appointed a team of over 300 tax officials to examine the evidence, however, as this resulted in no prosecutions, and led to criticism from the Commons' Public Accounts Committee, the Guardian's Luke Harding and David Pegg suggest HMRC will have to do more this time around. Others point out that George Osborne must ensure HMRC is sufficiently funded to investigate such data leaks. Meanwhile, David Cameron’s spokesman has declined to elaborate on his father Ian Cameron’s use of Mossack Fonseca to shield his investment fund, Blairmore Holdings, from British taxes. Mr Cameron is coming under renewed pressure to legislate for greater tax transparency in UK territories and dependencies after the Panama Papers showed the UK was second only to Hong Kong in a list of international jurisdictions where the banks, law firms and other middlemen associated with the Panama Papers operate. The FT points out that the leak will add to pressure for Panama to sign up to new international rules on the transfer of tax information. Panama, along with Bahrain, Nauru and Vanuatu, have so far refused to sign up. Elsewhere, Margaret Hodge has called for HSBC chief Stuart Gulliver to appear before the PAC after the documents showed HSBC routinely used the Panama law firm to shelter cash for thousands of clients - including its £7.3m-a-year CEO. Mossack Fonseca denies any criminal wrongdoing.

Cameron faces a "credibility test” over Panama leaks

Critics of the UK Government say the Panama Papers reveal the Conservative’s hypocrisy over tax avoidance suggesting its rhetoric is not matched with action. Richard Pyle of Oxfam says the leak “highlights the key role that UK-linked tax havens play in allowing a privileged elite to dodge paying their fair share of tax” while Toby Quantrill of Christian Aid adds that the “UK simply cannot continue to provide cover for the rich and powerful who wish to operate in the shadows.” Their comments come as the leak revealed three British and Channel Island banks - HSBC, Coutts and Rothschild - were named among the 10 banks that most frequently request offshore companies for their clients and several Conservative party donors, three former Tory MPs and six members of the House of Lords are among those with connections to companies on the books of Mossack Fonseca. Tax expert Jolyon Maugham QC says the Government talks tough in order to “appease the angry mob without actually doing much” and acts to protect the revenue afforded the City of London from facilitating offshore avoidance. However, the PM's spokesperson said yesterday: “The Government has taken a range of action to tackle tax evasion, avoidance and aggressive tax planning. Through the HMRC, we have already been carrying out an intensive investigation of off-shore companies, including in Panama. Clearly, this data may be able to assist with that.” Meanwhile, Robert Palmer, campaign leader at the Global Witness pressure group, argues that Mr Cameron now faces a "credibility test" and must use May's Anti-Corruption Summit to force the UK's tax havens to end anonymous company ownership. Separately, the Lib Dems have called for an independent investigation into what the Government knows about the avoidance-facilitating behaviour of its overseas territories and Labour's shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for “real action” to crackdown on offshore schemes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will insist today that there cannot be “one set of rules for the wealthy elite and another for the rest of us”.

Treasury sees 70% boost in inheritance tax take

Last year, HMRC collected £4.6bn from inheritance tax, compared to £2.69bn in 2010, data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed, a 70% increase. In the past 12 months alone, inheritance tax revenues increased by 21% to £4.4bn, compared to just under £3.8bn a year earlier. Commenting on the Treasury's rising inheritance tax revenues, Tim Fullerlove, Partner and trusts and tax specialist at law firm Wilsons, said: "Inheritance tax was originally intended as a tax on the very wealthy, but it has now become a general tax for a large proportion of the middle classes. With the increasing value of property, it is no longer just the large windfalls of inheritance from estates that are being taxed". Under a proposed Government scheme, the Daily Mail notes, households with estates worth over £2m could be subject to a £20,000 probate fee, instead of the current rate of £215.

Tax havens need not just to reform, but to end

More than half of the 200,000 secret companies set up by the Panama lawyers Mossack Fonseca were registered in the British Virgin Islands, writes author and former tax inspector Richard Brooks, where details of company ownership are not made public and don’t even have to be filed with authorities. Asked recently about whether Britain’s overseas territories should publish registers of beneficial owners of their companies, he observes, foreign office minister James Duddridge advised these were a “direction, rather than an ultimate destination.” The Panama Papers should expose such indifference for the scandal it is, adds Mr Brooks, to tackle the cancer of corruption at the heart of the global financial system: "Tax havens need not just to reform but to end," he concludes.

Benefits of Labour tax plans

During a campaign visit in Glasgow, Kezia Dugdale will claim that scrapping the council tax could mean eight out of ten Scots are better off than under the existing arrangements, as she accuses the SNP of failing to match her plans to “protect low and middle income families”. Ms Dugdale believes her plan to scrap the council tax would reduce bills for 80% of households, as a new poll suggested support for raising the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000.

Panama Papers create global shockwave

President Hollande of France yesterday pledged to investigate the documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca while tax authorities in Australia, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria all said investigations had been ordered. Ukraine President Poroshenko is facing a parliamentary inquiry after the Panama papers revealed that he had established an offshore holding company to sell his confectionery empire in 2014, while Iceland PM Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson faced calls to resign after the leaks showed that he had an undeclared interest linked to the wealth of Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir, his wife. Other high-profile figures shown to have paid Mossack Fonseca to create offshore entities in tax havens around the world include the family of Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, the children of Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev, King Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, and cousins of Syrian president Bashar al Assad. Actor Jackie Chan and the footballer Lionel Messi are also named. Messi's family released a statement denying wrongdoing and threatened to sue media outlets that released the information linking the Argentine to accounts in Panama. The FT details how Vladimir Putin’s close friend cellist Sergei Roldugin used a web of offshore accounts to hide $2bn, possibly on behalf of the Russian president.

ECONOMY

 

Housebuilding slows to three-year low

The Markit/CIPS construction PMI (purchasing managers' index) stood at 54.2 in March, unchanged from February's figure. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, says the construction sector was experiencing its weakest growth phase since the summer of 2013: "Heightened uncertainty about the business outlook appears to have weighed on overall construction demand so far in 2016, with survey respondents citing cautious spending patterns and a reduced willingness to commit to new projects," he adds. New orders showed the weakest rise since early 2015, while faster increases in commercial work and civil engineering activity in March helped to offset the slowdown in housebuilding. Over half of UK construction companies expect business activity to rise over the next 12 months, the data revealed, but the overall degree of confidence was said to be the joint-lowest since December 2014.

Cameron: Brexit would be an act of political and economic self-harm

Writing in the Telegraph, David Cameron warns that a Brexit would be “an act of economic and political self-harm” which would badly damage British airlines, car manufacturers and financial services companies. He adds that leaving the single market would hurt our industries and would be “needless and reckless”. He states: “In June, we can choose Britain's future. We can choose to shape our world, not to be shaped by others. We can choose to stay in the biggest single market on Earth. We can choose economic security, not an unnecessary leap in the dark. We can choose to be stronger, safer and better off - and that's what I hope the British people will do when the moment comes.” Meanwhile, a poll by ORB for the Telegraph has suggested that Mr Cameron’s campaign to warn voters of the dangers of leaving the EU is beginning to work. The poll finds that 51% of voters now support Remain - an increase of 4 percentage points from last month. Leave’s support has decreased five points to 44%.

Football clubs thriving

A new study by Begbies Traynor has suggested that English football clubs are in better financial shape with just two of England’s 72 top sides being in financial distress. “The football industry has never been fitter, and while many might think that it is down to the influx of big money foreign club owners, it is as much to do with the fair play rules and the HMRC stance on arrears, which have forced good housekeeping,” Begbies Gerald Krasner comments.
