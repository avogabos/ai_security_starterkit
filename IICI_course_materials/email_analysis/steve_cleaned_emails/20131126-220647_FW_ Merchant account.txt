Dear Rebecca,

My name is Azar. I live in Azerbaijan, Baku.

I would like to formalize merchant account without any tax implication. 

I have read from your website related to Merchant Starter Packs. I need to
clarify some points related to company and bank account. 

Is it possible to establish UK Company with offshore merchant account? 

Which banks are you using for opening merchant accounts? 

Are you charging your merchant's customers when they pay by credit cards? 

What is the payout period? Is it possible to get some part of payouts during
2 or 3 days after payment? 

 

Thanks,

Azer A
