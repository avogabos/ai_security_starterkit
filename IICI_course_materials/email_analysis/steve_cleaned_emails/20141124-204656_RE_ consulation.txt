Dear Majid
You
have to put assets into the bank name, whether these are cash then held by a
guarantor bank or share assets etc you have to put in the name of the bank.

Dear
Oliver
I hope you are well, thanks for your information about
London CSF. We are going to establish a bank in Gambia and wants to make
agreement with you in which its license be from there and be renewed every year
and provide its software system and its website. We want to provide bank
services according to London CSF services and “Science Development Commercial
Bank “, is the proposed name of our bank. All three members of the Board of
Directors, have 10 years experience in management and commercial and we are now
resident in Iran and soon we will announce non-Iranian nationality.
Since the UAE is a country where there is no tax on it
and is a free zone country, license for tax cannot be presented. So about this
paragraph “minimum of $500,000 in cash or liquid assets”, license of a general
trading or legal advisor company in the UAE is acceptable?
Best regards
Majid Azizpour
