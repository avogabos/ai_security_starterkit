Offshore trusts to be excluded from non-dom changes
Changes to non-dom rules published yesterday indicate that income and gains from some offshore trusts outside the UK will not be taxed unless family members benefit from the trust. The move is designed to create a degree of protection for those affected by George Osborne’s proposed crack down on certain aspects of the non-dom rules. This will see Britons who emigrate and become domiciled overseas become liable to tax on a worldwide basis if they return to the UK and non-doms living in Britain deemed to be domiciled there after 15 years of residence. The Treasury said some protection for those who had set up offshore trusts would relieve them of being forced to take “punitive and administratively burdensome measures” to create transaction histories for trusts set up years ago. EY partner David Kilshaw said the measures “reinforce the message that the government is keen to welcome new non-doms without driving the existing ones away”. However, the moves could also encourage “boomerang” non-doms who leave the UK for six years to “refresh” their non-dom status, he added. Legal experts said complications with drafting could mean legislation isn’t in place until the 2017 Finance Bill and that the Conservatives may shorten the 15-year period over the course of this parliament.

Ten boroughs provide a quarter of all stamp duty

The government raised £7.5bn from the tax in 2014/15 – the highest level since the financial crisis - beating the previous record of £6.7bn in 2007/08. Over a quarter of all stamp duty collected by the government in 2014/15 came as the result of property sales in just ten south-east boroughs. Data from HMRC shows that total stamp duty land tax (SDLT) reached £7.5bn, with £3bn from sales in London and £2bn from 10 areas in and around the capital. The overall yield on the charge represents a 16% increase on that for the previous year. HMRC said: “Nearly 47% of residential SDLT revenue came from property transactions under £500k compared to about 64% in 2006-07. This is partly due the higher tax rates on higher value property but also suggests the high value end of the housing market was less affected by the 2007-08 market crash.”

Property Partner to dodge taxes

Crowdfunding website Property Partner is now offering investors mortgaged flats and houses using a loophole to avoid the new buy-to-let tax. Crucially, the Daily Telegraph notes, the full costs of the mortgage will be deductible from investors' profits which will effectively then escape the buy-to-let tax announced on July 8. The company structure also means the new landlord tax, requiring buy-to-let investors to pay tax on the mortgage interest they pay to banks, can be legitimately avoided.

EY revenues exceed £2bn
A recruitment drive and investment in another Canary Wharf office put pressure on EY partner income last year, which fell to £700,000, down nearly 4% on the previous year. However, EY took on 4,500 employees, including a record 98 equity partners in the UK, and won Royal Bank of Scotland as an audit client during the period, along with J Sainsbury and the Co-operative Bank. Fee income in the UK grew by 8%, breaking through the £2bn mark, while worldwide revenues were up by 11.6% to $28.7bn (£18.9bn). Steve Varley, EY's UK chairman, said: "I am feeling very positive about the health of the UK economy. Improved market conditions have provided us with a great platform to further accelerate our investment in the business. We are seeing an increased demand from our clients for our services to help them drive growth and trade in both the UK and internationally."

CBI joins investors in backing private businesses
The FT carries a supplement on private business. In the lead article in the section, Andrew Bounds points out that all but 2,000 of Britain’s 5.2m businesses are privately owned and range from the Big Four to Warburtons, and the trend to stay private is growing. The importance of private businesses is exemplified by the appointment of Paul Drechsler as president of the CBI, says Mr Bounds. Mr Drechsler, chairman of Bibby Line, a family-owned conglomerate in Liverpool, says the CBI is right to focus on private companies: “They have a lot of entrepreneurial spirit. Bigger, listed companies often rely on innovations from the sector.” The CBI will be working to promote a British “Mittelstand” and help private businesses find experienced managers and secure long-term financing. The piece adds that investment in private businesses in Europe reached €4.1bn in the first half of 2015, compared with €2.3bn in the same period of 2014.

Javid: Support SMEs to reach potential
Sajid Javid, secretary of state for business, innovation and skills, writes in the FT on what the Government is doing to support private businesses. He points to British Business Bank programmes, which are already supporting £2.3bn of finance to 40,000 smaller businesses and the Start-Up Loans programme, which has provided entrepreneurs with more than 30,000 loans worth over £155m. However, SMEs remain stymied by problems such as a shortage of skills and difficulties in accessing finance. They deserve continued respect and support, he says.

US fears costs of EU tax probes
The US Treasury has raised concerns that EU moves to force firms investigated for receiving favourable tax treatment from governments to pay money back would ultimately impact on the US as the company would receive a credit for the levies paid overseas. The EU Commission is due to report on investigations into deals between Amazon and Fiat in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands.

ECONOMY

UK was fastest growing G7 economy in both 2013 and 2014
The ONS has released fresh and revised historical data showing Britain is now 5.9% larger than its pre-crisis peak, compared to the previous estimate of 5.2%, and that it experienced the strongest recovery of any G7 leading nation in both 2013 and 2014. Growth in the three months to June was 0.7% and growth last year was downgraded from 3% to 2.9%, but raised from 1.7% to 2.2% in 2013. Real household disposable income grew by 3.7% over the year to June, the highest annual rate since 2010, and employee total pay was up 4.7% - an eight year record. The current account deficit fell to £16.8bn in the second quarter of 2015 from £24bn in the first three months of the year and at 3.6% it was the lowest share of GDP in two years and below economists’ forecasts. Meanwhile, the trade deficit nearly halved from £14bn to a three-year low of £7.6bn. PwC adviser Andrew Sentance said the revisions meant the UK enjoyed average growth of 2% in the six years since mid-2009. “This is respectable growth in the new normal post-crisis world and puts the UK among the leading major western economies - alongside the US and Germany - in terms of growth over the recovery as a whole.” Deloitte’s Ian Stewart added that although the economy isn’t perfectly balanced, rising consumer spending “offers the best insurance policy against global weakness knocking Britain’s recovery.”

Will the Tories follow Labour on tax?
The Guardian’s David Walker looks ahead to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester and ponders whether or not civil servants will receive the same support as they did at the Labour conference. According to Walker, a Labour government would need “many more tax officials, armed with greater powers than they have now, if the huge sums in uncollected tax were to materialise”. He claims that HMRC has been one of the few departments in Whitehall to receive “encouragement” from George Osborne.
