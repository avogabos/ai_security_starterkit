If he files the SIC as central banking, FCA will immediately want him to
apply for a licence. We would not advise doing that and instead using a more
general sic relating to supply of digital commerce services. It can further
be updated later once a licence is in process.
When will the funds from Singapore be expected?


Please confirm what you mean by Koh Chee Peng is just administrator. Is he
not the beneficial owner?
