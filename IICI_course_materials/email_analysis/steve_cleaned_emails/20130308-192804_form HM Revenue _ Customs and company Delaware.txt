Dear Mrs. Smith
I have been asked to fill out forms by HM Revenue & Customs for my 
companies LLP, but the Forms shall be filled only by companies 
incorporated before the 25th October 2010.

I noticed that the two Delaware corporation (HORUS ENERGY LLC and ISIS 
GROUP LLC), which are partners of the two LLP, has been identified as 
English companies and not of the United States America.

Please let me have an answers
Thank You
best regards
