Miliband sets out Labour vision
Ed Miliband has launched the Labour party's election manifesto with a pledge to fund all Labour’s election promises without extra borrowing. Some of the main policy pledges include a 50p tax rate on incomes over £150,000 a year and abolishing non-dom status. Revenue from the proposed mansion tax on properties valued at over £2m would be used to fund the NHS, while rises in VAT and NI have been ruled out. The party also plans to raise the minimum wage to more than £8 by the end of 2019. The manifesto received a mixed reaction from business leaders, with plans to reverse the government’s latest 1% cut in corporation tax causing unease. The IFS claimed the manifesto offers little clarity on whether voters would be "signing up to significant spending cuts or tax rises" if they vote Labour. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank has warned that a Labour government propped up by the SNP will raise taxes, ease austerity and oversee a rise in interest rates.

Tax changes hit prime London sales
The prospect of a mansion tax and increases in stamp duty have resulted in sales of £2m-plus properties in London declining by 40%. Data from Lonres found that sales of these homes in the three months to the end of March were 38% lower compared with the same period in 2014. Sales of properties worth between £1m and £2m were also 8.5% lower over the same period as stamp duty reforms in December kicked in. Separate data from DTZ reveals that stamp duty changes have actually resulted in a fall in the amount of tax paid since transactions are down. Stamp duty revenue fell by almost £48m in the three months after the new tax rates were introduced. Separately, Savills has estimated that up to 250,000 homes in the capital may no longer be caught by IHT under the Conservatives’ proposed reforms.

Conservatives plan minimum wage tax breaks
The Conservatives will announce plans to take everyone on the minimum wage out of all income tax and raise the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 when the party launches its manifesto today. David Cameron is also expected to announce plans to take millions of people out of the 40p higher rate of tax. Meanwhile, the Telegraph claims that the Tories’ plan to fund an increased IHT allowance by targeting pensions could mean high-earners will be able to contribute no more than £5,500 a year into a pension if the party opts to reduce the annual limit on contributions.

Ricci heiress convicted of tax fraud
Arlette Ricci, the heir to the Nina Ricci perfume and fashion fortune, has been convicted of tax fraud by a Paris court after hiding millions in an offshore HSBC account. Ms Ricci was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to pay a €1m fine. Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge suggested the case reflects badly on Britain by comparison. "Britain has been pathetic - Yet again France has shown you can take people to court over tax evasion and win,” she stated.

Balls: South-raised taxes will benefit Scots
Ed Balls says that Scotland could be protected from its share of government cuts by Labour’s tax plans. Mr Balls said that Labour's planned mansion tax, which would raise money largely from London and the southeast, as well as a tax on bank bonuses, would deliver an extra £800m for Scotland. This money could be used by the Scottish government to cushion the effect of cuts imposed by Westminster and effectively avoid any departmental savings, he suggested.

Inaccuracy penalties treble
A Freedom of Information request from Baker Tilly shows the authorities are getting tougher on incorrect returns. It reveals that the number of individual penalties for deliberate - as opposed to careless - inaccuracies in tax returns almost trebled last year, climbing from 5,162 in 2012-13 to 14,401 in 2013-14.

Election turns bosses off spending
Deloitte's latest survey of CFOs at FTSE 350 and large private companies shows uncertainty over the general election is curbing investment plans. Only 51% of CFOs said that now was a good time to take more risk on to their balance sheet, down from a peak of 72% last autumn and the lowest reading in two years. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte said: "Corporate hiring and investment has led the recovery in the last two years. Yet this quarter's CFO survey demonstrates that business-hostile policy change remains a potent threat to the recovery.

Pay gap grows, especially in accountancy
A study to mark today's Equal Pay Day has found the gender pay gap has grown, with men now earning 20% more than women. The average salary men expected to make last year was £23,763, whereas for women the figure was £19,858. The widest divide was in accountancy, with a 29% gap, followed by banking on 22% and energy on 21%. Male accountants expected to earn £47,034, with women on £36,432.

Deloitte fine cut by £11m
The fine imposed on Deloitte relating to its dealings with collapsed carmaker MG Rover has been cut from £14m to £3m. The reduced penalty follows the appeals tribunal earlier this year which threw out eight of 13 charges against the firm in a case brought by the Financial Reporting Council. The fine imposed on former Deloitte partner Maghsoud Einollahi has also been reduced from £250,000 to £175,000 and his three-year ban from the profession has been reversed. The ICAEW, which has paid £5.3m towards funding the FRC’s disciplinary activity in the case, will receive the £3m Deloitte fine plus the £175,000 individual fine.

Pawnbroker’s unsecured creditors to miss out

Foreign funds to face India tax demands
Hundreds of international fund managers operating in India could be hit with large tax bills after Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the largest investors in the country, became the first foreign institution to confirm it had received a demand for payment. India's minimum alternative tax is levied on the profits of Indian companies at a rate of at least 20%, but has not been applied to foreign institutional investors until now.
