Chère Delphine,

Nous venons de recevoir ce mail, dont la signification nous inquiète dans la
mesure où lorsque nous avons fermé la société lannée dernière, vous nous
avez dit que tout était en ordre.

Merci de voir avec « the support team » de Formation House et nous confirmer
ma mail que nous navons pas dinquiétude à avoir.

 

Nous vous en remercions,

Très cordialement,

Eric Gilly

Dissolved Company

 

Dear ,

 

Re:PROPERTYNVEST GROUP LIMITED

 

You will be aware that it is illegal to dissolve a company which has
outstanding debts without appointing an administrator or receiver and
following the procedure provided in link below

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liquidation-and-insolvency

When your company was dissolved you had outstanding debts to ourselves.

When your company was dissolved you did not follow the correct procedure,
and as result you were in breach of your duties as a company director.

We need you to settle these debts immediately or we will no alternative but
to Notify the Insolvency Bankruptcy service and Companies house explaining
the circumstances of the dissolution.

They are under a statutory obligation to open an investigation into your
breach of duties as a company director, and this may lead to serious
implications, and costs to yourselves.

We have been very patient and given you time to resolve the matter, but we
regret that unless this matter is resolved immediately, we will have no
choice.

We are hopeful you will resolve the matter without us having to take the
regrettable action above.
