    Subject Line Best Practices   
 When you submit a completed account pre-approval form   
 use the following format in the Subject Line of the email      
    Pre-Approval - {Account} - {Agent}      
         
         
     
Begin the Subject Line with Pre-Approval as this informs the Account Manager that a new application is being introduced.   
  
The second part of the Subject Line is to replace {Account} with the actual account name of the application. For a corporate account, this would be the name of the company.   
  
The final part of the Subject Line is to replace {Agent} with your name or the name of your company.
