TAX

 

SNP will not adopt Osborne's 40p tax threshold change 

Plans from George Osborne to increase the threshold at which workers start paying the 40p rate from £43,000 to £45,000 in 2017-18 will not be implemented in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said: “By adopting a different path to the UK government we could generate more than £1bn of additional revenues, enabling us to protect the public services we all rely on. We believe that this proposal is reasonable. It is balanced and it is fair.” The basic, higher and additional rates are to be frozen at their current levels of 20p, 40p and 45p, leading to accusations from some in Scotland that the SNP had “bottled” it by refusing to increase the top rate of tax from 45p to 50p, a move Ms Sturgeon had backed before last year's general election. Personal allowances will also be raised by the SNP to £12,750 by 2021-22 - £250 higher than the expected UK level. Meanwhile, the leader of Scottish Labour, Kezia Dugdale, has vowed to scrap council tax and replace it with a tax based on the value of homes and enable councils to impose a tourist tax. Local authorities could also decide to impose a land value tax of up to 4% on vacant plots, Ms Dugdale said.

Autumn Statement could worsen Osborne's Budget black hole

Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation, agrees George Osborne is right to postpone until the Autumn Statement the decision on how to replace the cuts to disability benefits, but needs to be cautious. At this Budget, the Chancellor was protected by the upcoming EU referendum, he suggests, pension tax changes were put on hold and fuel duty increases were again avoided, instead there was an "experiment" with lifetime ISAs and a sugar tax with a two year lead in time for firms to prepare. "Unless the prospects for growth recover, the fallout from this Budget may pale in comparison to the Autumn Statement in a few months’ time," he concludes.

OBR chair warns Osborne over disability cuts U-turn  

George Osborne will have to increase taxes or slash spending to meet the Government's U-turn on disability cuts, Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned, adding that the levels of household deficit in the UK are "unprecedented". Mr Chote indicated the Chancellor will now breach the welfare cap by £4bn in 2019/20 because of the decision not to cut Personal Independence Payments, leading to a £20bn overspend above the cap over the next five years.

Fairness argument not cut and dry?

Several papers carry comment on claims George Osborne’s policies help the rich while hurting the poor. Daniel Finkelstein in the Times points out that keeping taxes down while controlling welfare spending was in the Conservative manifesto and IFS research shows that by 2020, there will have been "a similar change in incomes for rich and poor over the whole period since the recession.” Writing in the Telegraph, Ryan Bourne, head of public policy at the Institute for Economic Affairs, says Osborne has in fact hit the rich harder. He claims that real household income has risen faster for the poorest since the financial crisis and believes the cut to CGT will increase tax revenue rather than decrease it. The Independent’s Hamish McRae also suggests to consider the headline tax cuts as a "giveaway" to business misses the point.

Married couples missing out on tax break

The Mail reports that just 504,000 of the 4.2m people eligible for the married couples tax break have signed up. Someone earning below the £10,600 basic rate threshold can transfer some of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse, if their partner earns within the basic rate 20% tax band, leading to savings of up to £212 a year. The Office for Budget Responsibility has blamed computer problems at HMRC and a lack of advertising as the reason why so few had signed up.

Sugar tax will cost £1bn in extra debt payments 

The Office for Budget Responsibility has said a tax on fizzy drinks will likely raise the Retail Price Index measure of inflation by about 0.25%, leading to higher interest paid on index-linked bonds issued by the Government and a one-off extra £1bn in debt payments.

SMEs

 

Angels campaign to bring in extra £1bn investment for SMEs

A new campaign aiming to more than double the number of active angels backing UK firms by 2019 hopes it will lead to an extra £1bn worth of growth capital made available to SMEs. The Become An Angel campaign plans to recruit 23,000 new angels into the investor community and is the brainchild of Angels Den, a network that has signed deals with RBS and Grant Thornton. The initiative comes a week after the UKBAA announced the creation of the first angel accreditation and changes to CGT rules in the Budget that extend relief to angel investors.

Small businesses elect new FSB leader

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has elected Mike Cherry as its new National Chairman, to lead the organisation for the next three years. Discussing his vision for the future of the FSB, Mr Cherry says: “There is no other organisation which has the foundations in place to deliver the first class services, the real policy change, and the fantastic networking opportunities we can. Like any business, FSB needs to modernise and evolve if we are to continue to grow and meet the real challenges our members face. I’m confident we are more than up to the task.”

UK house prices up 7.9%

UK house prices climbed 7.9% in January compared with the same month last year, according to latest Office for National Statistics data. Price growth is being driven by the South East and London where prices rose 11.7% and 10.8% respectively. Excluding London and the South East, UK house price growth was 5.1%. Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, said that the figures "show strong momentum", adding that: "The recent changes to stamp duty, whereby supplementary rates will be charged on purchases of additional homes, may be providing a small boost to the market, as people rush to complete transactions before the changes come into force in April this year."

Creditors to vote on BHS rescue plan 

Creditors are due to vote today on the CVA plan proposed by BHS. The retailer wants to reduce the rent on 47 of its 164 stores by up to half and cut rents even further on 40 more stores. If the deal isn’t voted through BHS says it is "very likely" to go into administration putting more than 10,000 jobs at risk.

ECONOMY

 

UK inflation rate stays at 0.3%

UK inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index was unchanged at 0.3% in February, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Under the separate Retail Prices Index measure, which includes housing costs, inflation was 1.3% in February, also unchanged from the previous month. Other ONS figures published at the same time indicate that George Osborne is close to missing his target for cutting the country's budget deficit in the 2015-16 financial year. Government borrowing fell less than expected in February, bringing the total deficit for the 11 months of the year so far to £70.7bn, as against the chancellor's full-year target of £72.2bn.

Shore: Brexit will not cause panic in financial markets

Howard Shore, the founder and executive chairman of Shore Capital, has said that he believes Brexit will not cause panic in financial markets, and the City is likely to carry on exactly as before. Mr Shore said: “I don’t think any serious investor would really think that much would change if we were to leave the EU –  <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/21/brexit-would-not-lead-to-exodus-of-bankers-from-uk/> if we had a vote today and left, tomorrow morning nothing really of substance would have changed. Things would continue as they were before. You would then get into a period of renegotiation, the exit terms, new trade deals – people would learn to live with the new paradigm quite quickly.” He added that sentiment in markets was being driven more by other economic forces and geopolitical factors.

UK authors to get extra library payments after accounting error

Thousands of UK authors have missed out on a total of £264,000 in payments after a manual error was made by the Public Lending Right (PLR) scheme, the organisation which pays writers when their books are borrowed from libraries. The National Audit Office had found a mistake in its calculations which meant overall loans for the London region were under-represented when calculating the total sample.
