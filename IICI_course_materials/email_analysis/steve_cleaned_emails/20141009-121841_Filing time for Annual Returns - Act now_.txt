Do you need a Company Secretary for an Irish registered company?
Dear Steve,
At 
                              this time of year, the Companies Registration Office 
                              begins to receive the bulk of Annual Returns for 
                              filing. But not all of these returns will make it 
                              on time and late filing fees will apply.
Worse 
                              still, companies otherwise entitled to claim exemption 
                              from Audit will lose that ability for a two year 
                              period and will incur additional costs as a result.
Which 
                              is why
NOW
is the time to review the companies 
                              under your care - particularly those that are dormant 
                              to see what action, if any, needs to be taken.
You 
                              can check your companies on our sister website
www.vision-net.ie
to see which companies need to be brought up to 
                              date and which should be closed down.
And 
                              if you need assistance in this area CFI can offer 
                              you the following services:
