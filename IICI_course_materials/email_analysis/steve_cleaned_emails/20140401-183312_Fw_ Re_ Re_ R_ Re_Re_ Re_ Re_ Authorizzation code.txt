Dear Valter


Regarding the application, following is the information:


Box 1: You have to provide a valid UK trading address, the UK address you have provided, VAT office is asking you to provide proof of address documents. You can see box number 2, as what documents they would accept as proof of residence.


Box 4: The documents which are mentioned are required by VAT office, which I believe when we submit your application, we do not have those documents. You need to submit those now.


Box 11: You cannot mention Formations House as future agent. Becuase we do not act as agents.


Regards

Steve
