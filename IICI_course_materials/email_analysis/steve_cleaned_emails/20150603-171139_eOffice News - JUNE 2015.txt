Why eOffice? Our Members Had a Say
Following a recent study, concluding that people thrive at coworking spaces we decided to pop by the desks of some of our members and ask them "Why eOffice?" Here is what they shared :
John White
Radical Company
"
eOffice is a great environment to work in - flexible, diligent and attentive staff combined with great facilities and an energised community of companies make it a pleasure to come into everyday"
Max Higgs
Wei UK
"
We love that at eOffice a great effort is also put into creating networking opportunities between eOffice tenants and with the wider business community. The team, service and location made eOffice an obvious choice for our business."
Kristofer Mansson
Solibreaker
"
This is serviced office space as it should be. Out with the old model of a fancy reception area and dreadfully boring rooms. In with a modern open landscape, high-speed infrastructure, efficient support team and with rental flexibility ranging from hot-desking to permanent desks."
What to do when banks say 'no' to funding your business
Our eOffice member
FUNDING XCHANGE
has the answer to this vital question for every growing company.
You may have approached your bank and possibly found it difficult to secure the funds you require or were offered only parts of the funding you require. You are in good company. Banks are declining 50% loan requests from some smaller businesses -their decisions have very little to do with you and the prospects of your business or whether you can get access to funding.
Banks' outdated, costly processes and high costs of capital make it difficult to lend to owner-operated businesses and provide smaller or flexible forms of credit. As a result, availability of overdrafts - long a favourite tool for businesses to smooth their cash flow needs, has shrunk by more than 30%.
Here
FUNDING XCHANGE
(
www.fundingxchange.co.uk
) helps you - with just one request for funding you can reach many funders to get a transparent view of the available options for your business. Funders will get back to you with individual quotes - making it easy to compare offers. As a business owner, you are in control. You determine who you want to work with based on transparent terms.
