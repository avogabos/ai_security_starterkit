Re: Closing the company
Dear Steve,
I understood that total price is for all procedures for closing UK company.
Since the company didn't have many activities (two-three payments per month) is
it possible to reduce the price ?
Thank you,
Aksana

Dear Aksana Remsha
Thank you for your email.
We can assist you on
closing UK company
TRADING
SOLUTIONS EUROPE LIMITED (Company number
09214898).
If company is dormant then company dissolution service
will cost GBP 75.
If company has traded then company dissolution service
will cost GBP 250.
Please note that we will process
company dissolution with Companies House only. You will need to inform HMRC
yourself about company closure to cancel Payroll Scheme and VAT Registration.
Please advice how you wish to
proceed.
