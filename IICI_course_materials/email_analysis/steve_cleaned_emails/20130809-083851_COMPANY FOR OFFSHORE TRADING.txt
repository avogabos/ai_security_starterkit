Mr. Steve

Confirm phone conversation interested in buying a company in England, could
be London for conducting offshore maritime freight trading.
Have to be domiciliated in a place not considered a fiscal heaven.
We know of some related group, to have an LLP company with address in
London W1J5PR doing this type of transactions.
We also need to establish a bank account for conducting international wires.
