Conservatives to raise IHT threshold to £1m
The PM will today announce a plan to allow people to leave homes and other assets up to a value of £1m to younger family members tax free from April 2017. The plan will be paid for by imposing higher taxes on pension savings of people earning more than £150,000 a year. At present, 6% of estates are liable for IHT but this will rise to 12% by 2019. The Conservatives’ plan will keep the level at 6%. The individual tax-free allowance will be raised from £325,000 to £500,000 giving a married couple a combined £1m tax-free fund. “This is a tax that is meant to be paid by the rich and not by hard-working families who have saved to buy a home and improve it. That wish to pass something on is about the most basic, human and natural instinct there is,” David Cameron told the Sunday Times.

Labour pledge to raise £7.5bn a year from tax avoiders
Labour have said that should they win the election they will attempt to claw back £7.5bn a year by closing tax loopholes and clamping down on avoidance and evasion. Ed Balls told the Observer: “We will close loopholes the Tories won’t act on, increase transparency, toughen penalties and abolish the non-dom rules. And our first budget will make sure that following an immediate review of HMRC, it has the powers and resources it needs to come down hard on tax avoidance and evasion.”

Lib Dems will raise tax on dividends
Nick Clegg has unveiled plans to increase tax payments on share dividends by 5% to 37.5% for investors paying the higher rate of tax while those on the additional rate would see tax on share payouts increase from 37.5% to 42.5%. Experts said the plans would encourage companies to borrow rather than raise money by issuing shares but Lib Dem sources said policies were being built which would make debt financing less attractive. The Sunday Times says the raid aims to target executives who cut their tax bills by paying themselves through dividends rather than a salary, however, it will also mean 1.2m investors paying the 40p rate and 200,000 higher rate taxpayers will be affected.

BoE governor and bank CEOs hit by non-dom changes
The Sunday Times points out that the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has non-dom status, as do the heads of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, the CEOs of HSBC and Aviva and the incoming chairman of Barclays. Ed Miliband last week described the tax break, which allows people with a permanent home abroad to avoid paying UK tax on their overseas earnings, as “indefensible”. The paper’s John Arlidge explains why he thinks Ed Miliband is “killing the golden goose” with his non-dom plans.

HMRC hardening attitude towards errors?
Richard Dyson explores figures that suggest HMRC is treating the innocent mistakes on tax returns as deliberate in order to reap larger penalties. In the tax year 2012-13 penalties were issued to just over 5,000 taxpayers on the grounds of "deliberate" actions, but his rose to 14,000 in the 2013-14 tax year. Mike Down at Baker Tilly, who obtained the data from HRMC, said he suspected officials "under pressure to increase revenue" were inclined to "blur the line between different behaviours". Lucy Brennan at accountant Saffery Champness provides tips for those who may have made errors.

Taxpayers subsidise retailers’ profits
The Sunday Times examines a report which shows how “in-work benefits” are being used to subsidise supermarket profits as their savings from paying low wages are picked up by the taxpayer, with the cost often exceeding the retailers’ UK tax bills. Citizens UK estimates that £6.7bn a year would be saved if firms paid all workers the living wage. For example, Tesco paid £519m in tax last year but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers while Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits.

INDUSTRY

Foreign aid pays for consultants
Gethin Chamberlain explores foreign aid spending and the large amount of money the Department for International Development (DFID) spends on consultancy fees. According to the Mail on Sunday, £138m was handed by DFID to four consultancy firms last year. PwC received £122m, KPMG £10.7m, EY £2.8m and Deloitte received £3.1m. Campaigners criticised what they called the “moral corruption” of political parties taking large sums in political donations from these firms and then giving them lucrative contracts when in office. Ms Chamberlain says Britain is now handing more than £1bn of its aid budget to British and American consultancy firms which run aid programmes for profit.

PENSIONS

Pension Wise was a bargain
Ian Cowie and Teresa Hunter run exhaustive tests on Pension Wise to see how it performed with providing pensions advice. Both members contacted showed in-depth knowledge and gave clear explanations, they say. Ms Hunter concluded: “My 55 minutes with Pension Wise was a bargain. I felt I had received a service close to what I would expect from a typical financial adviser — without having to pay for it.” In a separate mystery shopper exercise by the Sunday Times, financial advisers were called upon for pensions advice, which was described as “petrifying” by Tilney Bestinvest’s David Smith, when he was shown the transcripts.

ECONOMY

Low growth, election and deflation concerns weigh on pound
Currency traders are warning that sterling could face further downward pressure as forecasts for Tuesday’s CPI figures predict Britain was likely to be narrowly in deflationary territory. This, combined with downward revisions for Q1 growth and increased nervousness over the election, will continue to weigh heavily on the pound, experts say.

Pay rises while jobless total falls
Experts predict that ONS figures to be released on Friday will reveal a further fall in unemployment to 5.6% in the three months to February, down from 5.7% for the previous quarter, and 30,000 fewer people claiming unemployment benefit. Average pay is expected to have risen also – up 1.9% over the year to February after falling back to just 1.1% in January.
