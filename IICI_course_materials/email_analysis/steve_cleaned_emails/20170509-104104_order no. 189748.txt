RE: RE: Re: Payment due
Dear
Nadine
Company names ‘PRO 6’ and ‘PRO6’ are provisionally available for registration and we can use the name for MAX BEST. Also if you wish, you can apply to restore the dissolve company. Let me know if you are interested in restoration of dissolve company, we will then arrange quote for it.
Note that restoration is expensive then registering a new company. Restoration will give you the old company number, you will need to provide proof of id and proof of address of last director/s who were in the company when company was dissolved.
For SIC codes you can submit up to 4 codes at one time. We are not in position to advice on SIC Codes, you need to choose codes which suits best for company’s business activity.
Please advice on above as how you wish to proceed.
Regards
Steve….
