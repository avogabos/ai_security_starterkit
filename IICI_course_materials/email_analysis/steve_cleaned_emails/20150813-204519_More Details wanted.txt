Dear Steve,

Plz send all details and fee for the services:
Company secretary 
Address
AR , gov fee and ur fee
Accounting etc.
VAT registration  


I'm thinking to start with UK company registration first and later I will proceed to Bank account and  merchant account .

Plz send details how I can apply for  your merchant account services later .
Can I get merchant account without Bank account ,and when I have received enough funds in my merchant account then I can visit UK to open Bank account .

What is the age limit of company director ,secretary , member shareholders .

Is there any option to have Reserve director like in Hong Kong .
Who will own the company in case of death of sole director .

May be my Passport number will change later ,so will it necessary to mention to Companies House and is there any charges for the process 

Regards

Fida Hussain
