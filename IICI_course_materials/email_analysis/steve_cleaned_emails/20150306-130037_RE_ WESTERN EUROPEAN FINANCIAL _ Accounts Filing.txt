Our Message to customer:

 

Option 1, we will show that GBP 33000100 as cash in hand/bank and process
the annual accounts showing '0' transactions. However there is a 1% chance
that HMRC might ask you to prove GBP 33000100 cash in hand/bank. Normally
HMRC do not ask. If you agree to this, annual accounts will be submitted in
48 hours.
