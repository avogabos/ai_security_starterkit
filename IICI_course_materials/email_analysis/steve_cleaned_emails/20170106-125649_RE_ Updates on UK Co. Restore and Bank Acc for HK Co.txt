Just spoke to Companies House and they are being totally rubbish, they said
they received the AP01 on the 15th and it is being passed on to the
Restoration Section, they advised to send the accounts. Client can speak to
them also 0303 1234 500 if they don't believe us. 

 

CONDUCTORES Y CABLES GLOBALES (CONDUGLOB) - I sent everything to the bank
now so not sure what else they need will email them now
