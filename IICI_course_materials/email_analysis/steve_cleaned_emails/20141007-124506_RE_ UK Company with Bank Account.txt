Hi Steve,
Then let's do a simple step process and get the company closed/shut down permanently,
we can form a new company later on with all new details and things to be decided later.
 
So instead of changing names,
kindly suggest what are the steps and process required to close the company with immediate effect,
 
The company did not make any business or activity in past one year since incorporation.
so closing the company will not  create any complex process.
 
Thus,
Kindly advise and let me know the process,
 
I would like to get this closed and settled by today only.
 
Make sure you also send notices to HMRC informing company has been closed.
 
Best,
aninda
