Hi Steve,
Reference the above company please find attached a copy of the directors passport and letters from her mortgage company and bank which show her address and account details. Just for reference I found that the documents would only open in internet explorer.
The company will provide graphic design services so I would say that the SIC code to use would be 74100 (specialist design activities).
The company's expected annual turnover is no more than £65000. Gemma Matteoni is the PSC with a 100% shareholding.
I hope that this covers everything that you need but if there is anything further please let me know.
Regards,
