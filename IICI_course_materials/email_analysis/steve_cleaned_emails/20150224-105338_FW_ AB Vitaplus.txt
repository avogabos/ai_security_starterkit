Dear Charlotte,

Thank You for the client! The applications looks good, although I was not able to ckeck everything since I do not have the corporate documents and ID documents of the client.
Just one remark regarding the business description - idealy, the client preprares the business description. So it needs to be written from the first person, and not third. Instead of writing that "software is made by the director Mr Santani", please write something like "The software is made by me" or "by us".

Dear Viktors,

Please find attached a filled form for our client Advanced Trading Systems.
It’s a Seychelles company and had an FBME account previously.

Once you let me know if the forms are in order, I will get the client in and take also copies of previous fbme bank statements with the usual ID docs etc. we have ordered corporate docs including the Incumbency.

Many Thanks


Kind Regards,
