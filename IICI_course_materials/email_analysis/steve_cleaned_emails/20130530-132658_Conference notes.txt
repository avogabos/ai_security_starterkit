Team Meeting 1,30

 

Not a lot of time to discuss performance so we leave that for next week.

 

UK Focus:

Sell the readymades with bank account - we have quite a few now and will do
more so get the old ones sold minimum is 3,500 for RM with BA, start higher
though and work down if necessary.

 

Support and Sales to work together better to organise who gets what. If
Sales people want to own all orders from a specific customer ID then they
need to tag or agree with support that its theirs. Sales should be focused
on cultivating the resellers for new orders and the new Gambia stuff, not so
much focus on the incoming web orders from new customers - although you get
first dibs if no upselling is done then it can go to support after the
initial order to chase upgrades and other services. 

 

The big new thing is the release of the gambia jurisdiction.

 

Monday/ Tuesday emails will go to a huge database of trust agents,
accountants and legal service providers.
