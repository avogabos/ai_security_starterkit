Dear Steve,

I still don't see a way to order from the website the afore mentioned
product (Apostille documents, including Certificate of Good Standing).
Please advise how this can be done.

Regards,
Dinko Georgiev

The agent in BVI have changed the prices for services, which we need to update on your website.
These are the best prices and time frame in which we can arrange the required documents.
