Dear Steve

First of all thanks a lot for your kind information.

Basically I am fine with your services, still need to get your advice how we would do best and what exactly we need:

I explain you the Situation:


 *   I need a trading company based in EU, UK is a good possibility in terms of administrational burdens.
 *   The trading purpose of the company  is to do grey market business allover Europe, which basically is absolutely legal, but can cause problems with suppliers for me.
 *   The company must have a structure that basically nobody can make a link to me personally or to one of my companies.
 *   Therefore I can not show up in any public listings of the company.
 *   The company will need a bank account in order to receive payment. Most preferably in the UK.

I have a trustworthy person to get involved with the company: As a shareholder if needed, as a Director (which will be needed for sure as I understood) as well as the contact for the bank.

My questions:

 *   If I show up as a shareholder, will I be publicly lined to the company? In such case, my contact would have to be the shareholder of the company as well.
 *   If my contact is shareholder and director, he will need to come to the UK to open the bank account, right?
 *   If I can be the shareholder: Can I open the bank accounts and come to the UK to open the accounts (without the director)?

As you may understand, we will need a registered address, where we can eventually receive mail from other than companies house etc.

Can you please quote to me under the above circumstances and recommend the optimum structure for us. We will need VAT registration as well.

Thanks so much, basically I am ready to fly to London to finalize all soonest in order to speed up.

Thanks a lot. Any further info you need, please get in touch.

Kind regards
