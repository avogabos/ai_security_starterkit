Hi,

Thank you very much for the info, I’m very satisfied with the service I have to say!

Just one thing, i can’t really find anything within that sic code list that covers our activity

We offer a title deed guarantee for people buying real estate. İt’s not an insurance, but a guarantee.

What business activity would that fit ?

Maybe 64999 financial intermediation not elsewhere classified 

Any licenses or permits needed for that ?

OK, I can confirm the POA

Business activity: We are offering a title deed guarantee to clients buying a property in Turkey after we do an extensive research. We also perform an audit on Turkish property developers and building companies and they can receive our label and offer the guarantee towards their customers. 

 

Any chance you already know the correct registered address and phone number? 

Just asking because we already have potential clients and would like to create advertising materıal before or during the weekend if possible ….

 

Thank you

Dear Laurens Van den Abeele

 

Okay we will produce the power of attorney. The cost for power of attorney is GBP 400. You can ordered 2 nominee director services:

 

-          Nominee Director – GBP 400

-          Natural Person Nominee Director – GBP 500

You only require Natural Person Nominee Director – GBP 500 so we will use the ‘Nominee Director – GBP 400’ service for power of attorney.

 

For power of attorney, please provide details of your business activity…

 

Please above information and confirmation, so that we can further proceed with company transfer. It will be done in 2-3 working days after we receive the above information.

 

In Virtual office you have phone call set to following:

 

-          Answering services: our operator will take call on your company’s behalf, take message and forward it to you by email.

-          Voice Message: you can setup a voice messaging service and voice message will be delivered by email.

-          Call forwarding: you can setup this and can receive calls on your landline or mobile.

Faxes can be access through our online portal or you setup to receive faxes in your email.

 

Regards

 

Steve

Thank you very much

I can confirm we will need power of attorney and you can issue it on my name as well.

Can you tell me when the world one ltd will be transferred ? 

Also when can you provide us with the registered address and phone/fax number ?

 

The virtual office, can you explain how it works exactly, for example when a phone call is being received ?

I read on your site personalized telephone answering, but what does it mean. Is it like a voicemail or how does it work ?

Faxes can be sent to our e-mail I suppose ?

Dear Laurens Van den Abeele

 

You might need power of attorney if someone ask beneficial owner to proof if he/she have the authority on the company. Power for Attorney will help you in controlling and managing the company but will not allow you to open bank account for the company. To open bank account you will need to appoint your own director and shareholder.

 

You can ask to resign the Nominee Director whenever you feel like.

 

It is not necessary to have a UK bank account and since you will not be trading in UK then VAT registration is also not required.

 

Nominee Shareholder will hold only 1 share in company and you ask to transfer this share to the real owner whenever you feel like.

 

The services which you have ordered, in your case we will only need proof of id and address of the person who is making the payment (card holder), however you can also provide the proof of id and address of the beneficial owner. And to create power of attorney will need due diligence documents of the person on who’s name we will issue the power of attorney.

 

Regards

 

Steve

Dear Steve, Felix

 

Thank you for the quick service and response

I have a few questions, sorry we are not very familiar with this concept, it’s new for us.

 

Can you tell me what the difference is between nominee director with and without Power Of Attorney ?

I thought it was implied in the concept of a nominee director. He does need to sign all necessary documents so identity remains unknown

So yes, we will need power of attorney I suppose. 

 

Obviously we would like to maintain full operational control of the firm. Can you tell us what will be done to guarantee my rights as real owner ?

I have heard for example about an undated resignation letter for the director which returns all the powers to the client ?

 

Also, as we are not invoicing in the UK, we do not need to open an UK bank account, do we ?

Also no UK VAT registration was needed, correct ? Tax filing can be done by your firm ?

 

Another question, we had to fill in a the amount of shares for the nominee shareholder.

İ have put it on 500/1000, does it mean that other 500 goes to director or me how does that work ?

Can I change to all shares for the nominee shareholder then ?

Finally, in one of previous e-mail you stated: One more thing, if you choosing nominee director and nominee shareholder and not appointing any of your own director or shareholder, then you only need to provide proof of id and proof address of the person who is making the payment. So I myself made the payment and proof of address but I am not beneficial owner of the company. Where does name of real owner needs to be mentioned exactly ? Does it have to be a natural person or can it be another firm (Global Sun Estate) as well ?

That’s it for now but we will probably have more questions later on …

Thank you very much

Hi,

Thank you

However there might be a small problem with the following documents: proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.

As we are curently living in Turkey and have a company here, all of our official documents (utility bills, bank records) have the name and adress of the company written on it (because we also live at our office) We do not have any of these personal documents.

But we can however sent you a copy of our residence permit, that is a government document where our adress and name is written on. Would that be OK as well?

We will probably go for a ready made ltd with nominee director and shareholder, registered adress and virtual office

We will take the ready made company PHD LTD (2005) but will change the name rigt away

Can you give me an exact quote for the services above ?

But i do have another few urgent questions, we will not directly sell goods to UK people so we will not actually have any income here, just the office.

How does this work with VAT/taxes,... Are we able to get an exemption of some sort. 

Also can you help us with the necessary administration (filing taxes etc) and what will this cost ?

So we will probably start the procedure today, how does that work, what do we need to do first ?

Business activity: We are offering a title deed guarantee to clients buying a property in Turkey after we do an extensive research. We also perform an audit on Turkish property developers and building companies and they can receive our label and offer the guarantee towards their customers.
Any chance you already know the correct registered address and phone number?
Just asking because we already have potential clients and would like to create advertising materıal before or during the weekend if possible ….
Thank you

Dear

Okay we will produce the power of attorney. The cost for power of attorney is GBP 400. You can ordered 2 nominee director services:
-
Nominee Director – GBP 400
-
Natural Person Nominee Director – GBP 500
You only require Natural Person Nominee Director – GBP 500 so we will use the ‘Nominee Director – GBP 400’ service for power of attorney.
For power of attorney, please provide details of your business activity…
Please above information and confirmation, so that we can further proceed with company transfer. It will be done in 2-3 working days after we receive the above information.
In Virtual office you have phone call set to following:
-
Answering services: our operator will take call on your company’s behalf, take message and forward it to you by email.
-
Voice Message: you can setup a voice messaging service and voice message will be delivered by email.
-
Call forwarding: you can setup this and can receive calls on your landline or mobile.

RE: FW: question about readymade companies
Thank you very much
I can confirm we will need power of attorney and you can issue it on my name as well.
Can you tell me when the world one ltd will be transferred ?
Also when can you provide us with the registered address and phone/fax number ?
The virtual office, can you explain how it works exactly, for example when a phone call is being received ?
I read on your site personalized telephone answering, but what does it mean. Is it like a voicemail or how does it work ?
Faxes can be sent to our e-mail I suppose ?
Thank you

RE: FW: question about readymade companies
Dear
Laurens Van den Abeele
You might need power of attorney if someone ask beneficial owner to proof if he/she have the authority on the company. Power for Attorney will help you in controlling and managing the company but will not allow you to open bank account for the company. To open bank account you will need to appoint your own director and shareholder.
You can ask to resign the Nominee Director whenever you feel like.
It is not necessary to have a UK bank account and since you will not be trading in UK then VAT registration is also not required.
Nominee Shareholder will hold only 1 share in company and you ask to transfer this share to the real owner whenever you feel like.
The services which you have ordered, in your case we will only need proof of id and address of the person who is making the payment (card holder), however you can also provide the proof of id and address of the beneficial owner. And to create power of attorney will need due diligence documents of the person on who’s name we will issue the power of attorney.
Regards
Steve

RE: FW: question about readymade companies
Dear Steve, Felix
Thank you for the quick service and response
I have a few questions, sorry we are not very familiar with this concept, it’s new for us.
Can you tell me what the difference is between nominee director with and without Power Of Attorney ?
I thought it was implied in the concept of a nominee director. He does need to sign all necessary documents so identity remains unknown
So yes, we will need power of attorney I suppose.
Obviously we would like to maintain full operational control of the firm. Can you tell us what will be done to guarantee my rights as real owner ?
I have heard for example about an undated resignation letter for the director which returns all the powers to the client ?
Also, as we are not invoicing in the UK, we do not need to open an UK bank account, do we ?
Also no UK VAT registration was needed, correct ? Tax filing can be done by your firm ?
Another question, we had to fill in a the amount of shares for the nominee shareholder.
İ have put it on 500/1000, does it mean that other 500 goes to director or me how does that work ?
Can I change to all shares for the nominee shareholder then ?
Finally, in one of previous e-mail you stated:
One more thing, if you choosing nominee director and nominee shareholder and not appointing any of your own director or shareholder, then you only need to provide proof of id and proof address of the person who is making the payment.
So I myself made the payment and proof of address but I am not beneficial owner of the company. Where does name of real owner needs to be mentioned exactly ? Does it have to be a natural person or can it be another firm (Global Sun Estate) as well ?
That’s it for now but we will probably have more questions later on …
Thank you very much

Hello,
İ have question about the quote in the e-mails below, this was put on hold because of other urgent matters. But we are still planning on setting up this company.
However, can we make a payment through

We would like to keep the payment out of our company records ...
Thank you

Unfortunately there is only a company credit card, not on a personal name
İ've been looking at some other doc's but it is always with company name on it ...
The residence permit was renewed at the beginning of this year, so could that work ?
I'll take a look if someone else could make the payment as well.

When was residence permit issued?
Also do company directors have personal credit cards in their name? if so then credit card bills must have director’s name and address printed on it?

Hi,
Thank you
However there might be a small problem with the following documents: p
roof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.
As we are curently living in Turkey and have a company here, all of our official documents (utility bills, bank records) have the name and adress of the company written on it (because we also live at our office) We do not have any of these personal documents.
But we can however sent you a copy of our residence permit, that is a government document where our adress and name is written on. Would that be OK as well?
Thank you

RE: question about readymade companies
Hello again
We will probably go for a ready made ltd with nominee director and shareholder, registered adress and virtual office
We will take the ready made company PHD LTD (2005) but will change the name rigt away
Can you give me an exact quote for the services above ?
But i do have another few
urgent questions
, we will not directly sell goods to UK people so we will not actually have any income here, just the office.
How does this work with VAT/taxes,... Are we able to get an exemption of some sort.
Also can you help us with the necessary administration (filing taxes etc) and what will this cost ?
So we will probably start the procedure today, how does that work, what do we need to do first ?
Thank you
