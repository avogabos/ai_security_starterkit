Dear Mr. Steve,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta !!!
 
Thanks for the reply but honestly Mr. Steve the reply you gave is humiliating and totally unprofessional.
To come back to the topic let me tell you the facts.
 
I leave aside the fact of my illness etc.
 
You guys were responsible for maintaining the company in Good standing. From the very first day of our association whatever you all said we did and paid you what was billed by you. 
 
You guys knew very well that the company for some reasons did not start up.
 
Your first mail regarding the annual returns came to me on 11.09.2015. The mail came to me in the registered email of the company. There you write that inspite of several reminders we have not responded to your mail. Mr. Steve that is the first mail sent to us from your company side, how could you write there that " Inspite of the several reminders " ????.
Taking for granted that you could not contact me. But what about our Director from London Mr. Bruno Machado ? Did you even tried to call him once for the matter ? I don't think that would have required a lot of money to call someone locally in London city ? 
 
In your first mail you even did not write the last date of submission of delayed Returns . Yes the Company House can go by their norms , but I am sure that there is a time frame within which you are given a chance to file your returns in a later date.
Have you ever mentioned the date to us ??
 
I Managed the fund as stated by you as early as I could and you got it I your account on 24th or 25 th of Sept 2015.
 
You were very confident in letting us know that the renewal of the virtual office will be done in no time and the accounts would also be filed within 2 days. There was no intimations from your company end  regarding the deadly urgency of the matter.
 
Your Accounts centre which is a part of your company should at least be aware of the rules and facts. We see no liason between your internal departments. For your information ---the same thing happened when we started with you. We were told that your company would help us to open our Bank account. After giving all the documents and evidences and being referred by your office to RBS, Hey Market Branch our account did not open for reasons still unknown to us. But later we opened the account in HSBC in no time.
 
Where question of professional activities are required we have seen unwanted negligence and incapability from your company end.
 
As you could not process the Annual filings as the company was already dissolved what part of the amount paid to you is still lying with your company kindly do let us know.
 
I have requested Mr. Bruno to talk to you in this regards. Kindly do the needful and oblige.
 


With sincere compliments & best wishes....
