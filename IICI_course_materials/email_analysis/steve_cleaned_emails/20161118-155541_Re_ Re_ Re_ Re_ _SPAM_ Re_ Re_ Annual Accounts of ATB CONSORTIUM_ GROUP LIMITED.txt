Re: Re: Re: Re: [SPAM] Re: Re: Annual Accounts of ATB
CONSORTIUM GROUP LIMITED
Dear Sir,
Our client wrote an email that before February 2017 (near
the date of next annual return)
he will change UK administator of the company ATB CONSORTIUM
and change reg.office address.
So he wants us to provide him
authentication code for this actions.
Could you please provide it? I will send it to client just
after your solving problems with CT600
submission.
Client is too nervous person, just cause troubles to us. He
shouts and always say
that he will write to Company House about our and your
(formationhouse) bad job.
He does not want understand any logical explanations. Its
really impossible to continue cooperation with him. Our work day starts from
his emails and calls and finish with the same. Even though there were not any
problems with his annual accounts. He finds new and new and new reasons to call
and shout to us.
It can not continue like this anymore. We wish he will
change UK administrator just after New year 2017.
It would be really better for
us and for you if this client will go to other UK administrators.
So please send me that authentication code as soon as possible.
When CT return will be ready, i
will send him CT return and authentication code and thats all.
Best wishes,
Ekaterina.
