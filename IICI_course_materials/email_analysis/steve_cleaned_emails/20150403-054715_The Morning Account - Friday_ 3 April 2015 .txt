IFS warns on pension withdrawals
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of receiving big income tax bills if they decide to cash in their pension pots from next week. From Easter Monday, anyone over the age of 55 will be free to cash in Defined Contribution (DC) pension savings, but only the first 25% will be tax free. The rest is liable to the 40% tax rate if exceeding £42,386 when added to income, a fact that the IFS believes not everyone is aware of. Paul Johnson, director at the IFS, had this piece of advice for pension holders: “If you can keep your income below the higher rate threshold, you're going to end up paying less tax than if you take it in a big lump.” Separately the Daily Mail includes a guide on how to avoid paying emergency tax on pension pot withdrawals. Danny Cox, a chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown, comments: “The basic rule on tax is simple. You can take a quarter of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. The rest is taxable.” The paper also provides a table containing a breakdown on what tax is payable on a variety of pension pots and incomes.

Executive says another HSBC breach is a ‘certainty’
Recordings of a confidential meeting heard by the Guardian are alleged to reveal that global head of sanctions at HSBC, Lee Hale, has told US regulators that the sheer size of HSBC means another 'big breach is inevitable'. The bank has been the focus of allegations that it helped thousands of clients evade taxes in Swiss bank accounts; and its Mexican branch was found by US authorities to be complicit in multimillion-dollar money laundering for drug cartels. HSBC’s chief executive Stuart Gulliver has repeatedly said that the bank has changed, and that he has greatly tightened internal management at the bank, dropping its previous federation structure. HSBC said in a statement that it did not recognise the Guardian's information, and that it was in compliance with its deferred prosecution agreement.

M&A figures down
Thomson Reuters reports that fees for global investment banking, from merger and acquisition advisory work to capital markets underwriting, totalled $20bn during the first quarter of this year. This is 8% down on last year at the same time, and the slowest first quarter for fees since 2012.

PENSIONS

Get ready for pensions of the future
The Daily Mail explores what type of reforms might be introduced regarding pensions in the future. It notes that the current situation, where basic-rate taxpayers get 20% tax relief when they put money into a pension, higher-rate payers get 40% and top-rate taxpayers get 45%, is an “incredibly lucrative perk”. It means that the top 8% of earners in the UK receive 50% of all pensions tax relief. The paper predicts that this is a situation that is unlikely to last, and expects reform of some sort, either scrapping the top rate of tax relief altogether or finding a middle ground of 33%. Various other potential changes to pensions in the future are explored in the article.

Lloyds to help SMEs
In the latest overhaul of its SME charter, Lloyds is pledging to help 1,000 small businesses break through the £1m turnover barrier. It estimates that achieving this goal within three years will add at least £1bn to the UK economy. Lloyds has been criticised for its role in the Scottish SME market, in which critics say it doesn’t do enough to aid small firms trying to access affordable and fair finance. Graham Blair, area director at Lloyds’ owned Bank of Scotland, addressed the criticism by saying that the economy depends on SMEs growing into medium-sized enterprises and that Lloyds would be offering them mentoring, sector expertise and business introductions. Lloyds is also launching an online banking channel dedicated to SME customers.

Funding Circle’s new funding round
SME peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle is about to announce a series of investments that will value the five-year-old business in the region of $1bn (£673m). The company has become the best known peer-to-peer lender in the UK, with to date, some 38,630 British investors having lent more than £589m to small businesses. Temasek is believed to be preparing the majority of the new funding, thought to be in the region of £30m.

ECONOMY

ECB warns of over-optimism
Despite the fact that the central bank has raised its forecasts for growth and inflation in the years to come, some members of its governing council have suggested that the projections are too optimistic. The word ‘risk’ appears 16 times in the minutes of the ECB’s March meeting; with the bank’s chief economist Peter Praet saying that the governing council had to remain cautious “given the very early stages of the economic recovery and the high degree of uncertainty.” Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg, added that “there are plenty of the risks” that both growth and inflation might be lower than projected.

Greece on verge of bankruptcy
Jose Barroso, the former European Commission president, has said that the Greek government made “completely unrealistic promises” to voters that it cannot now fulfil. He said that Alexis Tsipras's Syriza-led administration lacked experience and said that the country’s demands were “completely unacceptable to other countries”. He added that failure to strike an agreement that keeps Greece in the euro would put the whole currency in doubt. Yesterday, Greek government officials warned that the country could go bankrupt on April 9 when a €450m (£330m) loan from the International Monetary Fund is due.

ExxonMobil sues Russia over tax overpayment
US oil and gas giant ExxonMobil is seeking to recover part of $500m in excess taxes it paid to the Russian government on its profits from the Sakhalin-1 project in Russia's Far East. It has been paying 35% tax on its profits on the project. The level was fixed when the project launched in the 1990s, but the state has since reduced taxes to 20%.
