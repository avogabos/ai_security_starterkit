So he will just say to the bank, that he will collect it himself

 

And then we send it to him by courier

 

Ok ?

Pls get the salesperson to get the customer to say he will collect himself

The point of remote opening, is the bank think he came here - rietumu will
stop us doing the accounts if they think we don't actually see the customer

Dear Charlotte,

The client informed me that You are planning to courrier the Rietumu ID box
to him. Please note it is strictly forbidden. The client will need to come
to You personally once more in order to receive the box.
