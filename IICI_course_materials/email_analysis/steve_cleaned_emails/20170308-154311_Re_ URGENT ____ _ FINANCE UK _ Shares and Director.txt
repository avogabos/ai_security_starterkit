has been trying verify his presence on residential address that have been
provided by you which is:

Park Hill Road
Wallington

Companies House
are stating director Mr Gareth Edward Davies is not known at the above
mentioned address and Companies House is suggesting that they will report the
name as fraud. We are in communication with them to try and stop this, but a
second proof of address would greatly help. Therefore please arrange a latest

above mentioned address.
Please
resolve this issue as soon as possible to avoid serious complications and
consequences.
Eagerly waiting

Hi Cindy
Yes share transfer is complete. But
we have not increase the share capital, before we increase it I just want you
to know allotting maximum number of shares can cause tax liability on company
at the time of annual filing and will conflict with company status which is
DORMANT.
The best option is to keep share
allotment minimum to 1. Since only 1 share is issued and there are no other
shareholder, so current shareholder is considered 100% owner of the company.
Please advice how you wish to have
the share capital.
And there is small issue which we
will get it fixed by next week but it will not affect company operations in any
way, the issue is we have appointed current director as PSC but we are not able
to remove our person form the PSC, it will be done by next week as Companies
House and we are looking at our systems to resolve the PSC termination issue.
