Hi Thomas
Do as well need ACME SUPPORT
LTD, which was your previous order.
Also just to inform you that
companies with price 150 GBP are also for 165 GBP because we will need to file Annual
Returns after company transfer and Government fee for Annual Returns is 15 GBP
per a company.
Also we will need to add Nominee
Shareholder 25 GBP per annum per annum.
You will need Natural Person
Nominee Director 500 GBP per annum for UK companies because as per law there
must be atleast 1 natural person as company director.
Nominee Director 400 GBP per
annum gives you a corporate director. We can remove Nominee Secretary service
because it is not a mandatory requirement.
Please provide confirmation for
above and I will update you on discounted price.
Regards
Steve

Steve,
I am interested in purchasing  the   above
companies all with  nominee directors, and registered address in the UK
the purpose is  to  satisfy requirements for merchant processing
solutions offered by acquiring  banks.   No requirement for
bank  accounts or anything else, companies will not  trade directly
therefore there will be no turnover.
Please offer package pricing, we are prepared to purchase
immediately if   pricing  and  terms   are
acceptable, also will  have ongoing   requirement for 
approximately  three companies monthly.
