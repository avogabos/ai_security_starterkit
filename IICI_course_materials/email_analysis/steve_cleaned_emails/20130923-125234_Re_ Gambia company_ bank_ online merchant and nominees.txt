Thank you for your email.
My partners and I are reviewing the package.

Please confirm that the bank account opening is actually a bank account
opening and not a bank referral as some will do?
Which bank(s) will we bee looking at?
Kindly let us know what the specifications of the hosting package is so our
IT department can confirm if the spec can suit our need
Can we negotiate the price for nominee Director if we are having above
3-Nominee Directors?
Are there any latent/hidden charges that have not been disclosed (to us) in
the package?
We trust the Merchant account is also included in the starter package?
What is the Chargeback fee?
What is the Chargeback reserve?
Whaht cart will be integrated within our hosting package?

Thank you for the offer, your response will determine our next line of
action
