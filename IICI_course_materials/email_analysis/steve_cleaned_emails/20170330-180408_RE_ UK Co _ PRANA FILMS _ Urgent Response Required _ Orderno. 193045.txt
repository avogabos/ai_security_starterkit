Hello Steve

 

Likes buses, none for ages then two come along at the same time.

 

Please find attached Jennie Hammonds passport and a copy of her most recent
water bill.  The intended business activity is TV and Film production and
the expected turnover will be between £60k-£80k.

 

With regard to PSC, Jennie is the sole shareholder and therefore has the
right to appoint directors.

 

Kind regards

David
