Documents required for due diligence for company formation:



Scan color copies of following documents are required for company beneficial owner/director/s and shareholder/s.



1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport

2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)



If the documents are not in English then you need to have them translated and notorized. And send original and translated copies.



Company registration will be processed within 2-3 working days after we receive the order, payment and due diligence documents.

Hi Steve,
This is Nasrin Akbari from Sweden. Referring to the phone call earlier today together with my friend Sean about the registration of a company in UK, here I am sending you an email in order to get the information you gave us by that phone call.

What is important for me is:
Registration fee and the time lines and what is included
Mail handling and having an address
What to think and what is necessary to do in order to have it VAT registered and how long does it take? Can it be done later on?
What information or documents you need for the purpose of registering a company for me in UK
How can we have the directors name anonymous?
To have a bank account for the company , what is the fee if you do that vs the director do it on site directly at a UK based bank?

Grateful for any further information

BR
Nasrin Akbari
