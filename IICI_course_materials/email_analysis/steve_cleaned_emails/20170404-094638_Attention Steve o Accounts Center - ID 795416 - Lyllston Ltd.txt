Dear Sir,

 

You send me this official letter, from HMRC Revenue:

 A request to deliver a Company Tax Return for the period 01 March 2016 to
29 Feb. 2017 (I attached the letter)

 

We are surprised of this request as the accounts for the mentioned period is
to be filed by the 30 Nov 2017.

Regarding the accounts and balance for the previous period (March 2015 to
Feb. 2016) we believe that everything is clear.

 

Thank you for your assistance regarding this matter.

Please advice me if something wrong.

Regards,

 

Eric Gilly
