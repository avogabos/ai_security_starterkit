Steve,

I have 4 questions I forgot to ask:

1/The Gambia seems quite new when it comes to letting foreigners open companies there, are the banks reliable there? Will my information be protected?

2/How much do I need to pay each year to keep the company running?

3/Once the bank account is paid for, do I need to pay for it each year also?

4/Can a company have 2 accounts? for example if I have a company account in Gambia, can another account be opened in another country also?

Many thanks,

Yoni Cohen
