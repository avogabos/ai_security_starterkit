Hi Steve,

Spoke again with my lawyer about the new company, he said that at this
moment in time I should not be director of any company.

Maybe in 6 months to one year i can be director again.

Is it possible to get a director from your company in order to register him
as the director of Digital e-consulting Ltd?

If so would he gave me a power of attorney so i could work as lawyer of
Digital e-consulting ltd ?

If so what would be the cost?

Thanks in advance

Hi Steve,
Spoke again with my lawyer about the new company, he said that at this moment in time I should not be director of any company.
Maybe in 6 months to one year i can be director again.
Is it possible to get a director from your company in order to register him as the director of Digital e-consulting Ltd?
If so would he gave me a power of attorney so i could work as lawyer of Digital e-consulting ltd ?
If so what would be the cost?
Thanks in advance

Re: Re: New company
Hi,
Spoke
with the lawyer about the new company Digital e-consulting Ltd, and his counsel
was that i should register a UK Private Limited Company, instead of the Branch.
The
company Digital  Consulting Ltd from the Seychelles would be the owner of
this new company.
Can
you please change the invoice for the new service that i require and send it
back to me, in order that i TT the money to your company.
Please
note that the invoice should be sent in EURO
Thanks
in advance

Re: Re: New company
Hi Steve,
Can you please send me
an invoice in Euro. It is easier to do the payment.
I think that the
invoice should be sent to the new branch, Digital e-consulting ltd, so it can
be deductible as an expense of the new business.
a) Need to know how
will I send your account department the deductible expenses that this
company will have in the future?
b) Also need to know
what kind of expenses will be deductible?
Thanks in advance
