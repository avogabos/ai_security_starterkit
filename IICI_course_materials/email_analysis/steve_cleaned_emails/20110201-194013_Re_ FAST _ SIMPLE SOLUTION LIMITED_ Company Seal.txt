If you remember, I told you that we cannot arrange certificate
of incorporation for companies which are registered through other agents and
then transferred to us.
We can only arrange certificate of incorporation for
companies that are registered through us and that only once, at the time of
registration.
You can refer to my email below which was sent to you on
11 Jan 2011.

Steve

Dear Maria,
Re: Fast & Simple Solution Ltd – company seal
The courier company in Ukraine is trying to get to contact with you in order to
delivery your company seal. The telephone number that we have on file
(004402076124502) is not working. Please could you kindly provide a contact
number. The seal is still in customs.
