Steve,
Thank you for your help with this issue.  I understand that the 75 pounds for AA02 - dormant accounts and tax returns did not process.  However, before I submit this for order and payment again, can you please check on the status of our account as of 1/28/11?  According to email on August 17th, 2010, I was told that, as of that time, I had one accounting service remaining that would file the DCA and CT600 for the period ending 1/30/11.

From what I can see, I had these services:

Stefanie,
Attached is the CT41G for your company ‘
Integrated Auction Management Limited’. And the UTR (Tax Reference Number) is mentioned on the form as ‘Reference’. The document is also now available in your online account.
The UTR for
‘
Integrated Auction Management Limited’
is
6238754927191
.
For
CT600 - Tax Return -  year ending 1/31/2010, as you have received the form CT600, you can fill in the above mentioned UTR and mail the document to HMRC.
‘For
AA02 - Dormant Accounts - year ending 1/31/2011 and CT600 - Tax Return - year ending 1/31/2011 - requested & paid for this service on 4/26/2011’. Please note that the payment has failed. Please login to your account and use the ‘Update Payment’ to finalize the payment. Once we receive the payment we will the process the required documents.
And to request the waiver on penalty you can send the following message to HMRC.
“
With reference to the notices of penalty determination received by HMRC for the following DORMANT company,
Company Name:
Integrated Auction Management Limited
Company Number:
We would like to bring to your kind consideration that were under the impression that a Dormant company is not required to submit the Corporation Tax Return (CT600). Indeed, these companies are DORMANT from their incorporation.
We, therefore, request you kindly to remove/waive the penalty levied and send us the confirmation letters regarding the same.”
I hope with the above information all the issues related to HMRC will be resolved.
If you require further information, please feel free to contact me.

Steve Smith

Steve,
Per our conversations, here is the information about the status of our accounts:
Year ending 1/31/2010 - I was provided with CT600 with instructions for signature and filing.  However, I was unable to complete because I did not have the UTR.
Below is a summary of the contact I have had with Formations House regarding getting this number:
Feb 12, 2010 - Was advised that UTR is on the form CT41G that is sent to the customer by HRMC
I responded that I had never received it, and that I thought, as our representative, that Formations House should have been provided this information.
Mar 3, 2010 - Was advised that UTR had "not yet been posted to us".  But, that as soon as it is received, it would be uploaded to our online account.  This indicated to me that Form CT41G was a document being sent to us by HMRC.
In contradiction, this email also advised that I could "file the CT41G form now", by accessing the form online at HMRC website.  A link was provided to a blank form:  For Dormant Companies:
http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ctsa/ct41g-dci.pdf
This was completely confusing, because now instead of form CT41G being sent to us, this blank form indicates something that has to be complete and submitted to HMRC.  However, this form includes a space for the UTR, which, of course, I do not have.
At some point I was referred to this form on our online account - but I have never been able to access or open this link.
Mar 18, 2011 - I inquired the status of the UTR, as it had been over a year since the company was formed by Formations House.
Mar 19, 2010 - Was advised that Formations House had not yet received the UTR, but have requested it be sent to the Registered Office Address, set up by Formations House.  It would be emailed to me once received.
August 16, 2010 - Was advised that HMRC had changes it's policy and was no longer providing UTR to anyone other than the Director of the Company and was advised to phone HMRC Helpline.
The Directory of the Company, Adam Alexander, has not done this - due, in part, because of the time difference, his busy schedule, and quite frankly, because this is the kind of accounting function that he feels he has paid your company to handle for us.  The fact that we have been provided such incomplete, inconsistent and contradictory information is extremely disappointing.  However, at this point we have no choice but to continue paying for your services - at lease until we get this mess resolved.
Now, from what I understand from you, the CT41G IS a document issued by HMRC and should be available for me to access, along with our other company documents, on the website.
For your reference, I have attached the blank form CT41G that I mentioned to you.
Also attached are four (4) letters from HMRC we received via email from your company regarding delinquency and penalties for tax returns not filed.  These letters list a Company Tax Reference Number.  If this is the same as the UTR, then I can now file the return.
Base upon our conversations, this is what I believe needs to be completed to keep our accounts current:
AR01 - Annual Return - year ending 1/31/2010 - completed
AR01 - Annual Return - year ending 1/31/2011 - have filed online through Formations House website
AA02 - Dormant Accounts - year ending 1/31/1010 - per August 17, 2010 email, this was e-filed by Formations House.
AA02 - Dormant Accounts - year ending 1/31/2011 - requested & paid for this service on 4/26/2011
CT600 - Tax Return -  year ending1/31/2010.  This form has been sent to me, I just need the UTR to complete and mail in.
CT600 - Tax Return - year ending 1/31/2011 - requested & paid for this service on 4/26/2011, along with AA02 form above.
Unfortunately, I have discovered another issue while reviewing all this information.  The August 17, 2010 email indicates that our account reflected one  remaining accounting service which will cover the preparation of DCA and CT600 for year ending 1/31/2011.  This, of course, was not completed, which is why I ordered the additional services for 75 pounds on April 26th.  I have now paid for this service twice.
Steve, I hope I have provide this information clearly enough so that we can finally get this resolved.  If there is any other requirement that I have not listed, please advise accordingly.  Otherwise, I look forward to receiving the UTR and CT41G so that I can file these tax returns.  Further, after review of the delinquency letters attached, if you are of the opinion that these penalties can be waived upon submission of a letter of explanation from Formations House, then please forward one that I can included with the filing.
Thank you for your time,
