Hello,

İ have question about the quote in the e-mails below, this was put on hold because of other urgent matters. But we are still planning on setting up this company.

However, can we make a payment through Wester Union money transfer ?

We would like to keep the payment out of our company records ...

Thank you

Unfortunately there is only a company credit card, not on a personal name

İ've been looking at some other doc's but it is always with company name on it ... 

The residence permit was renewed at the beginning of this year, so could that work ?

I'll take a look if someone else could make the payment as well.

RE: question about readymade companies

Hi

 

 

One more thing, if you choosing nominee director and nominee shareholder and not appointing any of your own director or shareholder, then you only need to provide proof of id and proof address of the person who is making the payment.

 

When was residence permit issued?

 

Also do company directors have personal credit cards in their name? if so then credit card bills must have director’s name and address printed on it?

 

 

Regards

 

Steve

Hi,

Thank you

However there might be a small problem with the following documents: proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.

As we are curently living in Turkey and have a company here, all of our official documents (utility bills, bank records) have the name and adress of the company written on it (because we also live at our office) We do not have any of these personal documents.

But we can however sent you a copy of our residence permit, that is a government document where our adress and name is written on. Would that be OK as well?

 

Thank you

Hello again

We will probably go for a ready made ltd with nominee director and shareholder, registered adress and virtual office

We will take the ready made company PHD LTD (2005) but will change the name rigt away

Can you give me an exact quote for the services above ?

But i do have another few urgent questions, we will not directly sell goods to UK people so we will not actually have any income here, just the office.

How does this work with VAT/taxes,... Are we able to get an exemption of some sort. 

Also can you help us with the necessary administration (filing taxes etc) and what will this cost ?

So we will probably start the procedure today, how does that work, what do we need to do first ?

 

Thank you
