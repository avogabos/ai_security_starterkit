Dear Steve,

 

which bank account do you prefer: Swiss Euro, German or British (because of
the banking fees)?

 

By the way, one regular letter was sent on 22.10.13 from Germany to South
Africa by normal priority mail.

Please let the customer know and kindly ask him to tell you (and us) if it
arrived fine (when he gets it).

Hi Steve,

 

Courier shipments are paid for separately and prior to forwarding.

The cheapest but still reliable option would be TNT (it is part of the Swiss
Post). The shipment cost will be 90 CHF (ca. 73 Euros as of today).

Other couriers like DHL, UPS or FedEx will be much more expensive.

Hi Steve.

 

You are really early - we have got it already (in the morning) ;-)

need this forwarding via post to the new address I gave you in South Africa
please.   Just wanted to confirm this.

 

Thanks and regards
