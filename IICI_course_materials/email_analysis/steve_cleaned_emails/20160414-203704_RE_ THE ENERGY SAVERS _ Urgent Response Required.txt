Hi Steve

Thank you for your email.

We have a company called "The Energy Savers Ltd" in the Isle of Man and that company has been trading under that name since 2001 in the UK and in the Isle of Man.  Unfortunately we didn't think of registering the same name in the UK at that time.  The fact that we've had it since 2001 in Isle of Man, didn't protect the name or prevent anyone in the UK from using it.

As the name is critical for us, if we can't manage to get a similar name accepted, we won't need to set up the company.

I see that there is a company number 07691835 called Energy Savers (UK) Ltd, which was dissolved on 17th November 2015.  Could we get the name THE ENERGY SAVERS (UK) LTD accepted, now that the company referred to has been dissolved?

You would already have all Mr Huelin's details, the same time as you would have had mine, as he is already on all the Airtight / Airoseal companies that you set up for me.  Let's see whether we can get the name sorted first, if so we can then proceed with any other queries if still required.

Kind regards

Yvonne Brown

Hi Steve
Thank you for your email.
We have a company called “The Energy Savers Ltd” in the Isle of Man and that company has been trading under that name since 2001 in the UK and in the Isle of Man.  Unfortunately we didn’t think of registering the
 same name in the UK at that time.  The fact that we’ve had it since 2001 in Isle of Man, didn’t protect the name or prevent anyone in the UK from using it.
As the name is critical for us, if we can’t manage to get a similar name accepted, we won’t need to set up the company.
I see that there is a company number 07691835 called Energy Savers (UK) Ltd, which was dissolved on 17
th
November 2015.  Could we get the name THE ENERGY SAVERS (UK) LTD accepted, now that the company
 referred to has been dissolved?
You would already have all Mr Huelin’s details, the same time as you would have had mine, as he is already on all the Airtight / Airoseal companies that you set up for me.  Let’s see whether we can get the name
 sorted first, if so we can then proceed with any other queries if still required.
