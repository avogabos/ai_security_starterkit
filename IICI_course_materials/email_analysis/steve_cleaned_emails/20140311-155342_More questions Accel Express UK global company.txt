Subject: More questions Accel Express UK global company
From: <josen@accelexpress.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Ok thanks for the quick response.


So I would like to ask you for this company that I have been using Accel Express from Gambia, which would be the best solution. When I ask for a solution I am asking for the bank account, merchant account and swipe processing service. I would like to know what can you offer me that you think is the best solution. I travel so I like something mobile and be able to enjoy the benefits of the global company.


The more information that I can get the best, I really like something that will be efficient and in my case without my presence at this time. My big interest is getting the best of the Global company.

Hi Josen Puleo

 

 

Thank you for your email.

 

 

Currently opening bank account for a Gambia company is not possible, we are trying to get few banks on board to open bank account for Gambia companies, which take a little time. I can update you on this after a month.

 

 

If you need to have a bank account for UK company, that we can do with a UK bank or offshore bank in Cyprus. The cost is 500 GBP and takes around 3-4 weeks to process.

 

 

For UK bank account with Barclays your presence will be required in UK, we will setup an appointment and then you can go to the bank to meet the account manager.

 

 

For offshore bank account with FBME, Cyprus your presence is not required.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve
