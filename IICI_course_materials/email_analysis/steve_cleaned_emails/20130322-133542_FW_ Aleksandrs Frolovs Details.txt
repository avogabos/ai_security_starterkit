Hi Charlotte,

 

I have transferred my part of the payment onto your account. Also please
find copy of my passport attached. I do not have digital copy of utility
bill, so I will have to scan one and will send you copy tomorrow morning. 

 

Please let me know if you require additional information. 

 

Tanks 

 

Aleks
