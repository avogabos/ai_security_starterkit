Dear Sir

Re - London Drinks Import Export Limited  - 7501703

Companies House will require the following documents, with regards to Administrative Restoration:-

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration.aspx<http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration.aspx>

3)  Annual Return form for the year ending 21st January 2012, with the filing fee of £40.

Please note, the Accounts for the period ending 31st January 2012, will be due by 21st October 2012.

Having checked our records, as the above company was struck off the Register, prior to the last date for filing the Accounts for 2012, no late filing penalty would be generated upon its restoration.

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.
Restoration Department.
