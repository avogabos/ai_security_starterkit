VW’s US boss offers ‘sincere apology’

Volkswagen's US boss has made a sincere apology for installing defeat devices to cheat emissions tests on its diesel cars. Michael Horn, chief executive of VW's US operation, said the events were “deeply troubling”. However, he said the decision to use the devices was not one made by the company's board, but by individuals. Mr Horn said: “My understanding is that it was a couple of software engineers who put these in.” He said that three people had been suspended following the scandal, but they could not be named for legal reasons. Mr Horn added: “I did not think that something like this was possible at the Volkswagen group. We have broken the trust of our customers, dealerships, employees as well as the public and the regulators. Let me be very clear: we at Volkswagen take full responsibility for our actions and we are working with all the relevant authorities in a co-operative way.”

Conflict of interest at VW

Olaf Storbeck argues in the NYT that Volkswagen’s decision to appoint the chief finance officer, Hans-Dieter Pötsch, as chairman of the supervisory board, and the Porsche-Piëch family's support for former CEO Martin Winterkorn, is misguided. Mr Storbeck says both create conflicts of interest that cannot be reconciled. Mr Winterkorn remains CEO of Porsche SE, the holding company owning 52.2% of Volkswagen's voting stock. In the case of Mr Pötsch, the German law stipulates that a company's executive board carries joint liability for misconduct.

VW compared to Enron, Madoff

US politicians have compared the Volkswagen scandal to Lance Armstrong, Bernie Madoff and the Enron scandal, as the company’s US chief Michael Horn testified before the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr Horn denied accusations that the decision to fit 11m vehicles with “defeat devices” was a corporate one, claiming that it was a decision made by the engineering department. He offered his sincere apology over the scandal.

VW Australia to launch recall of 90,000 cars

Volkswagen Australia and its luxury arm, Audi, are to launch a recall of more than 90,000 local cars affected by the emissions cheat. The local brands announced the move after VW admitted that Australian diesel vehicles were also carrying software devices that tampered with the car’s emissions controls. Volkswagen Australia said it had run its action plan by government authorities and would write to affected customers to let them know what steps to take next. Managing director John White added: “The necessary measures will be undertaken at no cost to them [the customers].”

VW owners may receive full refund

VW has confirmed that it is considering full refunds for owners of "cheat switch" cars as compensation. Michael Horn was being quizzed by a Congressional hearing and was urged to refund the cost of cars found to have the device which illegally beat US diesel emission rules. He confirmed it was "one of the areas we are looking at". Mr Horn also said VW "could take one to two years minimum" to upgrade 430,000 cars' exhausts in the US.

They say they are trying to find out who was responsible for the alleged manipulation and how it was carried out.

German exports hit by VW scandal

German exports have suffered their steepest monthly plunge since the height of the global financial crisis.

Leading economic institutes warned that weakness in China could hit the German car industry especially hard, as the country accounts for more than 10% of Germany’s car exports.
