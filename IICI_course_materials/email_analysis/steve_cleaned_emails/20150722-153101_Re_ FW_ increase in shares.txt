Dear Majid
The increase in shares application is submitted for MAJESTIC
FUND MANAGEMENT.
The Hong Kong registry came back to us today asking for some
missing information. Some of the data was corrupted while filing the
application online. We have re-submitted the application and waiting for a response
from Hong Kong registry.
I will contact you as soon as I have an update.
Regards
Steve

FW: increase in shares
Dear Majid
We have submitted application for allotment of shares to
increase the share capital of Hong Kong company. Since we have not done this
before, so we have submitted application for only 1 company now to see if
everything is correct.
Once the shares are allotted and share capital is increased we
will then process the order companies. This will take a little time but
hopefully we will try our best to complete the process within this week.
Regards
Steve

Dear Majid
We have received the response from Hong Kong registry. It says
that if wish to increase share capital of a Hong Kong company you are required
to allotted shares to accumulate company’s share capital and within month you
have to show the share capital as paid up capital.
Please advice how you wish to proceed?

Steve
