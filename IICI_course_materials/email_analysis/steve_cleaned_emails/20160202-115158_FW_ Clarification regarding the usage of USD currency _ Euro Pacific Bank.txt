USD Clarification


Clarification regarding the usage of USD currency



Dear Partner


In last week's email we announced that Euro Pacific Bank is no longer accepting USD wires.


To clarify, we are no longer accepting USD incoming wires for corporate accounts, instead we request that all clients invoice in EUR, GBP, JPY or any of our other currency offerings.



Corporate clients may open a FREE non-USD bank account by sending a request to the banking staff via an internal bank message.


To prevent confusion, we will only be distributing USD wire instructions to personal account clientele who wish to take advantage of our brokerage and investment services.
