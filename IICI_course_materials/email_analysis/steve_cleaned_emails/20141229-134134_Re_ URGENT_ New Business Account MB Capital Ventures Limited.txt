Dear Steve,

Thank you so much for your kind update even though at this point where I am it is very difficult to alter my papers which I have brought with me and have the to the bank today and hold a meeting. 
They are not very helpful as I take it anyway or eager to work with me. 

Can we open up the account in another bank?
Can we look at a bank in St Vincent?
Can we move fast?

Please tell me. 

Awaiting with anticipation for your reply, I thank you in advance for everything you are doing. 

Kind regards,

Maria. 

PS. I will be going back to Greece tomorrow so I will be looking forward to continuing our progress from there since I can not stay here any longer for that matter....
