Please advice on following email from customer:

 

 

Hi Steve,

I called Amex and spoke to Accounts. They confirm the money was never
removed from your accounts. That they only sent a letter asking for more
information about what the payment was for but never took the money back
that I had paid originally. They double checked again today andconfirm the
money is still on your account and never was removed. 

Can you please confirm this end. The lady at Amex said your Accounts team
only need to check with their merchant provider who will confirm my money is
still with you. 

She believes your account team must have mis-read the letter asking for more
information but 100% confirm they never removed the funds from your
accounts. 

Please advise asap

Thanks and regards
Cathy
