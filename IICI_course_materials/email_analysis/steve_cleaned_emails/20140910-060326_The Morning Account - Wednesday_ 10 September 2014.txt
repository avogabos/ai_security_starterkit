TAX

Small firms facing rates rise
Around 67,000 SMEs in England face above-inflation rises in their bills next year, according to property consultancy Gerald Eve. The firm points out that the end of transitional relief for small businesses in April 2015 has coincided with George Osborne's decision to postpone a revaluation of the property values used to calculate the tax, with many facing steep rises in rates as a result. The FSB has said business rates are among the biggest concerns of its members, with online competitors increasingly able to undercut those paying for physical premises. Jerry Schurder, head of rating at Gerald Eve, said the chancellor should cap rates rises to inflation in December's Autumn Statement and promise a radical overhaul of the system.

Property taskforce targets the North West
A new taskforce launched by HMRC is now tackling people trying to dodge property tax in the North West and North Wales. The taskforce, which aims to recover £5m, is targeting people who have sold one or more properties and have not paid CGT or disclosed rental income. So far the HMRC's property crackdown, which has seen similar taskforces set up in London, the South East, and Yorkshire, has recovered more than £12m. "HMRC taskforces are deployed in sectors and areas where we've detected a high risk of tax evasion. For example, in a previous property taskforce in London in 2013 we uncovered a barrister who had evaded £471,512 in unreturned capital gains," Jennie Granger, Director General of Enforcement and Compliance at HMRC, explains. In the Telegraph, Matthew Lynn writes that tax campaigns targeting landlords are too heavy handed, and that people should be encouraged to profit from buying and letting property.

Mansion tax would cost £1bn
New research from Savills suggests a 'mansion tax' could result in the Treasury losing up £1bn in government revenues, by deterring wealthy investors from buying in London. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have proposed to tax properties worth more than £2m in the UK, but Savills says this would cause "a significant leakage" in government income from stamp duty, IHT and capital gains tax. "The imposition of mansion tax is likely to result in a reduction in the amount people are willing to pay for the assets on which it is charged," said Lucian Cook, head of residential research for Savills. "This would have a negative impact on both stamp duty and inheritance tax revenues."
The Daily Telegraph, Business, Page: 3

Brown's Scottish tax plan analysed
Following Gordon Brown's proposals for Scotland to have greater control over income tax, the BBC's Robert Peston ponders whether Scotland could compete with Westminster on tax. He concludes that it remains unclear, for example, how far and how fast a Scottish parliament could increase or reduce the rates of income tax in relation to the rates prevailing in the rest of the UK. Mr Peston is perplexed that Mr Brown's new settlement makes no reference to corporation tax at all, which to him appears to remain the preserve of the Treasury in London. The FT's George Parker says that confusion remains over the extent of the powers that will be granted, noting that Labour's Ed Balls is more reluctant to cede full powers over income tax rates to Holyrood than the Conservatives or Lib Dems. Writing in the Evening Standard, Simon Jenkins suggests that proposals to devolve greater tax-raising powers to Scotland beg the question of why similar powers have not been granted to London and other cities in England.

Oil taxes a sticking point
The Times questions who would cover the cost of decommissioning the North Sea's old platforms and pipelines in the event of Scottish independence. Westminster has made a commitment to pay for more than half the cost of decommissioning old fields by allowing oil companies to offset spending against their historical tax bill. However, the Scottish government has refused to assume all the liabilities of the fields it would inherit, saying it has benefited from only a fraction of the £300bn of taxes they have generated over their lifetime. Colin Pearson, EY's tax partner for oil and gas, said: "It would be illogical for Scotland to accept all decommissioning liabilities because the revenues from these old oilfields have been shared with the whole of the UK, sometimes for as long as 40 years."

Association opposes FTT
Simon Lewis, Chief Executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, writes to the FT to express his group's opposition to the proposed financial transaction tax. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe and other members of the European Forum of Securities Associations are writing to finance ministers of the participating member states ahead of this weekend's Ecofin meeting to explain concerns about the tax's possible impact on Europe's economy and its capital markets.

CIOT welcomes RTI exemption for small firms
HMRC has announced plans to exempt small employers with 49 or fewer staff from being issued with automated PAYE real-time information late filing penalties until March 2015. The CIOT has welcomed the announcement, with Colin Ben-Nathan, Chairman of the Employment Taxes sub-committee, stating: "Smaller employers, in particular, need a longer period of time to adjust to PAYE and other administrative changes because they have very limited resources which are primary geared to servicing their clients and customers."
Press Release

IT system blamed for accounting errors
A confidential report has criticised the Post Office over its handling of computer problems which led to some sub-postmasters being accused of theft and false accounting. More than 150 sub-postmasters claim they were wrongly prosecuted, or made to repay money, because of flaws in the system. After the Horizon transactions processing system was introduced in 1995, some sub-postmasters found that money from bank machines, lottery terminals, and tax disc sales did not match their computer's figures.

Restaurant insolvencies rise
Restaurant insolvencies have increased by 15% in 12 months as rising energy and food costs along with strong competition increase the pressure on businesses. According to Moore Stephens, 747 restaurants failed, up from 648 the previous year.

SMEs

FCA criticised over SME loan information
Treasury select committee members have criticised the Financial Conduct Authority for failing to respond to requests for information, warning that there was "deep disquiet" with the watchdog's approach. John Thurso, a Liberal Democrat MP on the committee, said the FCA had failed to be forthcoming about its internal auditing, the legal justification for it not regulating bank loans to SMEs, and over secret settlements with banks over misconduct.
The Daily Telegraph, Business, Page: 1, 3

Smart meters could lead to bills rising
MPs have warned that SMEs could see energy bills increase when the Government installs millions of smart meters across Britain next year. The Public Accounts Committee said the average cost of installing 53m of the devices will cost around £215 per home or small business over the next five years.

PENSIONS

Secession poses pension questions
Jonathan Guthrie examines how legacy pension schemes would have to be split in the event of Scottish independence. He says that compilations will result from England ruling out a formal currency union, and notes that European Union law would make it hard for employers to combine defined benefit pension liabilities for English and Scottish workers, assuming Scotland joined the EU.

ECONOMY

Carney predicts real terms wage rises
Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the UK's trades unions that wages should start rising in real terms "around the middle of next year" and "accelerate" afterwards. Addressing the annual conference of the TUC, he said workers "deserved" more money and added that unemployment should fall to 5.5%. Mr Carney said that interest rates should start rising next spring.
BBC News<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29108301>

Productivity gap shrinking
ONS figures reveal that the productivity gap - the measure of goods and services produced per worker per hour - is 11% lower than before the 2007/8 financial crisis, although this does represent less than the 13% originally forecast. Jonathan Riley of Grant Thornton, which has just published its High Growth Index, says: "A lot of businesses in the UK did not make as many people redundant as they did in other countries, so we had a greater workforce producing less."

Investors and savers turn away from Scotland
Industry executives are reporting that an increasing number of asset managers, investors and pension savers are moving billions of pounds out of Scotland as concerns about the financial consequences of a Yes vote in next week's independence referendum continue to escalate. One financial adviser said a client had shifted close to £1m out of stocks into a safer asset. Claire Walsh of Aspect 8, the financial advisers, said. "Some of them (clients) are elderly and nearing retirement and are worried about their assets." It comes as Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the TUC conference that a currency union between England and an independent Scotland would be "incompatible with sovereignty".
