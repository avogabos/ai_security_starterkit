Hi Steve.

I replied to you on March 28, 2014 and have not heard from you since then.
Did you get my reply?
If not, here it is once again:

First of all we need to know the name. If it is fine, then you need to fill
out the order form and have the customer sign the Disclaimer and then send
it to us by email.

If it is a company and not a private person, the price is 48 Euro per month
x 12 months - 20% discount = 460.80 Euro.

Payment options are like always - Paypal or bank wire.
