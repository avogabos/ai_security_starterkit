Dear Rozina
Thank you for completing due diligence.
We were submitting the application but came across one more
issue, that is of company’s registered address. You have mentioned Registered
Address as:
18 Riglands Gate
Renfrew
PA4 8NZ
Which is a Scotland address and region selected for company
registration is England and Wales.
Please confirm:
- If you wish to register company in region SCOTLAND, so that we
can region to Scotland and use the address which you have provided.
OR
- If you wish to register company in region England and Wales
then either provide Registered Address in England and Wales or you use our
Registered Address service for GBP 25.
Please provide confirmation for above as soon as possible so
that we can further proceed with your application.
Regards
Steve…
