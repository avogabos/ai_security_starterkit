Dear Sales team

 

As part of our ongoing improved compliance management we need to keep better
records of our resellers

 

Now I know I get run reports etc, but as we need to make some changes I want
to start with the easier and more common resellers

 

Each of you will have resellers you manage and email on a regular basis

Please send me in xls

The customer ID of the reseller

The name of the reseller company

The name of the contact there

If they are an accountant, lawyer or something else as a professional
service provider

Where they are located

 

thanks

 

 

Kind Regards,
