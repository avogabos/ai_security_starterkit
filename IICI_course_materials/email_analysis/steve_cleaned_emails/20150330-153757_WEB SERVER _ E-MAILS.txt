Dear Steve,

Do we have any news concerning the WEB service on your site? I still cannot create anything and use the service at all.
Any updates of the template of my cards that I should received via e-mail  and the actual printed business cards that I am to receive by post?

Thanks a lot in advance for your prompt reply and helps as always.

Best regards,

Maria Banakou
