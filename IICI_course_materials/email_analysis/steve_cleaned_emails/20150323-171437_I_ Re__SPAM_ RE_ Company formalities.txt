                                    TOP TOP URGENT Messrs

 With reference to  my previous communications, remained up to
date without  reply, I will not hide that
I am very worried!

On November
12, 2014, as per your request, I have sent the payment of your bill of £ 425
concerning the moving  of my company and the
preparation of all the operations relevant the yearly closure.

On January
23, 2015 I have confirmed the payment of £ 15 asked from  you for Government Filing Fee.

By letter
dated March 3, 2015, the Company House claims the non-execution of Annual return
and announces  that the failure to comply
may result in the directors being prosecuted, receiving a criminal record and a
fine of up to £ 5000

Given the
above, I would not think that I am the victim of a fraud  on your part !

I trust
that this communication will be read carefully by you and that you will not
fail to give immediate and complete response.I am looking forward to hearing from you.Best regardsPaolo

Messrs,
First of all I should like to inform you that I am very disappointed about your behaviour.
With my mail on November 12, 2014, I wrote :  "This morning, as per your request, I proceeded for the Bank transfer of £ 425 to settle your Pro-Forma invoice.This payment is related to :  moving of the Company FPS WORLD INVESTMENT LTD to your Registered Address Service, preparation and filing of annual account and corporation tax returns."
Following instruction as per your mail 7January 2015, I have filled in the form.
Following your mail 21 January 2015, I was asked  to pay £ 15 for Annual Government Filing Fee, on January 23 I sent you copy of the bank transfer.
Here attached you will find, once more, a copy of the bank transfer (Proof of payment No. 1) and also a copy of the statement for deduction of payment from my account (No. 2)
Having said the above, I receive this morning a letter (attached copy) from Company House , claiming for Annual Return not delivered.
I trust strongly to receive  asap your positive news on the point.
Best regards
Paolo

Dear Paolo,

Please contact your bank and kindly ask them if this payment of 15GBP has been deducted from your account and on which date please because we are unable to find any record of payment with the reference you have provided.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
