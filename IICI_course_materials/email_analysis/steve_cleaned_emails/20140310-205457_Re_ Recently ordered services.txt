Hi Steve

Can you please send me an invoice for the 2 services we have just paid for totalling £800.This was the Seychelles filing fees for MC Capital and Gatex

Could you also send me an invoice for the services just ordered for £450

This was for your fees for MC Capital, Gatex and Advanced Cloud Solutions LLP plus a registered office fee.

I would like to get these invoices before we transfer the money for the last order.

Thanks
Chris
