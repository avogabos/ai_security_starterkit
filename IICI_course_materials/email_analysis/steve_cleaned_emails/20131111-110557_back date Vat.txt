 Hi Steve, As discussed on Friday the form does not allow you to back
date your Vat to the date which I require so I was forced to enter a
incorrect date as requested by yourself so you can amend it from your
end, even though vat can be back dated from anything up to 3 years. I
would my VAT to start from the 4th of January 2013 (04.01.2013), if
this is an issue please inform me so I can make the necessary steps.
Kindest regards, Steven Love Company: Media Base ltd
