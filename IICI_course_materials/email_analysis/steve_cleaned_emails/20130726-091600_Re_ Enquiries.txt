Hello Steve,

Thanks for your reply. 

First, I will not be needing a website as i have one hosted already.

Secondly, I am looking at an option which is 

Group property investment services via our web platform where we will be connecting small and large investors with property sellers and in return the investors get a portion of the rent or the resale value according to their investment proportion.

We will be working in collaboration with established and experienced property managers.

I hope this is still under the jurisdiction you are offering. And please let me know the cost less offshore website hosting.

Thanks,
Wale

Hello,
 
I'd
like to do a UK Global Company registration. 
 
We
are looking to offer small and medium size business funding and investment
services via our web platform. The platform basically will connect small and
large investors with innovative entrepreneurs who require funding for their
businesses and in return the entrepreneurs agree to pay dividends to those
investors who have invested in their ventures.
 
We
work in collaboration with a long established international organisation and we
have a management team that has extensive investment experience and is composed
of professional men and women of proven integrity and excellent track records
whose vast backgrounds serve as a rich resource base for our overall business
successes.
 
We
would require a merchant account to accept investment funds on behalf of
entrepreneurs listed on our web platform. Others tools we will be offering on
our web platform to make transactions secure, swift and flawless include third
party e-money, e-wallet, prepaid debit cards and money transfer services.
 
I'd
like to request you advise on other registration requirements like licensing,
etc as well as costs. 
 
We
will also be requiring access to our bank account via the internet and will
like to be able to access funds at anytime and from any location.
 
I
look forward to your response.
 
Regards,
Wale
