Hi Steve,


Thanks for your prompt reply.


In fact it will be a small businnes company ( turnover +/- 40 K€ )

Main financial transactions will be from Morocco / Spain / Belgium / Germany & France to my account.

Is there any of these countries that not allow transactions to Belize or Seychelles?


Can you open a bankaccount in France for this company?


And what is the cost for all of this?


Waiting on your reply.


Rgrds


Koen
