Hi Steve,
Just wanted to check with you, when we purchase these BVI companies, are we able to do bank transfers for all monetary transactions?
Regards,
Malcom

 Dear Malcom

Thank you for your email.

Attached is the list of BVI Offshore Ready-Made Companies available. At the time of purchasing the company you can also request company name change. If name is available then it will be changed. Company transfer and name change request if submitted together it will take 15-20 working days for the processes to complete.

To purchase a BVI ready-made company you can view the attach list, choose a company and inform us along with additional services required. We will send you the quote and when you confirm we will send you the invoice. You will make payment by bank transfer and send us bank transfer reciept along with notarized due diligence documents for company director/s and shareholder/s.

If you require further information or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone or by live chat on our website.
