Dear Mam,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta & Fortune Ventures Worldwide Limited.
 
Hope everything is fine there.
 
Mam, I am still awaiting for the Bank Account.  Mr. Bruno had gone and given all the original copies
Mr. Raj Chott wanted. Days have passed  by there is still no news?? 
Kindly let me know what is the status now ???
 
To let you know : I have been granted Visa to UK for multiple entries for 2 years.
 
Apart from that ---we are yet to complete our website. Mr. Steve had sent me some designs. But I had told him to keep it on hold until I finally give him the design. Its a delay from my side. I am working on that.
 
Anything else that you would by chance want to guide us with --will be highly acknowledged.
 
Waiting for your reply at the earliest.
 
With best regards and compliments.
