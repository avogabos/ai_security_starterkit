Dear Steve,

Thank you for information. Unfortunately, this is not what I need.

I would like to order Global Merchant Starter Pack or Euro Trading Solution
and need your advice to select right solution for me.
I will be happy if you could answer to my below questions:

Is it possible to establish UK Company with offshore merchant account?

Which banks are you using for opening merchant accounts?

Are you charging your merchant’s customers when they pay by credit cards?
What is the payout period? Is it possible to get some part of payouts
during 2 or 3 days after payment?

Thanks,

Azar A
