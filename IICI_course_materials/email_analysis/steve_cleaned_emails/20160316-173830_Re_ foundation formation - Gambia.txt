Thanks for your rreply, I know the laws regarding foundations in both 
Nevis & Panama, but not Gambia, could you answer the following please

Is the foundation allowed to do limited trading (buy/sell shares, loan 
to beneficiaries, buy/leaseback business assets etc)?
Is the Founder allowed to be the sole council member, or the 
controller/overseer? (if not, how many council members should there be 
e.g Panama requires 3 & Nevis 1.
Does there have to be defined beneficiaries?
What information is reported to the local authorities?
What information is publicly available?

I help clients set up tax efficient business structures involving a 
Foundation + 2 or more offshore companies and I am looking to 
"outsource" (so to speak) the formations part to free up more of my time 
which means I need to know full information on any jurisdictions we use 
to ensure their suitability for each client (we act for businesses from 
SME size up to and including listed PLC's.

I look forward to your response.

Regards

Les Robinson
