Re: account confirmation
Hi
Steve,
I
had a talk over the phone with HMRC office in regards to Tax Reference Number
and they confirmed the status of this issue. In brief, they said that they had
already sent the letter containing that number to your office. May I know if
you can upload that letter online?
Another
question: I am still waiting for company documents to arrive and still there
are no information on that(I did check the postoffice today and nothing yet
arrived). May I know the date when you sent it? Any parcel number for tracking
it online?
Kind

Hi
Steve,
In
order to be able to go further with our startup ideas(in business), we would
like to be sure that our LTD company has a legitimate existence in the UK HMRC
office. As a confirmation, would you be able provide us with any valid
letter(with a company tax reference number on it) from HMRC?
Would
I be able to apply for business banking in UK(non-resident startup account)?
