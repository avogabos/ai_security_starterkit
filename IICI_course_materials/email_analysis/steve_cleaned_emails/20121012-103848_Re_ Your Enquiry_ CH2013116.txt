Dear Sir

Re: K2 ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS LIMITED    No. 7449178

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file
the following documents and fees:

1) Form RT01 together with the £100.00 filing fee.

2) The annual return for 30 November 2011, with a filing fee of
£40.00.

3) Accounts for the period ending 30 November 2011. There are no late
filing penalties payable for these accounts as they became due after the
company was dissolved.

4) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered
online at
http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/bvc14-administrative-restoration.aspx.

If you need any further help, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully
