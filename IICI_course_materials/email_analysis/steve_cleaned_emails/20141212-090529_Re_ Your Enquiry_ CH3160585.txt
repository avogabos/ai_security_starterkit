Dear Sir

EUROPEAN TRAVEL SERVICES INT. LIMITED 08462825

Thank you for your e mail concerning the restoration of the above company.

The company was dissolved on 20/05/2014 for non  filing of statutory documents.

There are two procedures for restoring a company to the register, which are:

   An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
      Order of Court to restore the company to the register.

If you wish to administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  The Bona Vacantia waiver letter, details can be found on the Treasury Solicitors
website https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bona-vacantia

3)  Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending 26/03/2014 and filing fee of £40.

The accounts for the period ending 31/03/2014 are due for filing by 26/12/2014.  If the company is not restored by this date these accounts will have to be filed as part of the restoration package.
,
If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court .

Information  regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website - ?http://www.tsol.gov.uk?  and http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk<http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/>
