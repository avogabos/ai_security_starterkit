Dear Bettina

Thank you for your patience and corporation, as you know that due to a technical issue our servers were down and our functioning was minimal but things are getting back to normal. Due to the fault we were not able to access whole of the information on company formation orders therefore we were not able to contact you earlier.

Please note that word KING is a sensitive word and to use the word you are required to obtain a NOC from the relevant body. Also we regret to inform you that company name was rejected because ‘KINGDOM HOLDINGS (UK)’ is considered to be the 'same as' one of the existing names already registered. Please provide alternate company names to that we can check the availability and process application with available company name.

Documents required for due diligence are as following:

Director and Shareholder:

2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (issue date, name, address and account number must be visible).
