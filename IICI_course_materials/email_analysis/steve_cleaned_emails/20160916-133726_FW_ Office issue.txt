Aquafina and nestle are both drunk in Africa and US and never an issue as
it's the same brand I drink there.

 

Not sure what brands are there, and obviously as we have just moved in there
and so we can now start getting some normal practise back.

 

Hopefully by  next week we can resolve the kitchenwares issue, and water, 

 

FELIX: Also perhaps consider the tone in how you Mr Fahad, I don't think
it's a way for you to speak to him. I expect everyone to treat each other
with politeness at all times

 

I know Steve also has many issues with salary and the move etc, but the
alternative was to end up with all of you losing your jobs altogether, so we
have had to find the funds to move offices and deal with the disruption. You
have worked for us for years and you know we are a better and fairer
employer than any other.

 

The other issues on late payments and commission is also close to resolve as
salaries were ontime and commissions 2 weeks later. The last 4 months
everything has been upside down but consider the last 5-10 years and how
things have been. In fact I take it almost personally that you cannot
understand the strain on all of us, every staff member and us in the UK,
where we too have huge commitments and I have personally put financial
guarantees in place for the contracts we are undertaking. 

 

I am fully aware of all the situations, but my focus is not on quick fixes
here and there, its making sure our company is not just stable but
flourishing. The FH business was stagnated for years before, and I have
worked hard with Rizwan, Fahad, Rehan, and all technical, sales, support and
all staff to move the company back towards a strong position. During the
process we have had set backs we never imagined would happen, but even on
the day of my fathers funeral, where was I after.. here in the office trying
to ensure we could keep moving forward.

 

Had we as a business not focused on the new contracts and development work,
Formations House would eventually plateau as a business and we wouldn't need
even half the staff we do. This isn't just FH that faces this, but many
companies in the UK and abroad. 

 

The new office is a big disruption but in fact a good one

We needed to move and be somewhere better for all staff

Slowly slowly everything to returning to normal.

Its been a tough year for us all

 

But lets not nit pick on problems, lets focus on solutions and working
together.

This is more than a company, we are a large extended family. And we all have
experience of people in families not sticking by eachother when they really
should, in fact my father passing proved who is and isn't my family, and im
glad that in many ways I discovered I had more people in my family who had
no other reason to be in it other than respect and care. Lets keep it that
way/

 

Water and kitchen will be fixed.

Mr Fahad has just so much on his plate at the moment, but he will get things
in order, and in fact I have to commend him and Rizwan, Rehan and Siddique
and Bilal, for getting so much done in such a short space of time

 

Anyone should feel they can approach me directly. 

 

Thanks

Charlotte

Charlotte,

 

We are facing some issues that need your attention. Please check the chat
below. The sales and support team would like to confirm the issues. Please
note that our office is in an area where you can get everything and these
days everything is a phone call away. We understand that it was a sudden
move and that the management has done a good job but the holidays are over
and by looking at the chat below it seems that he does not have a genuine
reason to give us sub standard water. Please look into it.
