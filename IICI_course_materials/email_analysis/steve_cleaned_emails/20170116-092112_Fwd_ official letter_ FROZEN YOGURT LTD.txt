Dear Steve,

we received from your support department this notification. I have some
questions.
What have we to do now ?
Why did we receive this penalty ?

I also need to know something else: we made two payments by T/T of euro
425,00 (17.02.2015 on HSBC account) and GBP 300,00 (19.10.2015 on Santander
UK account). As I cannot find any trace of them on your website, can you
email me the reason of them ?

Sure of ready reply, kindest regards

Massimiliano Iadecicco
