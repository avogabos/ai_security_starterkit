Dear Steve.

 

I forward you email from your company (see you bellow).  Advise me, please, what it happen? I haven´t received any notice about it, I mean, that I dont know, that I havent submitted annual returns….I think, that I have resolved from the last.

 

Thank you for your help.

 

PS: I paid your services via Invoice Order No.:187117 today.

 

Best regards
