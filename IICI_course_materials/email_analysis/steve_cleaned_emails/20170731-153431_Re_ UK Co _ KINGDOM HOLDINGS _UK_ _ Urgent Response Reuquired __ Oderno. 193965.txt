Hi again Steve,


Could you please send us the documents for Malku Holdings via email? I talked to someone in your office that said our company was incorporated on July 27, 2017. However, we have not received any information regarding this.


Thank you and kind regards,

Bettina

Dear Steve,



Reference is made to your email dated July 21, 2017.



Could you please check the availability of the name "Malku Holdings (UK) Ltd.".



Please find attached herewith a scanned copy of Michael Miller's passport, and a recent utility bill. Mr. Miller will be the Director and Shareholder of the company, as well as the PSC.



The company is being established in order for Mr. Miller to make personal investments. He will be opening a bank account in the UK in order to facilitate this. There will be no annual turnover for the company, as it is basically a holding company, not an operating business.



We are unsure what SIC Code should be used. Could you provide us with a phone contact so that we can discuss this with you?



Thank you and kind regards,

Bettina
