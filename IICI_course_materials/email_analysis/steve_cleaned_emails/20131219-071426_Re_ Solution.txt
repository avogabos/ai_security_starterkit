Steve,

The bank says the cards are all fine. And the Balance are way above what's
required. And the credit card which we tried yesterday is the same one we
used for our US company formation.

We have used several other gateways for online shopping and we do it on a
regular basis. I'm not sure why it's not going through in your gateway. I
used my card today to do some shopping for x-mas too.

Anyways we will try the bank transfer now. No other way it seems like.

Steve,
I just spoke with my bank and they said that the payments
are not going through because of the new RBI regulation. The new regulation
says that no international transaction can be done over 50,000 INR. And even if
we are trying 495 GBP, it's not going through as the bank inter-exchange rate
is 102 INR/GBP hence 495 GBP is also over 50,000 INR.
They said ask Formation House to Break down the order of 545
pounds into two parts and both payment shall go through without any hassle.
Can you please remove all orders from the dashboard and
create 2 orders like one of 345 GBP and another of 200 GBP? or 400 GBP and 145
GBP?
We will be able to complete the procedure during UK evening
time today in that case.
Please let me know the feasibility.
Regards,
Pratik Roy
