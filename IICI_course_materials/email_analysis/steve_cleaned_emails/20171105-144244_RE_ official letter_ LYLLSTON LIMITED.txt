Dear Sir,

 

As we received your email with the attached letter from Companies House,

May we remind you that we sent our transaction details to the Account Centre
on the 18th of October.

 

Could you tell us if all the figures we gave you are correct and when can we
expect to have a draft of the balance.

Thank you,
