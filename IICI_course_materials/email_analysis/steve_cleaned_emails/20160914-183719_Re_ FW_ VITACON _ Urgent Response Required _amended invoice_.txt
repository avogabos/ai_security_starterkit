Dear Steve,

Please accept the KYC of Mrs Natalia Bratushenko.

As per latest invoice sent by you in  total amount of  565 pounds, 
kindly note that we would like to send 630 pounds instead,
because you forgot to mention courier delivery charges  for the second 
company which will be registered shortly.

Please be so kind to revise the invoice by adding 65 pounds.


Looking forward hearing from you.
Best regards,
Victoria Becker
