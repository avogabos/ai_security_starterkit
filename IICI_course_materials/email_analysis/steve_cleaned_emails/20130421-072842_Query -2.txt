Hi Steve

Another thing I'd like to know in the whole situation of UK LLP before
starting it is the following.

If partners who start LLP (1) include some bills of exchange (tratta) in
equity capital in a moment of formation or (2) buy these bills after their
LLP was formed or (3) receive them in exchange for something - what are UK
regulations/restrictions for doing so?

Sorry for asking questions which are probably sound complicated but I
really want to know an adequate answer at least for the (1) of them before
starting procedure.

If it is difficult for you to provide answers could you give some advise
where to get them?

Best regards,
Eugene
