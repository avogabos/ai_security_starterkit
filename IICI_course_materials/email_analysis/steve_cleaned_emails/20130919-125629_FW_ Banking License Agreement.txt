You need to change the total cost in the agreement to reflect the actual
pricing

 

You seemed to miss items

 

And with chin- he wanted a discount for ordered at once, which I gave, but
then he turned around and wanted staged payments

This means we ended up under charging him and we wont make much profit of
that at all

 

I do not want that situation again

It needs to be clear what is being paid
