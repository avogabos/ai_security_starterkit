Good afternoon Oliver,

Thanks for taking my call this morning and giving me the chance to speak with you about my company needs,  

Right now we are looking for an offshore company solution whereby we can open a bank account with on line privileges to be able to receive funds from a merchant processor and wire those funds to our marketing partners in India.  Along with establishing all of this, we need a merchant processing account for VISA and Mastercard, using a virtual terminal. 

I was looking at your packages and saw that you have a set up in Gambia that includes all of these features, however, I'd appreciate you considering what the best course of action would be for us.  

With regards,
