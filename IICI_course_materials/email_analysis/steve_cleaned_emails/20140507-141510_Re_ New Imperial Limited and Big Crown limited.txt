Dear Steve,

Thanks a lot for your email. Could you please clarify financial issues 
before I contact beneficial owners. I have to make them clear offer that 
includes information on outstanding financial issues. They paid USD 
1,635 each for Gambian companies and other services. However, according 
to their calculations each of the beneficial owner received services on 
USD 310. Therefore, both of them have positive balance equal to USD 1,325.

I look forward to hearing from you asp.

Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Steve,
Thank you very much for your email.
Could you please indicate what would be 'the additional
            cost' for a UK company
            provided that our clients has only received certificates of
            incorporation,
            M&As and shares certificates (all documents in
            electronic format).
            Therefore, they received services only for USD310. Other
            services/documents had
            been paid according to the attached invoices but were not
            received in fact.
Is it possible to buy this company as shelf ones provided
            that our clients will
            provide names of shareholders and directors later?
Best regards,
Andrei
