Dear Mr Smith

ANTONIO MICELI FOOD LIMITED

 Thank you for your e-mail of 17 January 2017 concerning the restoration of the above company.

I can confirm the company was dissolved for non filing of statutory documents.

There are two procedures for restoring a companies to the register which are:
             - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
             - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

 If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

 1) RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.00

 2) The BV waiver letter. This can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

3) Annual Return form for the date of 4 June 2016 with a filing fee of £40.00.

 Having checked our records there are no outstanding late filing penalties due.

Please note the Accounts for the period ending 30 June 2016 will be due by 4 March 2017.  If the company is not restored by this due date, these Accounts will need to be filed, as part of the restoration application.  

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

 A Claim Form CPR (Part 8), and a witness statement stating details of  who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register  and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court.

 Information regarding this can be found on the Government Legal Department website https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-company-restoration  and http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk .

 If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to  incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may  use the same name. This option can be cheaper, as there are only the  incorporation fees payable.

 Yours faithfully
 Sara Walter
