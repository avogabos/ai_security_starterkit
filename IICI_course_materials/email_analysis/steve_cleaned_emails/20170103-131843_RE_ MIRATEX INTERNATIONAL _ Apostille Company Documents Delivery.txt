Hi Nadya

 

How are you? How were the holidays?

 

This client, she gave her contact number incorrect, is there any way you can
contact ITS courier to correct the number because there is no ITS in Moldova
so in transit the courier company will change to DHL and if they call her
she will not get the call. Correct no. is +372-57-39-21-76.

 

And if ITS can give us they tracking number DHL will issue?

Thanks!
