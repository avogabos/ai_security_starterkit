Hi Steve,

Despite paying for mail forwarding service, we have yet to receive any mail
from you.  We are aware that statutory mail would have been sent to the
registered office since its incorporation in 2013.  We have recently
requested information from Companies House which would have been sent to
you in the last couple of weeks but we have not received same.

Would you please look into this as a matter of urgency.

Thank you.

Elaine.
