Hello Steve

Its unfortunate that we are waiting since 1 year to have the whole process  
completed.

We didn't receive bank account and other stuffs we paid for so far. In  
this respect please cancel all process and make a full refund to us. We  
will find another supplier that can provide the services.

My colleagues has sent you three previous emails in this respect without  
answers, we expected better results from www.formationshouse.com.

Should my email here remain without answers i would have no other  
alternative than report the matter to various scam review  websites..

regards
Sunil Gohin
