Voluntary Strike Offs
Dear Steve,
Prior 
                              to the commencement of The Companies Act, 2014 the 
                              procedure for having companies struck off, on a 
                              voluntary basis, was entirely at the discretion 
                              of the Registrar of Companies. As such, this process 
                              evolved over time as the Registrar added to the 
                              requirements as different issues presented themselves.
However, with the commencement of the Companies 
                              Act 2014 the procedures for having a company struck 
                              off on a voluntary basis have now been committed 
                              to statute and are unambiguous. The ability for 
                              a voluntary strike off to be halted has been formalised, 
                              as has the option for creditors to object to a strike 
                              off.
My colleague, Sue Jesper, has prepared a Factsheet 
                              on the new procedures and that is available by clicking

With the 30th September Annual Return Date favoured 
                              by the vast majority of companies rapidly approaching, 
                              NOW would be a good time to review the companies 
                              under your administration to see if any should be 
                              struck off before this date.
If so, please contact Sue, Sandra or myself and 
                              we will be delighted to assist.
Yours sincerely,
Sean
