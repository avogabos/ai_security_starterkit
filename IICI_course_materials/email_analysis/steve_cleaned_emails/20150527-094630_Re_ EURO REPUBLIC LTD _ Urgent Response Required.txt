Hi Steve,

Thank you again for the clarification. If that is the case, kindly proceed
with Natural Person Nominee Director GBP 500.

Regarding the notarized documents, I already provided Proof of ID - Valid
Passport & Proof of Residential Address - latest personal bank statement
for the past 3 months. Do let me know what kind of documents do you need
since we are proceeding with Natural Person Nominee Director GBP 500.

Thank you.

Hi Leonard
If you are appointing Natural Person Nominee Director GBP 500 then
you cannot appoint your own director. And at the time of bank account opening
you will need to remove Natural Person Nominee Director and Nominee Shareholder
and appoint your own.
What we can do is we appoint your own director and shareholder
in Nominee Director GBP 400 service in which we will register an offshore
company for your in Seychelles. And as mentioned in our previous email for this
purpose we will need NOTARIZED documents, proof of id and proof of address for
company director and shareholder.
Please advice.
