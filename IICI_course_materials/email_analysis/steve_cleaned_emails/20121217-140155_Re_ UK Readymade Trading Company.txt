Dear Steve,

Thank you for your e-mail, we need to know what the company name is and the
company number. As you know Thomas requested a company with a *trading
history* this is essential. He would like to check this to ensure it meets
the requirements. It also needs to be a company which was involved
in finances.

Many Thanks

*Administration.*
