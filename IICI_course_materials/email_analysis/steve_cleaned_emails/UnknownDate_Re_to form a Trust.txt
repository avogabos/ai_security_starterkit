Dear Mr Jaafar,
In order to best offer the right solution we would like to ask the following information:
1. What will the purpose of the trust be
2. Will the trust operate as a business at all
3. Who will be the settlor and who will the beneficiaries be..
4. The trustee will be responsible for the management of the trust assets. Can you briefly explain what the assets what be, and whether there will be a paid up capital entered in the trust within the first 3 months of formation?
5. Where is the trustee domiciled
A Trust can be formed is 2 ways. One is usually as a non profit company with a clearly defined deed for operating. The other is not an incorporated company in the sense of your intention for it, It is a legal agreement and usually requires the services of a Trust solicitor.
We are not Solicitors and therefore cannot provide point 4 explicitly. However we can provide a letter that states the law relating the company regulations of a trust. The Trust deed should ideally also be registered with a solicitor or trust account who specialises in trust management – we are able to provide a suitable legal contact for this. In terms of our own compliance and data protection policies, we will not disclose any information to any party unless it is a UK government authorised disclosure request.
We can state our typically fees for a non profit incorporation are £1500 however you are expected to provide the trust deed/ charitable deed. These types of incorporation require 2 trustees at least.
Depending on the answers to the above we can give a clearer price or definitve solution to offer.

Steve Smith
