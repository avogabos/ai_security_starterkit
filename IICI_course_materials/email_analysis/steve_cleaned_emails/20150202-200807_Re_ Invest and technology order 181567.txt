Dear Steve,
In the letter you send me there was only certificate of
incorporation.
No Notarized POA, No Notarized set of company documents and nothing
actually.
Please fix that ASAP and send me the Number of the package. The
clients are under a lot of pressure to deliver what was promised and paid for.
Best,
Ronny
