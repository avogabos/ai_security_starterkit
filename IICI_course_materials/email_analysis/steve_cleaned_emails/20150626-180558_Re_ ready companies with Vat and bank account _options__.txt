Hello Steve,
Sorry if I'm coming to your contact only now. (I appreciate very much your
cooperation)
I may be interested in your "Managed Tax System" (I think I'll be able to
decide on Monday or Thursday)
(it can be for a simple transction similar to this one:
- Company A sells a product/service (one invoice) to your UK Company and
this one sells that same product/service (one invoice) to the Company B.
  (A + B are Vat registered European companies (with VIES for euro
community trade/services) like your UK company - compatible to European Vat)
The amount may be of 10 thousand euros, but it can be of almost 40 thousand
euros - I'm waiting for some informations to know it for sure.
Is it okay for you?
About another part of our emails, I have two simple questions:
- Can I buy a ready-made company from your list (it says they all are Ltd
companies) and change it at once to an LLP?
- Can you provide a registered office in Scotland (Edinburgh, or else) for
this LLP (I would prefer a Scottish entity).
  (I have two US corporate members/partners - non resident in UK - for this
partnership) - Also: no need for Vat in this case.
Can we do it?
Bank account is possible for this? (even if I must go to UK).
Also: which options (additional services - basic) should I select in the
request in your website, after buying the chosen ready-made company?

Re: ready companies with Vat and bank account (options)+
Hi, Steve.
About the shelf companies with bank accounts:
- the problem is that they have no Vat to trade immediately
(and the Vat registration takes 2 to 4 weeks...,
almost as long as the bank account in a foreign
country - outside Europe...St Vincent);
About the ready made solutions:
- I think it can be a solution (having time/history of
incorporation) but with 2 to 4 weeks for Vat registration,
and 4 to 6 weeks for the bank account, it's too long
for this period (and what I need).
Have you got a different solution for the bank account? (not
UK and not St. Vincent - it's too long. And/Or,
Have you got a solution for an immediate process and invoice
(a few days), even if I would make an order
of a ready-made company? (from 2014, or less), with Vat
register and a quick bank account?
The service you refer as ITS - Instant Trading Solution
would be suitable for this?
(in this case £1.500 will pay this service along with an
order of an Ltd UK company with Vat and account?)
Could you tell me more about it? (I which to have an UK Ltd
or LLP in a buy and sell process this month)
Thanks. Best regards,
Antonio
