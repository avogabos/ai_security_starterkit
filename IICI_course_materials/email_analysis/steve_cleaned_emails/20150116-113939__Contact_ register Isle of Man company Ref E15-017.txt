Dear James and Steve

Thank you for this introduction,  we can provide formation services, but we need to understand exactly what the company is to do and also who the owners will be.  We also should have sight of the legal and tax advice that proposed an Isle of Man company so we can understand what it is to do and what its purpose in the overall structure will be. 

I attach our standard new business forms which will have to be completed to satisfy our due diligence requirements before we can commence the provision of services.  Please ensure that they are completed with as much information as is available.  Once we understand the role and purpose of the company we can then provide a fee proposal.

I would, however, just mention that we can provide directors, but under IOM company law, they will have full responsibility for the management and control of the company; there is not a position of nominee director under company law. 

Kind regards


Heather Kent

Dear Steve,
Please note we now don't normally  get directly involved with Isle of Man Company formations due to the onerous local compliance rules.
It is much better to use a locally registered agent for the Isle of Man.

We recommend Trident Trust and have copied in our local contact Heather Kent.

Thank you
James
