Hello Steve,

next month I'll open a new company in London with my 2 colegues, we have
one IT startup, so we would like to start this business from London.

As you probably know, it's impossible without UK bank account, and as I
know, it's impossible to get business account without good enough personal
UK credit history of directors/owners.

So, we have no UK credit history because we can't have it, and we can't get
it without bank account there, so it's a magic circle where is no way out.

How sure you can be, in case we open a new company with your office, that
you will provide us a successful service regarding a bank account (regular
UK account, not offshore)?

What do you think about the name LOYALAP LIMITED, is there a problem to get
this name if there already exist similar name LOYAL APP LIMITED? (We have
one word and that company has two words with one P more)

Best regards,

Slavko Ples
