Hi Steve:

We have received confirmation that each of Argentum, Eventus and Oxbridge
have been formed.    Where do we get information on the nominee directors,
officers and shareholder.   Also when do we get copies of the articles of
association and memorandum.

I take it that each nominee shareholder, officer and director will be
giving a power of attorney.   When will we be in receipt of such
documents.

Which address have they been sent to.    Finally, will these documents
suffice to open corporate accounts where we already have banking
relationships

Karim
