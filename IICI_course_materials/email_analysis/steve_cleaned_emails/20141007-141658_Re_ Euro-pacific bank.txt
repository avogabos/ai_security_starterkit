Hi Steve

Thanks for the feedback.

My partners and I trade and broker IT equipment (hardware and software) 
globally. We operate two companies for this business. Since we are 
physically in South Africa, we have a South African registered company 
whose sole purpose is to provide this brokering service to our UK 
registered Inforbis Ltd. In other words, my partners and I close deals 
from Cape Town, South Africa. The details of the deal are then passed on 
to our UK company to be fully processed and handled. The UK company then 
pays a commission fee to the South African company for finding the deal.

The Euro-Pacific bank account is needed for the UK registered Inforbis 
Ltd strictly for paying suppliers, receiving money from customers, and 
paying commission to us in South Africa, as well as paying any other 
related operating costs.

Gradually, profits from deals will accumulate in the Euro-Pacific bank 
account. We are very interested in exploring investment opportunities 
offered by Euro-Pacific.

If there are any other questions in regards to our business activites, 
please don't hesitate to ask.

Re: Euro-pacific bank
Hi Steve
The total cost is more than £500 for
                us since there are Apostille documents, etc. that we
                need prepared by you and as a start-up, it all adds up,
                but that's all manageable. We just want to know what the
                chances of success are so I would really appreciate an
                answer the following questions from my last email.
We realise that the decision is the bank's in the end,
                but what is your total track record of successful
                applications at Euro-Pacific bank? What is your track
                record of successful applications for citizens of South
                Africa at Euro-Pacific bank, if there have been such
                applications in the past?
Thank you Steven.

Hi David
The bank
              account opening service cost is 500 GBP.
The CV for
              company director/s is required because the bank need to
              know the occupation of company director, which companies
              director have worked with and in what position.
Interview
              will be given by bank once application is submitted.
              Questions will be regarding company director occupation,

Euro-pacific bank
Hi Steve
My partners and I want to proceed with opening a bank
              account at Euro-Pacific Bank. Since the total fees for
              this service are quite significant, we'd like to ask a few
              more questions.
One of the requirements was that we have CVs ready. How
              comprehensive must this CV be? What does the bank need our
              CVs for? How many years prior to today should the CV
              account for, if not full history/lifelong CV? We'd like to
              know in order to complete the best possible version.
When it is time for the skype interview with the
              Euro-Pacific bank, will you prepare us for it? What kind
              of questions should we expect?
What is your total track record of successful applications
              at Euro-Pacific bank? What is your track record of
              successful applications for citizens of South Africa at
              Euro-Pacific bank?
Please reply to all cc'd addresses, those are my partners.
