I am not interested in doing business in Gambia, I am interested in having a
Limited Liability PLL company in Germany. Do you have a ready made company
in Germany? Do you have to registered a new company in Germany? Can you
transferred the existence company? Can I have an operation office for my
business in Germany? How much will it cost me?. Please response.  Best
regards,
