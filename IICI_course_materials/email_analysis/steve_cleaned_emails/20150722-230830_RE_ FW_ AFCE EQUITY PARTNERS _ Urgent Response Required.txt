Dear Steve,
in the attachment the new passport of "Mr HASSAN IBRAHIM HASSAN ALI". I have verified and in general
the Egyptian Passaport has not the signature. Tell me if you need  integrations.
Another thing. In the Uk limited "H & T PROTFOLIO MANAGERS"  I need to have the visibility of the new shareholders in the Company House online (Form Ar01?)
Thank you
Regards
Andrea
