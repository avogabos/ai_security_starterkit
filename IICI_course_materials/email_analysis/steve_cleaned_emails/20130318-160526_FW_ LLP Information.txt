Dear Chris and Alex,

Thank you for coming in to see us to discuss your new business. I have
enclosed the details regarding the LLP structure as discussed.

I propose this Onshore/Offshore structure as it will provide the UK legal
entity often required for business contracts and validity (trust) with other
businesses worldwide. The LLP is a flexible structure enabling you to add
more partners as time goes on which may other corporate entities (branches
for instance) based in other countries. 

The members of a UK LLP do not have to reside in the UK. In many cases a
corporate body residing in an offshore jurisdiction will act as the member.
This enables the beneficial ownership of the LLP in the UK to retain a high
degree of anonymity as well as provide other tax advantages.

Each member can be setup as a Seychelles LTD company, each with a single
director and shareholder. Each Seychelles Company can have its own bank
account in an offshore jurisdiction such as Cyprus and the director may have
direct access online, via cards and in person to the account. Current
concerns in Cyprus relating to the Levy on bank accounts should  not concern
new businesses wishing to open accounts there, as this levy is currently on
existing private accounts and business accounts with more than £100k on
deposit. We are told this levy is a one off measure and so do not expect it
to affect future business bank accounts. We can look at other jurisdictions
to open the account but many other jurisdictions hold strongly to the EU Tax
Treaty or do not like anonymous companies. 

A Limited Liability Partnership, LLP, is a type of business entity
registered in the UK. Like a Private Limited company (LTD) it is considered
as a corporate body with a separate legal entity. In addition, the liability
of its members is limited to their contributions only.

The primary difference between an LLP and an LTD is that a UK LLP can
operate as Fiscally Transparent. This means that any taxes on profits are
levied on the members of the Partnership and not on the Partnership itself.
The rate of tax levied on the members of the partnership is dependent upon
each members tax residency. This can become a significant advantage if the
members of the partnership are tax resident in a low or nil tax jurisdiction
as profits can be redistributed tax efficiently. 

Limited Liability Partnerships do not have directors and shareholders, they
only have partners. Each partner can be given limited liability and can be
protected from responsibility or liability for another partners misconduct
or negligence. All partners have the right to manage the LLP and at least 1
partner must be designated as the Nominated Partner.

In addition, an LLP may open a UK bank account and apply for a VAT number.
To open the account the bank will request the Nominated member to be present
(or the director of the corporate body acting as nominated member), in some
cases the bank will want all members present but it shouldnt be a problem.

The Seychelles members can also operate as businesses in their own right and
are useful where you may be signing contracts that trade outside of the UK.

In summary, an LLP setup with 2 offshore members provides a high level of
flexibility, anonymity and efficiency. 

What we provide

*	Hard copy Certificate of Incorporation 
*	The Partnership Agreement after your LLP is formed 
*	Online PDF versions of company documents 

In addition as detailed in the attached ProForma Invoice, we can provide the
Seychelles incorporations, the bank accounts and other supporting services.

 

Let me know if you require any thing further or wish to proceed.

 

Kind Regards,
