Hi

Thanks for this

Please can you let me know as soon as it has been reset

Also please see attached reference letter from Barclays - if I send you this original letter will it suffice or does it need to be on letter headed paper?

Matt

If you could fill in with the following details that would be great:

.
The company has a growing client base across East Africa, and revenue streams from Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa, Botswana, and Uganda. The company also solicits business online globally.
Please can you update the form and let me know once this has been completed - please get back to me ASAP
Also can you supply me with the address to send the hard copy documents to?
