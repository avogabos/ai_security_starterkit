Hi Sarah

 

We have being trying to enter the details on the Bank Form for both MC
Capital and Gatex but when you click save and go back to the form all the
information is lost.

 

Is there something wrong with your system or are we doing something wrong.

 

If we still can't save it can I email this information to you?

 

Thanks

Chris
