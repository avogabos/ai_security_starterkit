Re: EMB - Non Trading Company filing
Hi Steve,
Payment was done last Friday from my bank account. It went
immediately into your account.
Can you have it confirmed on your side ?
I did the transfer on internet and cannot see how I could
provide you with a proof of payment.
Please advise
Kind regards
Catherine

Re: EMB - DCA filing
Dear
Oliver,
Ok this
is clear.
Just
one last question: do you confirm that EMB qualifies for Dormant Company as
-
the cy has not traded
- BUT
EMB has made expenses (eg IT costs).
If EMB
qualifies for DCA filing, then I will have the money transfered to your account
(75GBP) and you will be able to go ahead.
Many
thanks for your kind help

Dear

DCA
filing is 75 GBP
If you

we file this company as dormant (non trading)
In
the UK.
If
you want us to prepare accounts using your transactions that you have sent to
me, and then file them to companies house
It is
filing trading accounts
·
DCA
filing is 75 GBP
·
Trading
accounts filing is 500 GBP
I
hope it is now clear to you

Dear

you mentioned
previously that it would be only 75 GBP for DCA filing.
Is there a typo in your last email where you mention 500 GBP?
Please
