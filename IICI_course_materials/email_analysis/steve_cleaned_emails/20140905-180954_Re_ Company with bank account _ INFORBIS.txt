Dear Steve
Thanks for the details. We will go ahead with applying for a UK
company registration first. As soon as we prepare all the required
documents, we will also go ahead with the Euro Pacific bank account opening.
We have three shareholders for the company. All of us are South
African citizens. Two of us have the passports that you require for
identification. One of us is in the process of applying for a
passport, which might take about two months. Is it possible to use
our internal identification document called a South African ID book?
It is the only legitimate document, along with a passport, that can
be used for official purposes in the country. If this South African
ID book is acceptable, we will be spared the wait for the passport.
In regards to proof of residence documents, our electricity is
purchased through a prepaid meter and the water is included in the
rent, so we do not have statements of those utilities. We do not
get billed for gas as a utility in South Africa. We can, however,
provide statements for our monthly rent payments. Will that work?
Can you please specify what documents exactly are required in the
apostille set of company documents?

David

The Euro-Pacific Bank in St Vincent sounds good.
Since the approval depends on the bank entirely, will you prepare us for the Skype interview?
Please send me a quote for registering a limited company in the UK and opening a Euro Pacific Bank account. How long does this process take? What would you need from us? What does the bank need from us?
I'm happy with this option. When you send the quote, I will discuss this with my partners and we'll probably go ahead.

Dear Steve
Thanks for the information.
In regards to the offshore banking options: none of the directors are US citizens or residents, but are there any limitations for paying or receiving funds from the US? We do it rarely.
Do you mean that the Latvian bank requires a director that lives in Europe?
Do all these offshore bank accounts allow for international SWIFT banking online?
Does the Delaware LLC + bank account option from restrict me for paying and receiving payments in the US? Do you offer this option?
What other banks globally will open a bank account for us without requiring residency or a visit to the branch and have no restrictions on the geography of transactions (receiving + making payments) especially in regards to the US?
