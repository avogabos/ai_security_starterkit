Dear Customer


Unfortunately your bank account opening application was rejected by FBME
Cyprus. The reason for rejection is that banks world over have temporarily
stopped entertaining applications for Gambia companies.


However we are still engaged with ECO Bank Gambia to resolve the issues and
are hopeful that we will come to a successful conclusion soon.


I will keep you updated on the progress and as soon we are on board, we will
start processing the Gambia Bank Accounts for Gambian companies.


Thank you for your co-operation.


Regards

Steve

The branch is in Cyprus but it is not a Cyprus bank, so they are not
affected by the current conditions in Cyprus.
