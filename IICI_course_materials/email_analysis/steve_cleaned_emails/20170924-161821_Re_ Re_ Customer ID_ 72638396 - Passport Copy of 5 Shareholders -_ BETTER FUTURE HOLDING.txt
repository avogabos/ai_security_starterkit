Dear Steve,

Sorry that was my fault, I already asked the bank to insert all the
residential address in the statement as well, please find the attachment
for all 5 members and directors including full names, residential address,
bank account and current date of issue.

Thanks for your corporation and support.

Regards
Ashkan
