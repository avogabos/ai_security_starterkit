Dear Steve Smith,

In my knowledge, i learned that for registering too much companies one
registered address needed. But i learned that for VAT registration
separate trading address is needed. So, if i order for VAT, which
trading address you will be able to use for my company?

Thanks & Regards,
Najbudheen Pottachira
