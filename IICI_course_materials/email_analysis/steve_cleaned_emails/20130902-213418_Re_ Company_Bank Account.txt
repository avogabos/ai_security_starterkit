Dear Steve,

Before doing business with Formations House I will need information on the company:

How long have you been in business?
Where is the company registered, who is the CEO?
Do you have past clients recommendations?
There are so many scams about these days that I need to be sure this is all legitimate and that I won't lose 295GBP
I will also need information on yourself as I need to know who I am doing business with.

If possible, I would like to pay by PayPal as this is a safe way of paying.

Many thanks,

Yoni Cohen
