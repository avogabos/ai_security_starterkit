Dear Mr.
Steve,

 

Greetings
from Siddhartha Das Gupta.

 

Thanks for
the mail.

 

Kindly do
note that you may drop ( cancel) the idea of  the making of the Business
Cards. 

There are
2 reasons for it :

1. You
have written that you  informed that as per terms you can print one side
only. That's fine , but it would not serve my purpose.

   
so better not do it and please note I do not require any refund or credits for the
cancellation.

2. I have
done our business cards from London only today --- Just for your information I
have got it designed , printed and delivered within 

   
two hours only, that too excellent quality and design.  I feel may be
that your company is tied up with the wrong people.

 

I will try
to send you a copy of the Business Cards and letter heads and a designer cup
which I have done today. I am sure you will love to see the work and the
concept. 


I am
sending you the design of the Logo of our company , freshly for your designing
purpose . Kindly open the attachment sent herewith and forward it to your
designing team. You
have to open it with Corel Draw . I am sure your designing team
will have the software.



 

I had
requested for a contact number or the contact person who will do the designing
, kindly keep a note of that and let me know.

I would
not like to waste time for designing not as per my mind set.

 

So far the
accounting package is concerned , its O.K , kindly send it when it is done.

 

Take care.



 



With sincere compliments & best
wishes....
