Dear Customer

 

 

This is to inform you that due an unfortunate incident we have suspended our
bank account service with ECO Bank Gambia.

 

 

We are setting up with a Latvian bank to process your bank account and
merchant account. Please allow a week for us to update our position with the
new bank.

 

 

I will be out of office till 4th October 2013. For further queries you can
email directly to support@formationshouse.com

 

 

Regards

 

Steve
