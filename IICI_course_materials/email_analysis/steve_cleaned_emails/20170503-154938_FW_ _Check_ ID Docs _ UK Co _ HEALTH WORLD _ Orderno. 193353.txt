Hi Michael,

 

Sorry the risk of forgery/other issues is too high. The customer must have a utility bill or something else we accept to confirm their home address?

 

Thanks,

Elliot

Order No. 193353

 

Please find attached the documents for the director. The bank statement does not contain her residence address. However, the cheque contains the address so she has provided the cheque as confirmation. Please advise if this is acceptable as a valid proof of address. OR would we need to request for a valid proof of address.

 

Awaiting your reply in this regard. 

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Michael Gomes

Please get the attach documents checked, meanwhile I will get the other information.

 

Attach is the driving license, bank statement and cheques. Bank statement do not have the address therefore client has sent copies of cheque which have director’s address on it.
