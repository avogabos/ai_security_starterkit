Hi Steve,

Thanks for the information -
If you don't mind here are a few questions for you:
1. Can we establish a non-trading company/Dormant Company?
2. Establishing a non-trading company/dormant company - do you provide the
following documents: a business license? Articles of
Incorporation/Organization? Articles of Association?


Thanks,
Limor
