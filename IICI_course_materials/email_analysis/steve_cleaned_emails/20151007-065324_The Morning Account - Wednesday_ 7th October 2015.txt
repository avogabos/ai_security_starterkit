EU targets sweetheart tax deals
Sweetheart tax deals between multinational companies and EU nations will be subject to greater scrutiny after finance ministers agreed to boost information sharing in response to the LuxLeaks scandal. Yesterday’s deal will require finance ministries to exchange information on tax rulings with each other automatically, without any need for a request. It is the first major step to be agreed by the EU since leaked documents revealed last year that Luxembourg had issued hundreds of tax rulings that allowed companies to lower their tax bills by channelling profits through the Grand Duchy. The law will take effect at the start of 2017, although data on past deals will also have to be shared. “This is a major step in combating aggressive tax planning, creating greater transparency in corporate taxation and in providing fairer competition for both businesses and consumers,’’ Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner in charge of tax policy, said.

Anti-avoidance victory for HMRC
A tribunal victory by HMRC means the Revenue can apply anti-avoidance laws retrospectively, with property developers and IT contract workers facing tax bills of more than £100,000 as a result. More than 2,000 people are liable for tax demands totalling £200m, after using schemes that were legal in the 2000’s – but which have now been banned - to avoid paying income tax. British workers had previously been able to legally set up an offshore partnership in the Isle of Man in order to reduce their rate of income tax to just 5%, but the Government closed the loophole in its "double-tax" agreement with the dependency in the 2008 Finance Act. Last month a judge ruled in tribunal documents published this week that the Revenue could retrospectively enforce the legislation to force workers to pay backdated taxes.

Osborne facing tax credit pressure
Boris Johnson and other leading Conservatives are calling on George Osborne to accelerate plans to raise the personal tax allowance in order to soften the impact of cuts to tax credits. Some cabinet ministers have joined Tory backbenchers in warning that the Government will face a backlash when 3.2m people are told that their state-funded wage top-ups will be reduced next April. It comes as David Cameron defended Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt after he suggested that cuts to tax credits would motivate Britons to work as hard as people in China. Speaking on BBC Radio 5, Mr Cameron said Mr Hunt had been saying he wanted the UK to be “one of the great success stories of the 21st century”. He added: “So I think he has been rather unfairly misinterpreted, but these things happen.” Meanwhile, Iain Duncan Smith has said the tax credit reforms will show parents that "children cost money" and discourage them from having too many.

OECD praised
Kevin Nicholson Head of Tax, PwC, writes to the FT to suggest that anyone who doubted the OECD’s tax reform project would deliver meaningful change has been “proved wrong.” He says some of the most contentious measures have received broad approval from the participating countries and many global businesses are reviewing their operating models. But he adds that much work still remains.

Asset Finance comeback complete
The Times’ Asset Finance supplement claims the “comeback of asset finance is complete,” with data from the Finance & Leasing Association revealing its members provided £27.1bn of asset finance to businesses over the year to the end of June. That exceeded the industry's peak before the financial crisis of £26.7bn. On the subject of SME funding, the supplement notes that asset finance has provided a much needed lifeline as banks remain cautious lenders. Lombard MD Ian Cowie points out that although lot has been said about the availability of finance to support growth by SMEs, Lombard still approves nine out of ten deals. And Mike Francis, head of asset finance at Investec, states: "For many high street banks it is simply not economic to lend sums of less than £50,000 on a stand-alone basis. There needs, therefore, to be a serious shake-up in the approach SMEs take towards securing funding.” Asset Finance also details the introduction of the annual investment allowance and highlights the CBI’s growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016, which suggest businesses as a whole are intending to increase investment by 6.5% next year.

Tesco promises prompter payments for SMEs
Tesco is promising better terms for its suppliers, following recent claims that it delays payments and breaches industry rules routinely. Chief executive Dave Lewis has announced that smaller suppliers, who deliver up to £100,000 worth of products in a year, will be paid within 14 days from next June - more than a month faster than before. And medium-sized suppliers, who deliver up to £10m in product a year, will have their accounts settled in 23 days - five days quicker than larger suppliers. At the same time, Tesco has said George Osborne's "national living wage" will cost it £500m by 2020.

Few pension savers cashing in
Standard Life says far fewer people reaching retirement than expected are cashing in their pension pots to spend on other items. The firm said only 6% of eligible customers have made use of the government’s pension freedom reforms since they were introduced on April 6, with the rest choosing not to touch their pension pots and to keep their money invested. Meanwhile, Prudential says it is scrapping its advice requirement for savers who have at least £25,000 for the Pension Choices plan.

The impossible job?
The Guardian’s Denis Campbell says the NHS is in a leadership crisis because running hospitals has become near-impossible. He says health care trusts are haemorrhaging chief executives who are under pressure to balance the books and deliver high-quality care. He cites Dame Gill Morgan, chair of NHS Providers, who states that the number of chief executive leaving the NHS illustrates the “real and increasing pressures” that trust bosses now face. Mr Campbell also notes that finance directors are also becoming casualties of the NHS’s increasingly precarious and politicised new norm. Paul Briddock, director of policy at the Healthcare Financial Management Association, which represents healthcare FDs, says: “Quite frankly, why would anybody want to be a director of finance in one of these organisations at this moment in time - the job is nigh-on impossible.”

Willetts: White collar jobs could disappear
David Willetts, executive chairman of the Resolution Foundation, has warned middle class white collar jobs in the financial services and law industries are at risk of disappearing because of rising wages. The former Conservative minister suggested certain jobs could be eventually “routinized” by computers because of the new basic hourly pay rate, which comes in next April.

IMF cuts growth forecast
The IMF has downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year and warned that “a return to robust and synchronized global expansion remains elusive." The IMF reduced its figure to 3.1% from the 3.3% it predicted in July. The 2016 forecast is down to 3.6% from 3.8%." The report also warns that the risks of an outcome worse than its forecasts are more pronounced than they were just a few months ago. The sharpest downgrades are for emerging economies, especially Brazil, Nigeria, South Africa and Russia. But the IMF believes Britain's economy is still solid. Having grown at a rate equivalent to 2.25% a year in the first half of 2015, the IMF forecasts an improvement to 2.5% growth, settling down to 2.2% next year.

House prices fall
Figures from Halifax show house prices fell by nearly 1% in September from a month earlier, the biggest drop in more than a year. Its latest house price index showed that the average cost of a home in the UK fell by 0.9% to £202,859, down from the 2.7% rise reported in August. From a year earlier, house prices increased by 8.6% in three months to September, easing from August’s 9% growth. On a quarterly basis, house prices fell from 3% to 2%.

SFO and Tesco in talks to settle probe
Tesco has held talks with the Serious Fraud Office about a deal to settle a criminal probe into last year’s accounting scandal. Both parties are said to have been in discussions about the possibility of signing a deferred prosecution agreement, which would involve a court-approved deal under which the company would admit wrongdoing but avoid any immediate criminal sanctions. Corporate lawyers have also suggested that any agreement between Tesco and the SFO could also entail the installation of an independent monitor who would supervise the preparation of the company's accounts for a specific period.
