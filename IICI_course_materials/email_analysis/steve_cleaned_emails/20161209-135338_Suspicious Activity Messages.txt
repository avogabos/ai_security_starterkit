Hi all,

In the event that we receive communication about potential fraud/other crime from Companies House, the police or any other official bodies it is imperative that we do not contact the customer. This could potentially result in someone who has committed fraud then being alerted to investigations into their crime, which could result in liability for the company. Please forward all communication to us in London and we will investigate.

Thanks for your cooperation,

Elliot
