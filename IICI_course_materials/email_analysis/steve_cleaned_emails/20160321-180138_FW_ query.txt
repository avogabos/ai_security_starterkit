Thank you for that. one more question on the foundation is: what accounts
(if any) are required to be filed? You will be required to submit
abbreviated accounts annually, these are not publicaly accessible

 

We currently have two new clients moving "through" the system and who will
require their foundations soon (both are currently waiting on year

ends) with a further two due to follow. anticipated foundations by end of
April are therefore 4, with 3-4 offshore companies in addition to this. do
you have any flexibility on prices? Not on the inciropraton costs as these
are the register fees, for ancilliary services we may offer 10% at this
time,

 

I will be completely honest, this is not a problem for occasional
formations, but interest in our service has increased with the new UK
dividend tax, so we are looking for a price competitive, efficient, fast and
reliable "partner" that we can pass the bulk of new formations through

foundation formation - Gambia

 

Is the foundation allowed to do limited trading (buy/sell shares, loan to
beneficiaries, buy/leaseback business assets etc)? yes

 

Is the Founder allowed to be the sole council member, or the
controller/overseer? (if not, how many council members should there be e.g
Panama requires 3 & Nevis 1. 1 is fine, cant directly be founder but may be
company owned by founder

 

Does there have to be defined beneficiaries? no

 

What information is reported to the local authorities? Only the charter and
the founder

 

What information is publicly available? Nothing, only via document
authentication an access codes

 

I help clients set up tax efficient business structures involving a
Foundation + 2 or more offshore companies and I am looking to "outsource"
(so to speak) the formations part to free up more of my time which means I
need to know full information on any jurisdictions we use to ensure their
suitability for each client (we act for businesses from SME size up to and
including listed PLC's. 

We can take over the outsourced section
