Dear Martin

 

If there are any transactions before or on 31 January 2017, even if there is
a single transaction before or on 31 January 2017, then you need us the

accounts. To file trading company accounts you need to purchase our Value
Accounting service. The cost will be:

 

-         Value Accounting : GBP 300/-

-         VAT (20%) : GBP 60/-

 

Total : GBP 360/-

 

Please arrange payment and relevant documents before 20-October-2017. If
payment or documents are delayed then service charges will be GBP 500/- plus
VAT.

 

Since our system for time being is not charging VAT, therefore we request
you to send the payment by bank transfer to following bank and emails us the
bank transfer receipt with transaction dewtails before 20-Oct-2017.
