Hi Steve


Is there any news on the VAT Registration no.


We have a client to bill this month that was delayed from last month, so this is getting urgent.


Many thanks

Chris

Hi

No the Vat number is not issued yet, it will take couple weeks before HMRC will contact you directly with VAT certificate and registration number.


Regards

Steve

Hi Steve

Yes, I understand this, but as they sent this to us this morning I was thinking you should login for some reason.

Has our vat number been issued?
Thanks

This is the reference number which you can use when you contact HMRC regarding update on your VAT application.


The login part is for us, because application was submitted through our account.
