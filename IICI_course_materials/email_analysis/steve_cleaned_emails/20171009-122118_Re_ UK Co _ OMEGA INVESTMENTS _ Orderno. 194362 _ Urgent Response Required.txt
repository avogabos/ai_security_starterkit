Attached You will find a copy of my ID (both pages) and last bank statement. I think they are self-explanatory and don’t need translation and notarization.

Information about company activity:
The main scope will be consultancy services it IT and TELCO. I will provide project management, business analysis and feasibility studies regarding inventing and introducing new services and products to the market. The plan is also to look for and organize investment for start-ups, which are working on new services.

Planned annual turnover - ca. 50.000 GBP

Payment
I am very surprised, that you introduce any additional payments outside your price list from your website and order corfirmation received by me... But I agree to pay it, as long as you declare, that the info I sens you above will be sufficient and there will be no further obstacles to incorporate my company. As the payment will be made from my GB account in Revolut, you will receive it as soon as possible.
