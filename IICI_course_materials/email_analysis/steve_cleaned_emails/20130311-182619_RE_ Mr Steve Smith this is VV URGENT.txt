Dear Bruno,

Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta

The urgency is due to the Event in Dubai on 14th March 2013 , where we are
the Title Sponsor.
I do not want to miss this opportunity of presenting our US & HongKong
Office address and contact details.

I am sure Mr. Steve is on this and do  expect to get it by tomorrow as after
getting it I need to complete the Power Point presentation for the event.

Thanks
