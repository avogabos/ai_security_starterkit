Re: FW: (Sovereign International Group Ltd), renewal of

Hi Steve.
Well, this is a strange customer who always
wishes to pay till August but then just keeps using our services further
without any extension and / or payment... So the amount to pay (since last
August and till August 2015 - which in total is one year) is 400 Euro (the
special price for your customers, if you remember).
You can send the payment to
paypal@swissmaildrop.ch
or
by wire - whichever option you prefer.

Hi
Steve.
Sorry
for the delay with the reply - was out of office, family reasons.
The
amount for
Sovereign
International Group Ltd will be 240 Euro (48 Euro x 5 months).
Regarding the other customer:
unfortunately, we cannot help them - we do not deal with large and heavy
parcels on regular basis, we forward only letters + occasional (!) small (!)
packages.

Dear
Steve,
I
am fine, thank you. Hope you, too.
However,
I am getting slightly irritated by this customer of yours...
We
cannot check if any post has been returned to the sender because we have no
contact with the senders and the postmen do not report anybody about the
returned mail.
This
month we forwarded mail to South Africa on 05.11.13 and 20.11.13. Earlier dates
in your can find in my previous emails.
The
courier shipment was posted on 20.11.13, together with other mail. I cannot
tell you if it had the tracking number you mentioned because we do not record
that. By the way, the number you gave produces no search results.
In
my personal opinion, the only problem with this customer not receiving his mail
is that he cannot provide a reliable forwarding address. If he fixes that, he
should have all his mail delivered to him.
Anyway,
I have serious suspicions about them and we might resume providing our service
to them (will discuss this with my boss and will tell you tomorrow) - read
this:
http://www.scam.com/showthread.php?p=1323645
and
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21989.htm
We
have had enough problems with the Swiss police because of fraud-and-scam customers
and need no more headaches.

Dear

which
bank account do you prefer: Swiss Euro, German or British (because of the
banking fees)?
By
the way, one regular letter was sent on 22.10.13 from Germany to South Africa
by normal priority mail.
Please
let the customer know and kindly ask him to tell you (and us) if it arrived
fine (when he gets it).

Re: Postal Address Change (Sovereign International Group Ltd)
Hi
Steve,
Courier
shipments are paid for separately and prior to forwarding.
The
cheapest but still reliable option would be TNT (it is part of the Swiss Post).
The shipment cost will be 90 CHF (ca. 73 Euros as of today).
Other
couriers like DHL, UPS or FedEx will be much more expensive.
