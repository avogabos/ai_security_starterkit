Dear Sirs,

please note that we have made the payment by bank transfer last friday but unfortunately there was a mistake because the payment was made of 700 Euro instead of 700 GBP.
Today we are making the payment of the balance due.
Please confirm receipt. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Best regards
