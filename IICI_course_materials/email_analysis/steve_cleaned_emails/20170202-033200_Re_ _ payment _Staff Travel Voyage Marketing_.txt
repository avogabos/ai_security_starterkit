Dear Phil and Paul
Staff Travel Voyage Marketing is in registration process with
Seychelles registry, to complete the registration registry has came up with one
more requirement, they need company director/s to put following information on
the paper and sign it.
Business activity of the Company is Investment in Tourism
Business, the source of funds is from personal savings and income and the
geography of business is Global (please do mention few major country names)
It would be better if you put it on Staff Travel Voyage Limited letterhead.
Please arrange the above document as soon as possible.

very much appreciate if you can do again, especially as we are known to you for
