Hi Steve.

You are really early - we have got it already (in the morning) ;-)
Should be send it to South Africa just by regular mail (priority)?

Hi Elena
A DHL shipment going direct to the agent in Switzerland
[i.e Sovereign International, BCB Bachstrasse
1,Butschwil, Switzerland, CH-9606] and not to the Zurich
Aargauerstrasse address as per your advice previously.  The DHL tracking
number is 5984527743 and this correspondance is important and I need this
forwarding via post to the new address I gave you in South Africa please.
  Just wanted to confirm this.
Thanks and regards
Steve
