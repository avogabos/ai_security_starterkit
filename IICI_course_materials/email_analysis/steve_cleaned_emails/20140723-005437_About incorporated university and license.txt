Subject: About incorporated university and license

Dear Steve,

Greeting from Josh Tth is nice to speak to you.

About license in Gambia not a bad place serious no matter how in the
history is under UK in the past if I am correct.

We mainly doing education no other sort of business!

Don't need to concern bank account as I think of solution myself.

Most important is the authority can issues a education license to operate
virtually or later physically in Gambia offering postsecondary course like
Degree, Master and Doctorate.

Please advise me the licences and incorporated fee? And the processing time?

Thank you,
Josh Tth
