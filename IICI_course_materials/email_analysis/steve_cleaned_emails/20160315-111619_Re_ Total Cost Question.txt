Hello Steve,

Thanks for the reply.

I have really idea to go forward with the Belize offshore company + Cyprus
bank account.

I have a few questions:

1. What I need to send specifically to formations house every year to renew
the company licence? Every year I need to show the total invoiced of the
business to renew? I receive from Belize authority the certificate of the
total of the year for individual tax's reasons in my country? I know I
don't pay tax's in Belize but in my country Portugal, I need to pay tax's
of the individual profit's from for example this company of Belize. How can
I receive an official Belize paper with what I total invoiced to show the
Portuguese authorities to pay my individual taxes? Because in my country I
need to pay about 28% to 35% of tax of the total I win of every activity.
And I need papers to show the authorities the money comes from that company
and that bank account and it's legal company and legal money. You get I try
to explain to you?

2. What is the cost of renew to pay to you for renew my licence company
Belize?

3. I have year renew costs to pay to you because the Cyprus bank account?

4. My company will have a address in Belize for invoice proposes?

5. The Delaware Offshore Company with a Cyprus Bank Account is really a
problem? Because in first I prefer the Delaware, only if is a problem I
choose Belize. Because I think for personal tax reasons in Portugal, maybe
I don't have problem with USA Company and maybe I will have problems with
Belize Company. You have experienced with Portuguese costumers with Belize
Companies?

Waiting your feedback.

Thanks.

Best regards
