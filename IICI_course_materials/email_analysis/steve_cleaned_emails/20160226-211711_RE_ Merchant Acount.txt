OK.
I will have 3 different prices for products. Is each product supported by its own checkout button?

2. I have clicked on the 30 day free trial button will your technical team integrate it onto my website?

3. Regarding withdrawals of monies that customers pay is this available daily to put into my PayPal account or is it weekly?

Cheers
Craig
