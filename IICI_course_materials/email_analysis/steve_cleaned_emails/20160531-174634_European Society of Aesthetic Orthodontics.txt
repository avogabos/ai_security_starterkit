Hi Steve,

I hope you are well.

We are expecting a really important letter from HMRC (Inland Revenue) and
are surprised that it has not yet arrived.

We would be extremely grateful if you could check with the London mail
forwarding service (Harley Street) and let us know if any mail is currently
waiting to be forwarded to us.

Many thanks and best regards
