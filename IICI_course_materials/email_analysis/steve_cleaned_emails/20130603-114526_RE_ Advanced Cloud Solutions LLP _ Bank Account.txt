Hi Charlotte

 

Hope you had a good weekend.

 

Can you let me know ASAP about the bank appointment, Aleks does not live in
London so I have to give him notice if he needs to be at the bank this
afternoon.

 

We really need to get this account set up by the end of the month.

 

Thanks

Chris

Hi Chris.

 

Can you give me time on Tuesday that you can go to the bank. I can arrange
everything before then that is needed. RBS have also asked for a letter of
Good Standing from our agent in Seychelles. I have ordered it and it will
take a few days  this is a new requirement that both RBS and Barclays ask
for and so we did not previously request this.

 

If I can arrange the appointment for Tuesday I will have the required
documents ready.

 

Thanks

 

Charlotte
