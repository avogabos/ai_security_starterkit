Dear Steve

When you offered to arrange Apostille for us, do you mean that you need 
us to provide this set of documents that you listed which you will then 
certify for us for a fee of £150 (for 15 working days), right? In other 
words, do you provide these documents and certify them or do you only 
certify what we provide for a fee of £150? Please clarify. Thanks.

Regards
David
