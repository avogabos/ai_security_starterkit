Dear Charlotte,

Please accept my sincere apologies.

I have found another person to deal with my entity formation needs.

I have located the existing Valecha Capital Ltd. registration. I have not
been able to locate details of the sole proprietorship under the name AJAY
GOPAL VALECHA. 

Can you please provide the registration details of the sole proprietorship
registration I am referring to, and its related documentation?

Thanking You.

Regards,

Ajay
