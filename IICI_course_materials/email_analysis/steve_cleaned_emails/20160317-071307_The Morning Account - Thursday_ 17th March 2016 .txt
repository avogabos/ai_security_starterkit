BUDGET

 

Income tax boost for lower and middle earners

The Chancellor has confirmed the threshold at which people pay 40% income tax will rise from its current level of £42,385 to £45,000 in April 2017. Mr Osborne claimed the increase to the higher rate threshold was “the biggest above-inflation cash increase since Nigel Lawson introduced the 40p rate almost 30 years ago”. However, middle-class Scots are set to pay more income tax than their peers anywhere else in the UK after the SNP signalled it will not introduce the same policy. The Scottish Government said SNP ministers “do not consider this to be the right time for high earners to pay less tax.” Mr Osborne also announced that the tax-free personal allowance will rise from £11,000 in April 2016 to £11,500 in April 2017.

Stamp duty overhaul announced

Commercial stamp duty will be overhauled with the introduction of a 0% rate on purchases up to £150,000, a 2% rate on the next £100,000 and a 5% top rate above £250,000. A new 2% rate for high-value leases with net present value above £5m will also take effect from today. The overhaul introduces a “slice” system, in which stamp duty is payable on the portion of each transaction that falls within the relevant price band. Large-scale professional landlords will also face a three percentage point stamp duty surcharge when buying rental properties, after George Osborne rejected proposals for an exemption for bigger investors.

CGT rates cut

The higher rate of CGT will be cut from 28% to 20% this April. In addition, the basic rate of CGT will be cut from the current 18% rate to 10% at the start of the new tax year on 6 April. Budget documents show that the government estimates the changes to CGT will cost it more than £600m a year from 2017-18 onwards. However, the old higher rates will still apply to gains on the sale of a residential property that is not a main home (such as a second home or a buy-to-let property), and also to "carried interest".

Multinationals miss out

Banks and multinationals are set to lose out after being hit by new restrictions on how they can deal with historic losses and interest on their debts. The Chancellor has brought in restrictions barring all such carried forward losses to 50% of profits. The changes will only apply to companies making profits over £5m, and is set to raise around £400m a year. A slightly larger amount will be raised by tightening existing rules restricting losses that can be used by the banking sector, which will be reduced to 25% of current profits. Mr Osborne will also cap relief on interest payments used to reduce tax paid on UK profits at 30% of UK earnings, with exceptions for groups with legitimately high interest payments. Overall, cuts to corporate tax relief are expected to raise £9bn over the next five years for the government.

Financial Times, Page: 3   Daily Mail, Page: 8, 9   The Daily Telegraph, Budget 2016, Page: 1, 4   The Times, Budget 2016, Page: 12

 

Corporation tax shakeup

Despite the new measures targeting multinationals, the headline rate of corporation tax, currently 20%, will fall to 17% by 2020, George Osborne has confirmed. The reduction will leave Britain with one of the most competitive rates of profits tax among large nations - America's rate is 40%, while Germany and France are on 29% and 32% respectively. The announcement goes further than an earlier target of an 18% corporation tax rate by the end of the decade and would cost £945m in its first year, the Treasury said.

Financial Times, Page: 3   The Independent, Budget 2016, Page: 10   Daily Mail, Page: 8, 9   The Sun, Page: 8   The Daily Telegraph, Budget 2016, Page: 1, 4

 

Business rates reform

Annual increases to business rates will rise in line with the Retail Price Index, instead of the higher Consumer Price Index, while around 600,000 commercial properties will be removed from the rates tax permanently, the Chancellor announced. George Osborne said he would end temporary rates relief for businesses on an ad hoc basis, and replace it with a permanent cut for any business with a rateable value of less than £15,000, up from £6000 last year. Greater London will get powers to collect business rates, rather than getting a proportion from central government, from next year, instead of 2020 as first planned.

Sharing-economy generation handed break

People who boost their income with occasional odd jobs will be allowed to keep up to £2,000 in extra earnings without paying tax. And short-term landlords, such as those using the Airbnb platform, have been handed a new £1,000 tax-free allowance offered on income from such rentals. The Treasury said growth in the “sharing economy” drove the decision, with more people given the opportunity to become “micro-entrepreneurs”.

Financial Times, Page: 10   The Guardian   Daily Mail, Page: 8    The Times, Budget 2016, Page; 4, 5    Independent i, Page: 10

 

Offshore property tycoons targeted

The Chancellor has set out plans to target tycoons behind a wave of £1m central London flats whose profits are shifted to tax shelters such as Guernsey and Jersey to avoid full UK tax, with HMRC launching a task force to crack down on offshore property developers. It will target anyone based outside the UK trading in and developing property, rather than those who buy houses for a long-term investment.

Evening Standard, Page; 1, 4, 5   The Daily Telegraph, Budget 2016, Page: 4

 

Online retailers face responsibility for VAT evaders

A crackdown has been announced on foreign firms selling products online in the UK without paying VAT. Online platforms such as Amazon and eBay would be held liable for missing VAT if they fail to act against traders using their sites.

Financial Times, Page: 11   The Sun, Page: 8   The Guardian, Budget, Page: 9   The Daily Telegraph, Page: 9

 

Budget reaction

In the FT, Chris Giles predicts that the various Budget giveaways mean the Chancellor will now have to unveil a “huge tax bombshell” in 2019-20. Elsewhere in the paper, Martin Wolf concludes that George Osborne has focussed on “gimmicks” and “catchy announcements” rather than fundamental reforms. The Telegraph’s Allister Heath is also unimpressed, describing yesterday’s announcement as a “cynical attempt to embrace populism.” Meanwhile, Janet Daley says the Chancellor appears more focussed on plotting his route to number 10 rather than delivering meaningful reform, a view echoed by Max Hastings in the Mail. Elsewhere, the Times’ Philip Aldrick says weaker growth left Mr Osborne struggling to deliver much good news. Regarding corporate tax reform, Nils Pratley in the Guardian questions whether the latest measures really will bring in the £9bn the Chancellor expects. “Never underestimate multinationals’ ability to find new loopholes,” he states.

Budget boosts small businesses

Small business has praised George Osborne’s Budget, with Enterprise Nation and the FSB welcoming changes to corporation tax, business rates and tax relief for the sharing economy. Small business owners also welcomed changes to commercial stamp duty, CGT and a new £1,000 tax-free allowance for people with part-time, home-based ventures. Mike Cherry, policy director at the FSB, said the Chancellor had listened to “calls for the tax system to be made simpler for small businesses and the self-employed and taken important action on business rates”.

Financial Times, Page: 8    The Times, Budget 2016,  Page: 16

 

Lifetime Isa announced

Under a new Lifetime Isa announced in the Budget millions of adults under 40 will receive a 25% bonus from the government. From April 2017 they will be able to put in up to £4,000 a year, with the annual bonus of up to £1,000 paid until the age of 50. The Chancellor said that savers would be able to withdraw money from a Lifetime Isa at any time, and would not pay any tax on it. He also revealed that from April 2017 all savers will be able to put up to £20,000 a year into Isas, up from £15,240 at the moment.

Class 2 NICs scrapped

Class 2 NICs are to be abolished from 2018, in a move calculated to give a tax cut of more than £130 for 3m self-employed workers. Currently about 3.4m people pay Class 2 NICs at a rate of £2.80 a week, which contributes to their state pension entitlement and other benefits.

Financial Times, Page: 14   Daily Mail, Page: 11   The Sun, Page: 9   The Times, Budget 2016, Page: 3

 

Museums and galleries to get tax relief

Museums and galleries are to get tax relief to help cover the costs of developing temporary or touring exhibitions, the Chancellor has said. George Osborne also said the museum VAT refund eligibility would be extended to any museum or gallery that offers free entry.

The Daily Telegraph, Page: 6, 7

 

Osborne shuts personal service loophole

A tax loophole used by public sector employees including BBC presenters and civil servants has been closed. George Osborne said public sector employees will no longer be able to use personal service companies to lower their bill.

Tax office to open 7 days a week

HMRC is to offer support seven days a week in a bid to improve customer service. The tax office will extend its telephone opening hours and recruit 800 new call centre staff by 2017 in a bid to reduce call waiting times.

Daily Mail, Page: 9   The Sun, Page: 8

 

Sugar tax grabs headlines

A new sugar tax on the soft drinks industry is to be introduced in two years' time, raising £520m a year to be spent on doubling funding for primary school sport in England.

Osborne must do more to crack down on tax havens

Developing countries are hit considerably harder than rich nations by tax avoidance, losing up to 26 times more revenue, writes Diane Abbott MP. She says the Chancellor must honour his original pledge for country by country reporting, and therefore base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), to be made public.

ECONOMY

 

Growth forecasts cut for next five years

The UK economy will grow more slowly in the next five years than had been expected in November, the Office for Budget Responsibility has said. The OBR had previously forecast that the economy would grow 2.4% this year, but is now predicting a rate of 2.0%. George Osborne said the cuts had been due to a reduction in the OBR's forecasts of productivity. However, the Chancellor confirmed that he was still on-track to meet his target of having a budget surplus by 2019-20.

Unemployment at lowest since 2005 but wage growth steady

The UK jobless total fell by 28,000 to 1.68m in the three months to January, the sixth consecutive monthly fall. The national unemployment rate of 5.1% is the lowest since Autumn 2005, according to the ONS. The number of people in work rose to reach a new record high of 31.42m, up nearly half a million in a year. Average earnings increased by 2.1% including bonuses and by 2.2% excluding bonuses compared with a year earlier.

The OBR had previously forecast that the economy would grow 2.4% this year, but is now predicting a rate of 2.0%. George Osborne said the cuts had been due to a reduction in the OBR's forecasts of productivity.
However, the Chancellor confirmed that he was still on-track to meet his target of having a budget surplus by 2019-20.

Unemployment at lowest since 2005 but wage growth steady
The UK jobless total fell by 28,000 to 1.68m in the three months to January, the sixth consecutive monthly fall. The national unemployment rate of 5.1% is the lowest since Autumn 2005, according to the ONS. The number of people in work rose to reach a new record high of 31.42m, up nearly half a million in a year. Average earnings increased by 2.1% including bonuses and by 2.2% excluding bonuses compared with a year earlier.
