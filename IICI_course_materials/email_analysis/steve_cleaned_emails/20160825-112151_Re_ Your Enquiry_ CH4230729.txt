Dear Sir

Thank you for your e mail, if the company is being restored to remain on the register,
you may apply for administrative restoration, we would require the following documents and fees:

RT01 form and application fee of £100

The Bona Vacantia waiver letter, details can be found on the website gov.uk
please enter waiver letter in the search box for further information.

Annual Accounts for period end 30/11/15, there are no outstanding penalties.

Annual Returns (Form AR01) for period end 27/01/13 and filing fee of £40.
Annual Returns (Form AR01) for period end 24/02/16 and filing fee of £40.
Please download and complete the new version AR01 (Version 9.0) which is available from our website www.gov.uk/companieshouse

The company was dissolved as the Annual Return for 24/02/16 was not filed.


We cannot accept a cheque drawn on the company account, as when a company
is dissolved, the company bank account is frozen.

Please allow ten working days from the day of receipt for us to process the documents.

Please mark all correspondence for the attention of the Restoration Section (RT01).

Yours faithfully

Mr D Slee
