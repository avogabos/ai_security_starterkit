For Staff Travel Voyage
Limiuted I effected a transfer fo shares from Alexandria to Andrew, but
Alexandria's shares remain and the 4000 transferred do not leave her
allocation?
Also when and how does this get
effected, once I have made changes on the system does it then get submitted
your end to be registered with Seychelles company House?
Don't do anything your end if
it does as need to make some amends
Trying to get it to 6000
Alexandria's and 4000 Andrew, but we seem to have too many and the extra 1 I tested
the transfer system with in Sep and that I transferred back to her is still
showing as an extra one
Appreciate clarification so I know the proceedure.
Twenty four limited is also to
have some of these sahres so not finished yet
