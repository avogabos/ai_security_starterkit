Hi Steve,
 
I have been dealing with Delphine with respect to setting up a premade company. There are a couple of points that I would like to confirm with respect to the company please, as follows:
 
- The registered address has been updated but not the change of company name, we requested this to be changed to ATS Worldwide. Can you please advise if there is anything further I need to do for this to be actioned?
 
- The SIC code also hasn't been updated, can you please update this to 62012?
 
- Finally she has provided us with the amended accounts for the company, these are all correct except for the registered address for the company is showing as my personal address, not the actual address which is:
 
2 PUDDLE DOCK 
BLACKFRIARS                         
LONDON                         
ENGLAND             
EC4V 3BB
 
Also with the accounts, can you please confirm what the cost is for these? I had been quoted £500 for this when I was referred to Formations House for the company set up.
 
Many thanks for your help.
