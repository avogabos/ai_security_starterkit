Dear Steve,

Thank you for the update!

Can you pls send me the instructions for the e-mail set up since I am doing it directly via the internal server via my account with you son your site and it still is not working. I am not using any funny characters or anything just simple names and letters. i don’t understand why the problem persists.

As far as the dates for the rest of the filling ok noted in my calendar and will act accordingly.

Do you think I should submit a request for the CT41G as well? Would that not confuse the authorities? Will it make any difference? Pls confirm that I should if it does…

I shall await your feedback while always thanking you for your promptness and assistance.

Best regards,

Maria

I wanted to ask you about adding two people that work for me and setting up their e-mail via the server. Is there any problem with it? I try to add the e-mail address and it keeps shutting me out and the message reads âinvalid passwordâ even tough I am setting up an new account. Can you please help me out with this? I did set up last year 2 e-mails for colleagues which later on I deleted and they were set up ok with no problems. Has something changed since then? Pls help.. Thanks a lot in advance. Maria
