Hi Steve

I think I misunderstood about the DPS - I think our details on our other
companies (we are directors and shareholders of ABD and Elf)  is all
visible so don't worry about that for now

Hi Phil,
Thank you for completing due diligence.
One last point, since you have ordered DPS (Director Protection
Service) which hides director/s address in public records you might want to use
SPS (shareholder privacy service) GBP 150 (per annum) as well.
In your company, directors are also shareholders which can be
seen as a single entity but Company Registrar consider director and shareholder
as 2 separate entities, therefore DPS will have an effect on directors address
but will not effect on shareholders address and shareholders address will be
visible in public records. In order to hide shareholders address you will need
SPS.
Please confirm if you wish to add SPS with your company and
arrange payment of GBP 150/- or you wish to go ahead with registration using only
DPS and do not want to use SPS.
Waiting for your reply.
Regards
Steve…
