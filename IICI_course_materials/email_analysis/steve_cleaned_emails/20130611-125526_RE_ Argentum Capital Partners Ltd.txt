Dear Tim

 

 

Please advice the bank that Victoria William is no more the
director for the companies. They can verify this information by contacting
company registrar.

 

 

You can also see that Victoria William not mentioned anywhere in
the Apostiile set of documents.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve

Dear Steve



I have now received the papers for the above. I have tried to open an account
with Barclays but the Bank advises that Victoria William one of the Directors
needs to be present at the meeting. Please advise as a matter of urgency

Thank you 

Tim
