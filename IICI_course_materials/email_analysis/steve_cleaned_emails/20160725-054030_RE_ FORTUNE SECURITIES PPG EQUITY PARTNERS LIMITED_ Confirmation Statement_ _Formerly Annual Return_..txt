Dear Customer,
We would like to inform you that your company Confirmation Statement (Formerly Annual Return) has not been processed as you have selected Nominee Secretary Ltd as PSC (Person with Significant Control).
As per Companies House rules corporate body cannot be appointed as PSC.
Therefore we shall now re-submit your company Confirmation Statement with MASSIMILIANO TURI as PSC and remove Nominee Secretary Ltd.
We now await your response.
Kind Regards,
Customer Support
Formations House
