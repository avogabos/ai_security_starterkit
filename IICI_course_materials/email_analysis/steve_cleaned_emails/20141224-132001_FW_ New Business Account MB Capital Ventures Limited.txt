Felix,
In your email of the 19th December you stated that the company will be shareholder of a Forex Company, Provide advice to a Money Manager Company and also involved in international commerce mainly in the field of olive oil re-selling and agricultural products originating from Greece.
The nature of business is not one particular industry. 
I have spoken to Compliance and they have advised we are unable to open the account.
I have attached a family tree structure template.
Please complete and return to me and I can revert back to the compliance and see if there is any way we can assist you.
Many thanks

Hi Felix,
Thank you for your email and the information although there was no attached business plan.
Unfortunately we will not be able to look at opening this account as we are not opening any accounts that are related to Money Services or anyway connected to money services.
Therefore, I have cancelled the appointment for next week.
Apologies for the inconvenience.
