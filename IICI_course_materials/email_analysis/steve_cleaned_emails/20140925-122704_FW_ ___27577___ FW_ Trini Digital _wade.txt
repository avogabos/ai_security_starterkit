Sorry Nadya, I didn't realize this client is a Belarus national until this
moment. Unfortunately we can't accept clients from OFAC sanctioned
countries.

 

We are following this list:

Looking forward to our next case together.

Hi Nadya, 

 

Based on what I read in the pre-approval form, I'm happy to move forward
with this application.

 

Wade Lambert, one of my private bankers, will be working with you on this
application and client.

 

I am also forwarding this e-mail, as you see, into accounts@europacbank.com
because that is the best place to send this proposal e-mail to. If you can
remember to send these cases into accounts@europacbank.com in the future and
address me, I would really appreciate it because it's a ticket-based inbox
that helps us manage our application conversations efficiently, which in
turn helps us activate accounts for you faster.

 

 

Regards,
