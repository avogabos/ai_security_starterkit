Hello

I am the Strategy Director of a new start up
We decided a Harley St address might be useful. Having a meeting room as a back up to the meeting rooms at my club (RSM) would be advantageous
My issue is the 50p region page for scanning in post.
In years gone by when scanners cost £000's, yes a very high premium was understandable.
I would be willing to pay on a time basis, from opening the letters, to the end of the scan job, but if I get a 30 page sales brochure dressed up as medical research ( very common) I would be furious to pay anything.
So, we would buy Infinioffice today for a year if you are able to accept that the pricing model needs adjustment. I do not want to waste your time by you suggesting, say, 40p per page, but all the other ( except for the few streets around Harley St) charge on a time and per penny basis.
If you are unable to accept that paying maybe £600 pm for scanning 60 pages a day, ( that in my £80 scanner takes under 3 minutes)  is excessive, I respect your decision.
I am sure you also appreciate we are unable to recover the VAT, so 50p is 60p
Regards
Mr David A Steene
