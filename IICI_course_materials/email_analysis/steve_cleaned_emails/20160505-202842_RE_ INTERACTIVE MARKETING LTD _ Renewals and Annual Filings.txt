Hi Steve

 

I think we want to cancel the Company Protection Service fee, as we are
required to publish our address on our website anyway. I believe that this
service is purely providing us with anonymity in this area?

 

Registered Address Renewal from June 2015 to June 2016 : GBP 100 (per annum)
Company Protection Service from June 2015 to June 2016 : GBP 275 (per annum)
- REMOVE
Express Dormant Company Accounts Filing : GBP 150
This should leave the total at : GBP 250?

 

Can you please remind me of our customer ID and password please? Companies
House told me that the annual filings need to be completed immediately as
our penalty is already 375 pounds. Can you confirm how quickly this will be
done from your side please, as we do not want to incur further costs?

 

Also, can you please ensure that all correspondence comes to this email
address from now on please admin@theadvantage.club
<mailto:admin@theadvantage.club>  as it is our new URL and the old
address/URL at Voucherclubs.com isn't checked as regularly?

 

Many thanks for your help and look forward to hearing back from you ASAP.

 

Amanda
