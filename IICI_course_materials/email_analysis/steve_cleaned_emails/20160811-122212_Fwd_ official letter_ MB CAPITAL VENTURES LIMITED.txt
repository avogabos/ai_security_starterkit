Dear Steve,

Kindly send me the corresponding link so that I can pay for the preparation and filing of the company accounts which are due soon.

Kindly check what else is due for preparation and payment in the next month or two and send it to me so that we may not miss any deadlines.


Thank you very much in advance for everything.

Best regards,

Maria
