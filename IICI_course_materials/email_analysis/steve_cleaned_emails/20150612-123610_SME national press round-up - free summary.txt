SMEs believe apprentices improve productivity
According to new research, nearly 40% of SMEs in the West Midlands are currently offering apprenticeships. The Close Brothers Business Barometer reveals that 43% of the firms which have taken on apprentices say it allows them to develop skill sets the business may be lacking. Just over a third of respondents stated it gave them access to the best young talent. Over one in 10 SMEs said that apprentices improved their business productivity. Meanwhile, the company’s parent, Close Brothers Group, has launched a new apprentice programme where it has pledged to contribute to the cost of apprentices for 60 SMEs in the engineering and manufacturing sector over a three-year period. The University of Sheffield AMRC Training Centre and the Manufacturing Technologies Association (MTA) will help SMEs recruit and train the new generation of skilled engineering workers.

Interns can help ease pressure
Helen Brand OBE, chief executive of ACCA, explains why she believes it is important for SMEs to use interns. Ms Brand says interns can provide a valuable resource to smaller businesses where existing staff are busy working hard on maintaining “business-as-usual”. She adds that interns can look at issues such as competitor analysis or audits; carry out marketing tasks or undertake time consuming tasks like market research. Ms Brand notes that ACCA is calling for at least 60% of all businesses across the UK to have employed a paid intern by 2017.

MANUFACTURING

Domestic orders increase for manufacturers
The latest CBI SME trends survey for the manufacturing sector shows domestic orders increased for the seventh quarter running while export orders remained constant. The report also predicts that the export numbers will continue to remain flat for the next quarter with manufacturers being less optimistic as a result of pricing concerns. Manufacturers continued to create more jobs in the three months to April, with the rate of growth remaining above average. Employment in the sector is expected to grow strongly once again over the next quarter. Katja Hall, CBI Deputy Director-General, said: “Smaller manufacturers are reporting solid increases in output, orders and jobs. While growth was a little slower this quarter, they expect a pick-up in activity in the next three months.”

Nissan creates 300 jobs
Three hundred staff are being recruited at Sunderland’s Nissan factory as it prepares to begin producing its upmarket sport utility vehicle, the Infiniti Q30. The move is part of a £250m investment in the UK and the first premium-brand Infiniti vehicle to be built in Europe.

OUTLOOK

Aerospace suppliers falling to foreign owners
A report from Civitas has found that Britain’s lax controls on company ownership have led to a rise in businesses that supply the aerospace industry being taken over by foreign owners. The number of foreign-owned companies which feed the aircraft industry has jumped from 14% to 41% since 1990. Civitas said foreign interests were “cherry-picking” the most promising companies, making it harder for Britain to cut its trade deficit.

LENDING

Micro-lending initiative beats target
Grameen in the UK, a scheme which lends small amounts of money to small businesses and new start-ups, has beaten its own target in its first year. The micro-lending initiative facilitated by Glasgow Caledonian University has issued more than 100 loans. It is the first such Grameen-style scheme in Western Europe. Grameen in the UK offers small loans, initially of £1,000, for up to 52 weeks to new start-ups and existing small businesses currently not served by any financial services. The model has been used in developing countries to support entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty, and in many cases to empower women. However in the UK, currently 60% of Grameen's borrowers are men. The venture is backed by a number of funders including Tesco Bank.

PENSIONS

NEST aims to simplify AE for SMEs
Auto-enrolment (AE) pension provider NEST is set to launch an online payroll tool that aims to simplify AE for SMEs. Due to go live in winter 2015, ahead of over half a million SMEs staging in 2016, NEST Web Services enables payroll software to interrogate NEST and update information in real time. The new tool means that any payroll software user can exchange information using a common interface, if it has compatible software. Helen Dean, executive director of product and marketing at NEST, says: “NEST Web Services revolutionises auto enrolment for employers by automating their administration and integrating it with payroll systems.”

FINANCE

CBI calls for business rate changes
The CBI has said the business rates system is a major barrier to investment and needs urgent reform. The industry body has recommended that smaller properties should be exempt from business rates, revaluations should be more frequent, and future increases should be limited as a result of a switch of the inflation benchmark which they track. Katja Hall, the CBI’s deputy director general, commented: “We want a simpler, fairer and more competitive system by having more frequent valuations, removing the smallest properties from paying rates, and using the Consumer Price Index so rates don't outpace inflation.”

EMPLOYMENT

Visa cap breach leaves City jobs vacant
City graduate schemes and management positions are to be left vacant after the government’s cap on skilled workers from outside Europe was breached. Hundreds of employers have received letters informing them that their visa applications have been rejected because of high demand. Priority has been given to higher-salaried roles and applications from science and academia, meaning graduate positions and middle-management jobs in the private sector have taken a hit. It is the first time the 20,700-a-year cap on skilled workers from outside the EU has been breached since its introduction in 2011.

ECONOMY

OBR says ageing population threatens surplus plan
The Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that George Osborne would probably have to break his new rule to run a budget surplus in “normal times” as soon as 2023, because of the spending pressures of an ageing population. In its annual Fiscal Sustainability Report, the OBR said it is likely taxes will rise sharply or public spending be cut further in order to deal with demographic pressures. It calculated that by 2065, 26% of the population of England and Wales would be more than 65 years old, up from 18% today, increasing the cost of pensions and health and social care.
