Cameron warns of Labour tax bombshell
David Cameron will today claim that a Labour government would impose tax rises worth £15bn over the next two years, costing the average family a total of £3,028 extra between next year and 2020. The figure is based on a £30bn costing of Labour's promise to clear the deficit, as well as a claim that Ed Miliband wants to raise half the total by putting up taxes. It comes as one of Labour's biggest private donors has warned that Ed Miliband's plans to re-introduce the 50p tax rate and bring in a mansion tax risk "alienating" middle-class voters. Dr Assem Allam told the Telegraph that the Labour leader needed to stop targeting the wealthy and entrepreneurial.

SNP backs 50p rate of tax across UK
The SNP says it will support the introduction of a 50p top rate of income tax across the UK after the general election. The promise was made at the party's conference in Glasgow by Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney and the SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie. The rate would apply to those earning more than £150,000, matching the Labour party policy. "We still think that those with the very broadest shoulders should bear a slightly larger share of the burden" said Mr Hosie.

Optimism rises but employment falls in the City
A report by the CBI and PwC shows the number of jobs in the financial services industry has continued to fall despite rising levels of optimism. It found that in the three months to March, 59% of firms were optimistic, while 9% were less positive, giving a balance of plus 50. Despite this, 46% of City firms said employment had fallen in the three months to March, while only 23% increased their headcount. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said banks were cutting staff to make "business operations leaner, refocusing activities as a result of new capital rules and regulatory requirements".

Santander targets small business lending
Santander is aiming to double its share of the small business banking market by the end of next year. The bank is extending its Breakthrough initiative, which is aimed at high-growth enterprises and small businesses more widely. Elsewhere, the Times considers a report by banking analyst Bruce Packard on the threats now emerging to traditional banks from smaller operations. The report examines the growth of different business models, such as peer-to-peer lenders and internet banks. He concludes that while “only a small minority of the new players have what it takes to turn the banking sector on its head”, some could pose “an extreme threat” to banking margins and profitability.

AIM-listed firms’ confidence dips
The latest quarterly sentiment index from BDO and the Quoted Companies Alliance shows that confidence has dipped amongst small listed businesses. It fell from 67.5% in October to 58.3% in January. Despite this, 66.2% of firms believed their own business would do well over the next 12 months. The cost of being on the Alternative Investment Market is now estimated to have risen to about £220,000 a year, with related costs such as finding non-executives more than doubling that, according to the survey.

Zurich accused of forcing SMEs into bankruptcy
Zurich is battling claims that its British subsidiary Dunbar Bank unfairly forced SMEs and property developers into bankruptcy. Dunbar is accused of doing so in order to quickly wind down its loan book after Zurich decided to pull out of the market in 2010. The Dunbar Bank Action Group is demanding compensation from Zurich over what it claims is the bank’s “aggressive” conduct.

FCA to examine pension charges

Swiss banking model is ‘dead’, says Abu Dhabi chief
