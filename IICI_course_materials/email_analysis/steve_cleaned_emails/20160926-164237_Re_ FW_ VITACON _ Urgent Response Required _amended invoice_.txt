Dear Steve,
I am writing with regards to
the company Vitacon Ltd. Could you, please, verify with your accounting department
whether they have received funds in the amount of 845 USD remitted by the
company Best Product Technology Ltd, Norvic Bank, Latvia as payment for Vitacon
company formation and downpayment for future orders? Actually, since funds have
been sent on September 21, 2016, the payment should have been already credited
to the bank account of AC Online Ltd.

Re: FW: VITACON : Urgent Response Required (amended invoice)
Dear
Steve,
Following
to my previous e-mail, I kindly ask you to confirm the receipt of funds in the
amount of 845 USD, being sent from Best Product Technology Ltd, Latvia.
Apart
from the above, could you, please, assist me with the following issues:
1. Does
Formations House provide bank introduction service in UK? Is it possible to
open a corporate bank account for Vitacon Ltd in any of UK banks without
personal presence of Ms. Bratushenko (company's director and account
signatory)? Here, it is worth mentioning that we will provide all the required
due dilligence documents, notarized and apostilled KYC, bank or credit card
statements, etc.
2. Does
Formations House provide accounting service? How much is your annual fee for
the accounting support, which includes submitting Annual Accounts to Company's
House and Corporate Tax Return to HMRC?
Your
early reply will be highly appreciated,
Regards,
Victoria
Becker

Dear
Victoria
Please
note that we do not have a Russian speaker in our office, it was just a favor
done to us by someone. However I have still forwarded information given by you
to our due diligence team and waiting for an update but we will need Certified
Translated Copy.
As
you know we are an English company and your company is being registered in an
English country therefore required documents must be submitted in English. And
in any country when you translate any document it requires NOTARY certification
to verify that given document is a TRUE COPY of original. Also in our very
first email s
ent
on
Wednesday, September 14, 2016 with subject ‘VITACON : Urgent Response
Required’ we have mentioned ‘
If the documents are not in English then you
need to have them translated and notarized. And send original and translated
copies.

Please
arrange the required document as soon as possible, so that we can further
proceed with your application.

Re: FW: VITACON : Urgent Response Required (amended invoice)
Dear
Steve,
In your
previous correspondence you have mentioned that the native Russian speaker
manager of Formations House had checked the proof of address of Mrs.
Bratushenko (utility bill) and had not found any reference to the apartment or
town. As regards to the apartment number, I have explained in my previous
letter that Mrs. Bratushenko resides in a private house. As regards to the town
issue, kindly note that the city (town) is indicated on the stamp ( Tiraspol
city - in Cyrillic Тирасполь) of the utility bill.
I will
very much appreciate if Formations House takes into consideration the above
explanations and accept the submitted KYC of Mrs. Bratushenko.
Kindly
advise whether we can proceed with the payment issue.
Your
early reply will be highly appreciated,

Dear
Steve,
It is good to hear that you found a native Russian who could check the
documents.
Thank you very much for your kind cooperation!
In addition kindly note that the UB does not contain an apartment number
because mrs. Bratushenko lives in a private house, therefore "48" it
is the number of the house.
Regarding the SIC codes please indicate the following:
46190
52241
52242
52243
In case of questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear
Victoria
Becker
Attach is
amended invoice.
KYC
documents:
- Proof of
id – passport is acceptable.
- Proof of
residential address is not acceptable, because:
1. It must
be in English. If document is not in English then along with original you need
to submit NOTARIZED English translation of the document.
2. We have the
document checked by a native Russian who said that “Passport is fine but the
proof of address does not show the apartment number or the town”. Therefore you
need to provide a document where we can verify Director’s name, and complete
address. We would prefer if you can provide latest credit card statement or
bank statement where issue date, name, address and account number must be
visible.
For SIC code, you
can only submit 4 SIC codes at one time, therefore please choose 4 SIC codes
from your given list and inform us.
Waiting for your
reply.

Re: FW: VITACON : Urgent Response Required (amended invoice)
Dear
Steve,
Following
to our phone conversation of yesterday, I kindly request the following:
1.
Please, confirm the receipt of KYC for Ms. Bratushenko - director, shareholder
and person with the signicant control
2.
I kindly ask you to revise the invoice as you forgot to add 65 pounds as
express mail courier fee for the next company, which I will submit for
formation in the nearest future. In this respect, please, recalculate the total
amount (it should be 630 pounds) in USD and EURO as per applicable converstion
rate.
3. Last
but not least, while submitting the application for Vitacon formation, I have
wrongfully specified some SIC codes. I kindly ask you to make some updates in
this regard on your side before submitting the application to Company's House.
The correct SIC codes for Vitacon Ltd are listed below:
46170
46190
46390

As per latest invoice sent by you in  total amount of  565 pounds,
kindly note that we would like to send 630 pounds instead,
because you forgot to mention courier delivery charges  for the second
company which will be registered shortly.
Please be so kind to revise the invoice by adding 65 pounds.
Looking forward hearing from you.
