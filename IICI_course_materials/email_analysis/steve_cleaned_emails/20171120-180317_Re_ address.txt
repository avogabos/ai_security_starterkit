Hi Steve
Just to check this is still the correct registered address
for Staff Travel Voyage Limited
Or is it this one:
The registered office of the Company is situated at the
offices of MAYFAIR TRUST GROUP
LIMITED, Second Floor, The Quadrant, Manglier Street, P.O.
Box 1312 Victoria, Mahé,
Seychelles.
I recall a previous email saying the original address on the
top had not changed becuase the company was formed previous to a particular
date, appreciate if can confirm.
Also is there a postcode?
Best
Phil
