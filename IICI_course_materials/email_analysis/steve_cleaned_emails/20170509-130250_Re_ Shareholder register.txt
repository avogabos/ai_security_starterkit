Hi Charlotte


Can you let me know if these changes have been made?


I am also being asked for an official shareholder register when these changes have been made - this is for a virtual office we are taking.


Thanks

Chris

Hi Charlotte


Can you advise how I can change the addresses of the members on the offshore companies Shareholder register.


Mine and Aleks' should be both - 24 Queens Gardens, Bournemouth, Dorset BH2 6BH


Also, Anthony should not be on the shareholder register for MC Capital anymore - how can he be removed?


Thanks

Chris
