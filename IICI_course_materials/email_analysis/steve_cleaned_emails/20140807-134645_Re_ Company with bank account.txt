Dear Steve Smith

Thanks for your reply.

We are not yet registered in the UK. We need a limited company 
registration and bank account in the UK. Your website offers a value 
starter pack for a UK company + bank account for Â£595? Is there any 
guarantee of success in opening an account? I know this is not as easy 
as it once was due to recent changes in regulations/legislation.

I look forward to your reply.

Regards
David
