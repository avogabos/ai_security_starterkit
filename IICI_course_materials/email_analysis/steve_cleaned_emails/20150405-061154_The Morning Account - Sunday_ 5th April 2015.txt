Osborne keeping his options open on tax cuts
In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, George Osborne says he is keeping his “options open” about the timing of any tax cuts should they win the election. The Chancellor said the Conservatives could move sooner on their plan to increase the threshold at which people are drawn into the 40p higher rate of tax to £50,000 by 2020. “It will depend on individual decisions in individual budgets,” he says. “We are absolutely committed to reaching that £50,000 threshold so you don’t have people on middle incomes increasingly sucked into the higher.” Mr Osborne would not be drawn on raising the IHT level to £1m, except to say: “We want inheritance tax to be paid by the rich.”

Kellogg’s acknowledges impact of tax avoidance clampdown
Kellogg’s has warned that a global crackdown on tax avoidance would result in a “material” rise in its tax bill. In its latest annual report the cereal maker said: “Contemplated changes in the UK and other countries of long-standing tax principles, if finalised and adopted, could have a material impact on our income tax expense.” The Sunday Times points out that Kellogg’s has six companies registered in Luxembourg which have been used as part of a wider structure to offset bills in higher tax jurisdictions. The firm said it was still studying the impact of George Osborne’s diverted profits tax on its British operation. However, it did not “anticipate it will affect business models such as ours”.

Labour will scrap married couples tax allowance
Responding to figures from the Commons Library which show that 59% of new jobs paying at most the minimum wage are held by women, Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said Labour would raise the minimum wage to £8 per hour and give tax rebates to firms who pay a living wage. The figures come amid claims from Labour that the married couples tax allowance will help just 660,000 women. Ed Balls said Labour would introduce a new lower 10p starting rate of tax instead which will help over 10m working women. The married couples tax allowance comes into effect tomorrow.

Second Scottish council uses buildings tax break
The Mail on Sunday reports that Inverclyde Council used a controversial tax avoidance scheme to finance an office upgrade saving it £1m. The move may have cost taxpayers £1.5m in lost receipts, the paper claims. Clackmannanshire Council was also shown by the Mail to have exploited the Business Premises Renovation Allowance, which gives investors short-term ownership of the buildings plus a loan from the council. They renovate the buildings and deduct the full cost from their personal tax bills. Clackmannanshire’s move is said to have cost the taxman £3.6m.

PENSIONS

Opportunities and pitfalls of pensions changes
Several papers offer advice ahead of pensions rule changes that come into force tomorrow that will mean anyone over the age of 55 will be able to take what they want, when they want, from their pension funds. The Mail on Sunday provides a brief overview while the Sunday Times’ Ian Cowie offers tips to help identify fraudsters attempting to part pensioners from their cash and highlights the protection offered by the FCA and the FSCS. Elsewhere, the Observer’s Simon Goodley relates the story of a German financial adviser who was kidnapped and tortured by pensioners whose £2m of savings he had lost, while the Sunday Express believes most savers will be sensible in their choice of investment. The Sunday Telegraph’s Richard Dyson reminds readers that new tax rules applying to pensions also come into play with pensioners able to pass on pension assets outside the saver's estate for inheritance tax purposes. Mr Dyson provides a comprehensive overview on tax relief and lifetime allowances with additional insight from Saffery Champness partner Lucy Brennan.

Pension firms failing to communicate changes
According to a survey commissioned by PwC, 74% of 50- to 75 year-olds said they have not been contacted by their pension provider to discuss the retirement changes which come into force tomorrow and will allow the over-55s will be able to cash in pension savings rather than buy an annuity. "After a year of highly publicised reforms and huge changes for both the industry and the consumer, one might expect the quality of pension provider communication to be above and beyond that of other sectors and this is not the case," said Jonathan Howe, Head of Insurance at PwC.

INDUSTRY

Firms fear parent pay legal risks
New research shows one in five firms are set to raise the pay of employees taking shared parental leave to match that offered to women on maternity leave with many doing so in fear of being sued for discrimination. Berwin Leighton Paisner partner Marian Bloodworth said that although some employers, such as Deloitte, Shell and PwC, are offering enhanced shared parental leave pay in line with their maternity packages as part of their commitment to diversity and supporting families, others are following suit because of the legal risk of not doing so. Chris Tutton, employment law partner at Irwin Mitchell, added: "Whilst most employers are familiar with how to manage and communicate correctly with employees on maternity leave, shared parental leave will pose new challenges."

Lehman creditors could see £6bn returned in interest
The Sunday Telegraph reports on last week’s Court of Appeal hearing that paves the way for PwC to return £6bn in interest payments to creditors of Lehman Brothers. PwC, Lehman's administrators in Europe, has already returned almost £35bn to creditors and are still winding up the remainder of the bank's London operations.

SMEs

MEPs demand digital VAT rule review
Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder has sent a letter signed by 33 MEPs from 16 countries to Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, demanding the EU reviews new VAT rules which they say could kill off thousands of microbusinesses that sell digital products. Critics say the rules, designed to stop multi-nationals undercutting rivals by setting up in low-tax countries, are too complex for small firms. Ms Bearder said: “Europe can only build the digital giants of tomorrow if it nurtures the small companies of today.”

BBB target pension funds to boost SME finance
The British Business Bank is targeting pension funds, insurers and other institutional investors to increase the amount of money available to SMEs, according to chief executive Keith Morgan. "We are thinking carefully about how we can get more investors into providing venture funding,” he said.

Caan steps down from Start Up Loans Company
Former TV Dragon James Caan has left the Start Up Loans Company, which lends taxpayer cash to budding entrepreneurs, at the end of his three year term as chairman. The company administers a £130m scheme and has backed 27,000 new businesses so far. The new chairman will be Mr Caan's deputy, Luke Williams.

ECONOMY

Alexander: UK would be a "catastrophic mess" under Labour
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has told The Sun on Sunday that Labour "can't be trusted" by working people and would lead the country into a "catastrophic mess". Mr Alexander said Labour was not "on the side of cutting taxes" for its traditional supporters and accused Ed Balls of running scared from a debate with him. “Ed Balls is a recovery wrecker and if he were in charge of the public finances by himself it would be a big mistake for the country.” Mr Alexander also said the Lib Dems should be given the credit for the new £10,600 income tax threshold, which comes into force tomorrow.

Business leaders risk restoration of trust
The Observer’s Will Hutton contrasts the role of the Banking Standards Board, the board of which was completed by chair Colette Bowe last week, and the recent letter to the Telegraph from business leaders backing Conservative policy. Mr Hutton identifies some of the signatories as “over-ambitious accountants and ex-financial controllers who love the adrenaline rush of deal-making but have got lucky, or just narrowly escaped the disastrous consequences of their actions” and describes their letter as “embarrassing and disproportionate” while making a “mockery of the notion of a free, independent press or business as trusted, impartial members of civil society.” If business is to be more trusted it should lean more towards the new Banking Standards Board than becoming propaganda pawns for Cameron and Osborne, Mr Hutton says.

May’s role in EFG loan for constituent questioned
Theresa May has admitted to having lobbied on behalf of a convicted criminal who sought an Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) to cover relocation costs of his business. Charles Henry Mogford’s Land Rover dealership in Maidenhead was given a £500,000 EFG loan from Barclays to finance his business, Auto Ex Limited, but it was put into administration 15 months later owing over £1m to more than 120 businesses and individuals. Begbies Traynor, Auto Ex's administrators, said creditors will not receive a penny. A spokesperson for Ms May said she “did not at any stage provide any assistance to Mr Mogford in obtaining any kind of loan, either via the EFG or any other scheme."
