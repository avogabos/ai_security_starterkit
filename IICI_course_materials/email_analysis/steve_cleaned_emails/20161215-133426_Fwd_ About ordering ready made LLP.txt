Subject: Fwd: About ordering ready made LLP
From: "Jussi Hallikas | Novasigma Ltd" <jussi.hallikas@novasigma.com>
To: steve@formationshouse.com

Dear Steve,
We have ordered from your company incorporation services couple months ago.
I think you have been talking with our COO Mr. Antikainen before.

We have a new client who needs a company which has been registered before
2014 to provide consultation services for clients outside UK. Client has a
Finnish passport and we helped him to get a new tax residency from Republic
of Georgia couple weeks ago.
We have suggested him to set up a Scottish LLP and we noticed you are
offering ready-made companies. He saw your name list but wasn't happy any
of names on the list so he asked how difficult is to change the name of the
company after the order?

Partners of this company will be our client by himself as a private person
and Novasigma Ltd (Gibraltar or Seychelles)

Could you please provide details what this offer (£10.000) will include as
the price is quite high comparing to many other companies who are offering
same type of packs? Is there going to be any additional fees upon this or
do you think our client will need extra services from your company to get
started with this company by offering his/this company services as a
consultant/sales person to the Georgian or Cayman entity?

We can have a phone meeting about this case as our client is a bit in hurry
so you are free to call me anytime.

Thank you very much.
