Hello,

Before I place any orders, can you please send me via email a sample Certificate of Good Standing and Certificate of Incumbency, so that I can verify with the bank which document is more appropriate, and if it complies with their requirements. Based on the information from the website, I assume that both documents are the same price.

Thanks,
Dinko Georgiev
