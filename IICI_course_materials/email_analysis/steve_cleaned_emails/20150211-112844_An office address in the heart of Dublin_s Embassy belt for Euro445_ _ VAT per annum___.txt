We've traded from our Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 address (

) for over 
                              10 years now and that's the location we make available 
                              to clients using our Registered Office Service for 
                              just
€445 + VAT
per annum.
This service is perfect for:
local start-up businesses needing an address for incorporation 
                                purposes and going forward

                                clients who need a presence in Ireland without 
                                the expense of establishing a full office
