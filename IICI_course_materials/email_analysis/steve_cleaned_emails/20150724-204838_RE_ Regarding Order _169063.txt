Hello Steve,

Sent you an email reply back on Wednesday and is there a reason getting a
reply back from you is so poor?

Our offshore purchase was not fully delivered and you failed to continue
communication when banking and merchant accounts became available.

Now that I am following up with you, I have to continue to get delayed
replies on our issue.

Please let me know on this and look forward to your update.
