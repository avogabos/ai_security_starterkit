Diverted profits tax set for April introduction
Attempts to rush the pre-election finance bill through parliament have been criticised. The bill, which was published on Tuesday and is expected to gain Royal Assent on Thursday, paves the way for the introduction of the new diverted profits tax at the start of April. Companies will be exposed to a tax rate of 25% on profits that are deemed to have been diverted to lower tax countries. However, Heather Self of Pinsent Masons stated: “Legislation this complicated should not be going through without parliamentary scrutiny.” Ian Young of the ICAEW said this year’s legislation was on course to match the average of at least 500 pages of tax legislation passed in each year of the coalition government.

Osborne: bank levy here to stay
George Osborne has said that the bank levy is to become a permanent fixture of the tax system, in spite of financial institutions becoming less risky. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, has suggested the levy should be scaled back as banks became less dependent on an implicit state guarantee. However, Mr Osborne stated: "The reason for the bank levy is to create a safer banking system but also explicitly to raise revenue," adding: “I think the bank levy is here to stay.” The BBA said banks already paid more than £40bn in tax and that a rise would hit competitiveness.

Balls: Labour will not hike basic or higher rate of income tax
Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has pledged not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax should Labour prove successful at the General Election. He also ruled out an increase to VAT. In response, the Conservative Party have claimed the pledge leaves Labour with no option but to impose a “jobs tax” of higher NI or income tax to meet its commitment to slashing the deficit. Meanwhile, the Mirror claims millions of families could be hit with a fresh tax increase after George Osborne refused five times to rule out raising VAT.

Chancellor should encourage, not ignore, OTS advice
Writing in the Telegraph, Jonathan Riley of Grant Thornton questions how much attention is being paid by George Osborne to the recommendations of the Office of Tax Simplification. He suggests that when the chancellor referenced the OTS in the Budget, it sounded like he was “neutralising an organisation that could be used to strike at the heart of aggressive tax avoidance.” He adds that a failure on the part of the Treasury to act on the advice it has received from the OTS has been to the detriment of the economy.

HMRC launches fresh Archant tax inquiry
Regional publisher Archant, which is already facing a £14.8bn tax bill, is to be the subject of a new HMRC investigation over an additional £6m in alleged unpaid tax. The inquiry focuses on a “legal reorganisation” that the group underwent in 2011, when 40 of its trading companies were reduced to three. In a letter disclosing the investigation, Archant chairman Simon Bax reassured shareholders that the “company has never acted to illegally avoid tax”.

FCA targets financial crime
The Financial Conduct Authority has announced seven key risk areas as part of its 2015-16 business plan, with financial crime added to the list and house price growth - which has slowed in recent months - dropped since last year. However, the FCA said that it would continue to monitor house prices as well as consumers' ability to cope with a potential rise in interest rates. The regulator also said that it would investigate "dark pools", asset management fees, pensions and how insurers gather data on their customers.

Finance bosses’ lack of qualifications costs billions
A new study conducted by the AAT has discovered that a third of those responsible for finances in SMEs do not hold a relevant qualification. As a result, British companies have lost an average of £1,277 each, consisting of tax miscalculations, which cost roughly £508, unpaid invoices, which account for £399 of the total and payments bouncing, which cost firms £257. The research also found that three in five SME owners are responsible for their company’s finances on a day-to-day basis, with just 26% having dedicated members of staff in charge of accounts.

Annual inflation rate falls flat
Official statistics show that the UK’s annual inflation rate fell to 0% in February, down from 0.3% in January and below economists’ projected 0.1%. The cost of transport, food and non-alcoholic beverages fell 0.4% in the 12 months to February, while core inflation rose 1.2%, down slightly on January’s 1.4%.

Female boardroom representation increases
The latest report from Lord Davies has found that women still account for fewer than one in 10 of the top executives at the UK's biggest public companies, despite the gender gap narrowing. The latest annual progress report shows 8.6% of executive directors at FTSE 100 groups are women, an increase from 6.9% last year. Lord Davies hailed the progress, declaring: "What we have in fact seen taking place is little short of a revolution in boardrooms of FTSE 100 companies." Sharron Gunn of the ICAEW stated: “You can't just evaluate success or failure on how many women are recruited into board positions... businesses need to measure the success of their leaders by how well they support diversity and inclusion.”

Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the committee, also said that other topics that the new panel might examine could include competition in banking and tax policy.
