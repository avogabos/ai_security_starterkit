Subject: Question about ESOFT LTD's tax returns and annual accounts
From: rana risheh <ranarisheh@hotmail.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Dear Steve,


I hope my email finds you well.


I would like to ask about filing ESOFT tax returns and annual accounts.

Usually, I buy the accountancy service from Formations House. But because ESOFT doesn't really trading and I have only few records to be prepared, I feel like I can do it by myself. My question here is:  do you think it is possible for the financial statements to be prepared by me or it should be issued particularly by the Formations House?

In case I can do it, can you please lead me to what should be done after preparing the ESOFT financial statements for the year ended April 30th 2016? I would turn to buy the accountancy service if I found the process difficult to be done.


Thank you very much.


Regards,

Rana Risheh

ESOFT Director

Dear Steve,



I hope you are doing well.

I have received this email yesterday from the support team. Can you please let me know what I have to do with this letter? Is it just a notice to send the Annual Accounts (which is due by 31 Jan 2017 ) or it is something else.



Thank you very much.
