Dear Liza
Since filing of Confirmation Statement (Annual Return) is already OVERDUE and Registered Address service is EXPIRED since June 2016 but still in use and will be in use until next few months after filing company dissolution application because company dissolution process takes 3-6 months to complete we advice that you should do the filing, renew the service and then file company dissolution application.
Reason for filing Confirmation Statement, if left OVERDUE, company will be dissolved while being in bad standing state which might effect future company formations by company directors.
Reason to renew Registered Address service is because when we file company dissolution application, company registrar takes 3-6 months to close the company till then company is active, therefore any official mail can be recieved on the address which might be important to you and if service is not renewed then you might miss any important official mail.
Total cost for filing confirmation statement, renew registered address and filing dissolution application will be:
- Confirmation Statement Filing : GBP 15 (before 27-Nov-2016)
- Registered Address : GBP 100
- Dormant Company Dissolution Filing : GBP 75
