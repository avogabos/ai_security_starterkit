Hi Steve

can you please proceed with our application for the chamber of commerce document? Like I mentioned before:

Our bank requires some documents which shoes that we are egistered at teh chamber of commerce. You said that this is not the case. So please organize sth which is most similar to this, so that we can show the bank a document which shows at least somewhere on the letter “chamber of commerce” or any similar official document.
Please advise which document could be helpful for our matter.

Before you confirm the order for these documents please send me the total costs for the document itself and for the express service



Best regards,
