Hello Steve,


When we discussed with our management team are not ready to open the account in Cyprus and Latvia, because these both countries having trouble in money laundering. 


To travel to UK we need to apply for the Visa which would take some time. Or do you have any other option to open the account in UK. 


Regards

Sureshkumar, K

Dear Sureshkumar, K


The documents will be acceptable.


To open a UK bank account, company director/s presence will be required to attend bank meeting in London. If company director/s can visit UK, then we can certainly open UK bank account for your company.


If company director/s cannot visit UK, then best option is to go for an Offshore Bank Account, which can be opened without presence. We can open offshore bank account in:

- Cyprus
- Latvia


If you require further information or assistance you can contact me at info@formationshouse.com or steve@formationshouse.com or 0044-(0)207-016-2727 Monday to Friday 12pm to 9pm GMT.
