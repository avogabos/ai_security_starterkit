Large accountancy firms target small business market
The Times’ James Hurley reports on the foray into the small business accounting market by the Big Four. KPMG is leading the way, he says, with its subscription-based service promising "unlimited" access to a dedicated KPMG accountant, costing £145 a month for a sole trader and £275 a month for a small business. PwC also offers an outsourced accounting service called MyFinancepartner which promises face-to-face guidance for £300 a month for two visits. According to Kirsty McGregor, founder of The Corporate Finance Network, SMEs could pay about £12,000 to a regional or mid-sized accountant. KPMG’s Bivek Sharma says the firm has won 2,000 customers since it launched its small business accounting division in January. Mr Hurley says the increasingly cut-throat world of large company audit work and the rise of online accountancy software companies have been key strategy drivers. However, some question the value of advice for small businesses from large accountancy firms, fearing they won’t get the more personalised business advice. These claim are disputed by Mr Sharma: "Our network and reach means that we can help with any issue a customer has. We can provide introductions to large customers who are already our clients. We work with so many people, we will know someone and we will pick up the phone. We have done that already."

Accountants are today’s plunderers of Africa
Tom Burgis reports on how Africa is being looted by the accounting practices of multinational companies and comments on how, despite help by other countries to help facilitate the return of funds stolen by corrupt politicians, there is no such consensus as far as accounting tricks designed to dodge tax are concerned. A key method of tax dodging in transfer pricing and African governments are starting to devote more resources to verifying the value of exports. An African Union panel led by former South African president Thabo Mbeki estimated $50bn was being lost each year through illicit outflows. Campaigners are calling for an overarching global system to police the tax affairs of transnational business.

At last, a hand to guide Blur CEO
The FT’s Kate Burgess looks at Blur and wonders if the Financial Reporting Council’s intervention over its accounts will be the last time it has to raise issues with the firm. Blur has been asked many times over the last two years to review its approach to booking revenues. Ms Burgess doubts Blur’s CEO Philip Letts will change his ways, citing other examples of AIM chiefs who have been forced to relinquish their grip on a business due to their propensity for serial transgressions. Blur has appointed two new non-executives and a non-executive chairman this month, and not before time, Ms Burgess concludes, hoping they will steer Mr Letts away from his previous practices.

PwC warns of increased tax scrutiny of asset managers
PwC has warned that founders, senior executives and top portfolio managers face increased scrutiny from tax authorities and the media due to increasing requirements for transparency. The FT notes that Fidelity, Henderson, Schroders and BNP’s asset management arm were among those fund companies named in the LuxLeaks scandal last year. Rob Mellor, a partner at PwC, said: “By 2020 it is expected that tax authorities will have the powers to impose much higher penalties, to demand real-time investor-related tax information from asset managers and have the ability to carry out much more detailed tax enquires than they do currently. Tax transparency will be a fact of life in financial markets by 2020 and the whole financial services industry will be expected to play its part in policing the global financial system.”

Ireland aligns with OECD reporting initiative
The Irish government is considering changing its tax regime to make those companies whose global headquarters are in Ireland obliged to provide more information about their worldwide operations to Irish tax authorities. The move, designed to align Ireland with the OECD’s package Beps (base erosion and profit shifting) initiative, will mean Ireland becomes one of the first to implement the OECD-led "country-by-country" reporting initiative, due to take effect for the 2016 corporate reporting year. The OECD has praised Ireland for its adjustments to its corporate tax regime in response to international trends. The EC is investigating deals between Dublin and Apple and arrangements involving Starbucks in the Netherlands, and Fiat and Amazon in Luxembourg.

AstraZeneca’s Dutch tax avoidance scheme
The Guardian reports on AstraZeneca’s tax arrangements claiming the company has used a tax avoidance scheme in the Netherlands to avoid paying tax in the UK, despite having made profits in 2013 and 2014 totalling more than £3.3bn. AstraZeneca conceded its Dutch arrangements involved some tax planning but said it had not made savings from the scheme and planned to close it ahead of new OECD rules. Stephen Shay, a senior law lecturer at Harvard Law School, said it was "hard to say" how the companies in the Dutch structure "have a real commercial purpose other than to achieve the tax outcome".

Cameron rejects tax credit rethink
David Cameron has rejected calls to rethink cuts to tax credits, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cuts were part of a "bigger picture" of increased wages and lower income tax. The PM challenged claims by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that it is “arithmetically impossible” for wage rises to make up for the tax credit cuts.

Minimum wage rises could hurt SME jobs
David Norgrove, the head of the Low Pay Commission, has warned that the planned increases to the minimum wage could cost more than the 60,000 jobs predicted by the OBR. Mr Norgrove said he was particularly concerned that SMEs would be hit hard by the changes, which could see the rate rise to £9 per hour by 2020, as by then roughly 3.8m people will receive it and they will largely be employed in small firms in the retail and hospitality sectors. Meanwhile, a Federation of Small Businesses survey of 1,261 members found 38% expected the new national living wage to hurt their business when it comes into force in April 2016. Elsewhere, the BCC attacked the Chancellor over plans to extend shared parental leave to grandparents. "Another change to parental leave policy is the last thing businesses need after a decade of upheaval.”

Interview: Keith Morgan
Keith Morgan, chief executive of the British Business Bank, is interviewed in the Telegraph. Mr Morgan says the BBB has been instrumental in the growth of alternative finance models – from crowdsourced cash to asset finance, bonds and invoice-based credit. However, some observers say that although the BBB has provided cash for loans made by RateSetter, MarketInvoice and Funding Circle, their success has not been reliant on the BBB. Others say the terms of BBB’s investments risk artificially propping up the market. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says: “Time will tell if BBB is doing the right thing. My inclination is that it carries more dangers or problems than it solves.” However, Morgan says that, unlike many private sector lenders, the Government doesn’t mind waiting years to see a return. “Businesses need patient capital,” he states.

KPMG’s SME division works well for Beauchamps
The Times looks at access to Big Four firms for SMEs. Kirsty McGregor, founder of The Corporate Finance Network, says: "They are fantastic brands that used to be inaccessible to small businesses." One early adopter of KPMG's small business division, Alex Fagan, the founder of Beauchamps of London, a luxury leather company, says: "I thought we'd be too small for KPMG, but actually their small business accounting service works really well." However, Bobby Lane at Shelley Stock Hutter warns that SMEs finding themselves in a dispute with a large firm or bank their accountancy firm also works with might find themselves side-lined in favour of the more lucrative contract.

Economic uncertainty increases among UK CFOs
A survey by Deloitte has found that 60% of UK CFOs think China's slowdown will hit their businesses while three quarters say the level of financial and economic uncertainty is above normal, high or very high, up from 55% in the preceding quarter. Only 49% said now was a good time to invest, down from 59% in the second quarter. "Softening demand in emerging economies, greater financial market volatility and higher levels of risk aversion make for a more challenging backdrop for the UK's largest businesses," said David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte. Just 48% saying they would take on workers in the next year, compared 70% in the second quarter, while only 41% expected increased capital expenditure, down from two-thirds. Deloitte’s chief economist, Ian Steward said: “Despite the more emollient tone from central banks, CFOs still see tighter monetary policy as the number one threat to their businesses.”

Davies: Fear remains chief defence against fresh crisis
Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, told the Times’ Literature Festival yesterday that despite moves to force banks to hold more capital and improve their internal controls, the global financial system remain unbalanced. “There’s a whole bias in the tax system towards debt as opposed to equity capital,” he said, adding: “We have done quite a bit on the regulatory side, but not enough on the macro and tax side, which would be important to ensure that we do not get the kind of explosion of cheap credit in the future, which we had in the past.” Sir Howard said fear was currently the biggest defence against a repeat of the financial crisis, but the “half-life of fear is not so long and we could get back there again.”
