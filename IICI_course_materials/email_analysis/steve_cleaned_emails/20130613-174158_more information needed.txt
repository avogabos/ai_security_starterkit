  Dear Steve,

   

  Thank you very much for the detailed answer.

  I have the following question - one of the requirements is Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) . Can these be on the name of my daughter or should they be specifically on my name? 

   

  And also - can you recommend an accountant in the region of Stockport, Manchester?

   

  I would be interested in Vacation Ltd in your list of travel & tourism but how can I be sure that this company is OK. Where can I see the financial status of this company?

   

  Thank you for your support in advance.

   

  Kind regards
