Dear Steve,
Thank you for your prompt reply. I tried paying for the VAT registration via credit card but the payment failed. I will pay with bank wire.
The address that we have is the one on Harley Str. that you provide. Is it valid one?
What Accounting service you would recommend?
Kind Regards,
Svetoslav
