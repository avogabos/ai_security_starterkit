FYI

 Taking into consideration the global trends in relation to the companies
from offshore jurisdictions (B group companies), we would like to draw the
attention of our partners and customers to the perspectives of using the A
group companies (eg. Europe, OECD, Hong-Kong, Singapore).

2. A minimum balance requirement is introduced:
- 5,000 Euro for tariff plan A companies;
- 10,000 Euro for tariff plan B companies.

All changes will take effect from 1 June 2015. These changes apply only to
the accounts of legal entities.
More detailed information on the upcoming changes can be found on the Bank's
website by following the link:
