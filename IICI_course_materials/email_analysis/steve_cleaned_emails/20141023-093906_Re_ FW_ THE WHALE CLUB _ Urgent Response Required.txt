Steve,

Attached is the completed manual form.  As for the online payment 
process, I was on the phone with Verified by Visa yesterday afternoon 
and they have registered this card for this transaction but there 
appears to be some issue with your interface into their system.  
Hopefully the manual process will work.

Thanks for your assistance,

Mark
