Good morning Steve 

Please find attached a copy of my passport and a utility bill showing my address and name. 

I called your office last week to check what I needed and this was all that was asked for. It did say in your e mail 3 months of utility bills etc but the person I spoke to said it was a bill that was not older that 3 months you wanted.

Any questions please call
