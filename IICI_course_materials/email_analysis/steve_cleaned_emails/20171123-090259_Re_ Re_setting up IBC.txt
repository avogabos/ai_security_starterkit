Hi Steve,



Thanks for your prompt reply.



In fact it will be a small businnes company ( turnover +/- 40 K€ )

Main financial transactions will be from Morocco / Spain / Belgium / Germany & France to my account.

Is there any of these countries that not allow transactions to Belize or Seychelles?



Can you open a bankaccount in France for this company?



And what is the cost for all of this?



Waiting on your reply.



Rgrds



Koen
