Dear Mr Abergel,

I have had a undertaken your credit search that that has come back as ok,
however I have identified that your name appears back to front at Companies
House.

For example your name is according to your passport is *Abergel Abraham
Albin *and at Companies House your name is showing as *Albin Abraham
Abergel *so unfortunately  I am unable to proceed at present until you
complete  the following:-


   - Submit a CH01 form to Companies House to change your name to *Abergel
   Abraham Albin *and provide a copy of the CH01 form to me.
   - Ask your accountant to confirm that you are the shareholder of the
   business in writing, as the shareholding is showing your name as *Albin
   Abraham Abergel also.*


Please see attached a template of the letter that your accountant needs to
complete.

Please can you ask your accountant to put the letter on his or her headed
paper, includes registered number and business name and is signed by him or
her.

Please can you scan and email me the documents asap.

When I have the above information I will be able to proceed with a business
account. If you are unable to provide this information then I can not
proceed with your account as this is the banks requirement to open an
account.

Regards

Natalie
