Dear Partner,

We would like to inform you that there was a change in Rietumu banks
application forms for account opening (corporate clients as well as private
individuals) due to the FATCA requirements. Threrefore we would like to
kindly ask you to use new updated bank forms as soon as you will have a new
client.

New updated bank forms you can find by following the links below:

Forms:

Samples:

Also, we have redrafted the questionnaires for bank account opening
accordingly, it is not necessary to use them in your daily work, but you
might find it useful when filling in the bank forms, please find attached.
