Hi Steve and Michael

 

Thank you for all your help so far.  Now hopefully you can assist again.
When we made the name change to Divergent Advisors from Faradi Price, I
never requested the domain names.  Are you able to get me
Divergentadvisors.co.uk and divergentadvisors.com?

 

Many thanks

 

John

Hi Michael and Steve

 

Thanks for all the help.  If as we discussed, you could chase down the
payment asap.  That would be really helpful.

 

I understand that the proposed name       Divergent UK cannot be had.

 

Could you please make the new name      Divergent Advisors.  From my
webcheck search, this should be available.

 

As discussed, this is time critical for us as we have arranged client
meetings for this week, so any way you can speed this process would be so
helpful.

 

Re the payment, as Shaun is aware, your online payment process failed at
every attempt on Friday, so I made a                  FasterPay payment of
£25 on Friday from my company bank account at RBS.  I copied details of the
confirmation to Steve.  Here is an additional cut & paste from my bank

Hi John,

 

Sorry, I misinterpret and thought that your request was for new company
formation and asked for due diligence documents if director would be a
different person from the one appointed for FARADI PRICE. Very sorry about
that. 

 

To change company, you can use Online Company Administrator service for GBP
25 (per annum) and this service is already active for FARADI PRICE. To
submit company name change request please go through following steps:

 

1. Login to your account at our website www.formationshouse.com

 

2. Provide Customer ID and Password to login.

 

3. Click on 'UK Company Admin"

 

4. Select the company, if you have more than one company.

 

5. Click on 'Online Company Administrator'

 

6. Click on 'Change Company Name'

 

7. Type in new required company name and hit search.

 

8. If it shows that company name is available then hit 'Continue' link or
provide alternate names until available.

 

9. Select required information and click 'Submit'

 

- If you select 'Same Day Change' (8 working hours Monday to Friday after
payment is received) : cost GBP 125

- If you do not select same day change then it will be processed within 5-7
working days and cost GBP 25

 

10. Proceed and provide payment details and checkout.

 

Company Name Change will be processed as soon as payment is received.

 

Once company is changed, companys certificate of incorporation will be
replaced by Company Name Change certificate it will be use as company
certificate of incorporation.

 

Regarding availability of company name, I have checked with Companies House
and it seems that company name Divergent UK will be rejected because a
company name DIVERGENT LIMITED (09426220). Words like THE, AND, UK,
INTERNATIOAL are not considered as pat of company name. Therefore please
arrange alternate company name.

 

And just to let you know if you are registering a new company and directors
are same as previous company, then due diligence provided is acceptable if:

 

- passports are valid

And

- proof of residence is dated within last 3 months of the new order

 

Otherwise, we need to do due diligence again.

 

Regards,

 

Steve..

Hi Steve

 

Really?  You had all of the due diligence less than a month ago when you set
up the company.  This is only a change of name request.  Not a new company.
Am I missing something here?  As a banking Compliance Officer, I know very
well the Due Diligence Requirements of the HMRC ML Regulations.  We have
fully satisfied this already, less than a month ago, and therefore as an
existing customer/relationship this is not necessary again.  Can you please
explain why you need all of this again?  And while we discuss, and
potentially have to gather these docs again, is there any way you could you
at least reserve the name so we dont lose it?

 

 

Thanks
