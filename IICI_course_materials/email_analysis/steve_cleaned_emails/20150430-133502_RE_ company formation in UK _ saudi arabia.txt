Hi

I have speak to live chat with "Athena" and she/he refer me your email.

I want to buy the UK company with trading history for the purpose of open
the branch company in Saudi arabia for the contracting and industrial
projects. Please I need to clarify the following question to proceed this.

1)      I have no much experience in corporation rules,  regulations,
directors, partners arrangement etc. I am simple operation manager who can
lead and manage the projects and staff.

2)      I am working more then 12-15 years  in Saudi arabi and having many
opportunities to do the business here in Saudi.

3)      Sagia (Saudi arabia) allow foreigners to open and start business in
Saudi arabia. The only foreign companies can open the branch company in
Saudi arabia to start business here.

4)      So I decided to buy the UK based readymade company and open the
branch here in saudi and I shall declare myself as  general manger/director
and run the business

5)      I want to ask you if I open the branch here as  "uk company branch"
do I need to pay any tax to UK. Just for your information Saudi take 20% tax
upon profit. If registered as a branch they will be required to submit the
accounts for the branch and enclose the accounts for the company, tax is
payable on the UK business only though

6)       Do formation house shall provide all the services to provide the
required documents with attested from Saudi counslate.

7)      Please send me some options of readymade companies with min 2 year
trading history, VAT/tax paid, certified financial statement, maintained
bank account etc. - we don't have any with VAT

 

Please guide me to proceed this
