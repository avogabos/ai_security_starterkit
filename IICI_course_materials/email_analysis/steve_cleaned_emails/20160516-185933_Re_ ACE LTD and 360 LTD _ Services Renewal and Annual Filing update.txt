Dear Ng Kok Kiong

Please confirm if ACE LTD is a trading company or non-trading company.

Regarding 360 LTD, please note that non-filing or late filing will impose financial penalty on company. If you do not wish to keep the company you can file company dissolution application before the annual filing due dates.

Regards

Steve...
