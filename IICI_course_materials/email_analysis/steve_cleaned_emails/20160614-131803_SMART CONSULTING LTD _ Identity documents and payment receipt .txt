Dear Steve,

 

Thank you for your email. I have attached scans of my passport and a recent
credit card statement.

 

I have also paid the sum of £265 by BACS Faster Payments to your Santander
account and I attach a screen shot of the successful payment.

 

Please note that my assistant had incorrectly transcribed my date of birth
in your system. My correct date of birth is 5th March 1961. Do you have the
online filing PIN from Companies House so that I can update the companys
registered office and my appointment details?      

 

There was a second company of yours that I was considering purchasing but
when I tried to select it just now, the system said that it wasnt
available. Please could you verify the status of Ideal Digital Ltd? Many
thanks.  

 

Regards,

 

Alison Crawford
