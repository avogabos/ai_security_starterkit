Re: Dubai Islamic Fund Management Limited, this company name has an issue
with the name as per Registry
The company name(s) in the following application(s) require(s) further
consideration by the Companies Registry. If you choose to proceed with the
submission, the lodgement fee will NOT be refunded if the company name is
subsequently rejected. Further, your application cannot be processed within
the pledged time. If necessary, you may check the reason(s) for further
consideration of an individual application by "Offline Submission".
