Subject: utility billd you will find my utility

attached bills as I got them

edf : electricity look at the lower right corner you will find flash code

if you flash with a bar code reader in your mobile phone

it will open a website that will verify authenticity of the document


Free : is my home phone internet and phone provider on the upper right you will find a bar code that is verifiable


on any android phone you can use this app :

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scanbuy.flashcode&hl=en

hence the banker also can check these

as far as I know our mayor's office will not certify anything

please check with bank if these document are satisfactory to them

but I shall try

warmest regards
