Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that we provided you with the payroll software to prepare the payslips of your employee. However, you were facing problem using our software and we kept on updating you about how you can use our system effectively.
Further, if you wish, we can generate the payslips of your employee(s) on your behalf. But, as you may know that you need to report and e-file the payslips as soon as you pay your employee, your payslips of Feb15 and Mar15 are relating to previous tax year of 2014/15 and you need to contact HMRC and need to request them to allow online e-filing of the payslips as the last date for e-filing for tax year 2014/15 was 19th Apr15.
Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.
Regards,
Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
