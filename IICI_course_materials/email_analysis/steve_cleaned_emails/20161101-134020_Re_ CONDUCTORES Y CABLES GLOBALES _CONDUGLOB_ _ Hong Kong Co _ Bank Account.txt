Dear Angela
Thank
you for sending the consent, I will update once it is received.
Also regarding
bank account, we have not charged the payment yet, please confirm that we can
charge payment for service using the card details you provided earlier at the
time of company formation order. And should we charge for both companies or for
Hong Kong company only to start the process and charge for BVI company after
company registration is complete.
Waiting
for your confirmation.

In other hand, ​at the beginning of
our aproach to Formations House, we were told that with you we colud have all
the process done and we are really in need of the companies to be ready and
with their accounts open as soon as possible, this is what Oliver wrote to us:
"
Dear
Messin
Thank
you for your e-mail
I
need same documents (notarized) that I have asked in my previous e-mail
And also
the same information that I have asked in my previous e-mail.
The
charges for these services are as follows
1 BVI + Euro Pacific Bank Account  -
1600 GBP
1 HK Company + Euro Pacific Bank account –
1000 GBP
Best

Oliver

​
​So I dont understand
when you write
"
Please note that whether
to allow bank account opening or reject it depends on the bank and whatever the
situation our service charges GBP 500 are non-refundable

Please

one problem and due to that application is in pending. The Hong Kong registrar
is not accepting special characters in company name and company name by you
have special characters as ‘brackets’ – ‘CONDUCTORES Y CABLES GLOBALES
(CONDUGLOB) LIMITED’. Please confirm how company name should be registered with
special characters?
For
example, company name can be registered as ‘CONDUCTORES Y CABLES GLOBALES
