Hi Steve
I am making a Will at the moment here in UK and the company doing it for me say I cannot put my share assets in my Seychelles companies into my uk estate for the will
So I wonder am I am able to file something with you to say in event I am run over by a bus or such like! that I approve in advance for my shares in the ibc company Global Tourism Investments to be transferred to my children and wife? Could this be  in for eg the shareholders agreement or noted somewhere so you or indeed any other firm could act on it re moving the shares in such an unfortunate circumstance?
Appreciate thoughts
Phil
