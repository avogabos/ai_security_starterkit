Hello Steve,

Thank you for you feedback.  I have forwarded the request to my wife and she said in her attached email that she already forwarded you this information in December when you requested it from us.  Do we need to go have copies made of everything again?  I thought in the package we chose you were handling all the preparations for us?


Thank you for your feedback
