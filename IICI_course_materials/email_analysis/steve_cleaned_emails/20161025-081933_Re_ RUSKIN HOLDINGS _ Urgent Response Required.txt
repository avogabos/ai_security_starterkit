Dear Stephen Castledine

 

 

Thank you for your order for UK company formation 'RUSKIN HOLDINGS LIMITED'.

UK regulations now require us to establish the identity of all customers that we are providing services to. Please assist us in completing due diligence by providing color scan copies of following documents for company directors and shareholders ‘Mr Stephen John Castledine' and ‘Mrs Jennifer Castledine’.

 

Please make sure that scans are clear and in readable size and format.
