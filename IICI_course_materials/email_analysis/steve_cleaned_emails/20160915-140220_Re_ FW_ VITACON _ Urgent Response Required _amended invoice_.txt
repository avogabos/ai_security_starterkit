Subject: Re: FW: VITACON : Urgent Response Required (amended invoice)
From: Victoria Becker <cooperation24h@gmail.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Dear Steve,

Following to our phone conversation of yesterday, I kindly request the
following:

1. Please, confirm the receipt of KYC for Ms. Bratushenko - director,
shareholder and person with the signicant control
2. I kindly ask you to revise the invoice as you forgot to add 65 pounds as
express mail courier fee for the next company, which I will submit for
formation in the nearest future. In this respect, please, recalculate the
total amount (it should be 630 pounds) in USD and EURO as per applicable
converstion rate.
3. Last but not least, while submitting the application for Vitacon
formation, I have wrongfully specified some SIC codes. I kindly ask you to
make some updates in this regard on your side before submitting the
application to Company's House. The correct SIC codes for Vitacon Ltd are
listed below:

46170

46190

46390

52241

52242

52243

53100

53202


Your early reply will be highly appreciated,

Best regards,

Victoria Becker

Dear Steve,
Please accept the KYC of Mrs Natalia Bratushenko.
As per latest invoice sent by you in  total amount of  565 pounds,
      kindly note that we would like to send 630 pounds instead,
because you forgot to mention courier delivery charges  for the
      second company which will be registered shortly.
Please be so kind to revise the invoice by adding 65 pounds.
Looking forward hearing from you.
Best regards,
Victoria Becker
