Dear Steve,
I am sorry for my late reply.
I need your help:
I followed your instructions and logged in: ‘To order new products and services click here <>’ and there is no the option to submit CONFIRMATION STATEMENT (Annual Return). I have attached a screenshot for you to see.
Please advice!
Thank you.
Kind Regards,
Irene
