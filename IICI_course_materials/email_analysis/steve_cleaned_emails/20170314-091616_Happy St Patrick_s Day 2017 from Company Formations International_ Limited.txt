The Real
sports finals on St Patrick's Day...
Séan Kavanagh showing his REAL colours

Friday 17th March All Ireland club SHC final is at 3pm Ballyea (Clare) v Cuala (Dublin),
Croke Park

As a Dub I am particularly pleased to see Cuala from Dalkey in the finals of the
 All Ireland Club Championships in Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day, after the parade.
AND... I am fascinated that a small club from Co. Derry - Slaughtneil, ALMOST had
a team in BOTH the football and the hurling finals.

Friday 17th March All-Ireland club SFC final is at 5pm. Dr Crokes (Kerry) v Slaughtneil
(Derry), Croke Park

In their remarkable journey to the Croke Park football finals Slaughtneil  reached
BOTH SEMI finals of the club championship, only to win in the football but lose 
in the hurling - which is still a monumental achievement in itself.
Slaughtneil will be now be striving to become the first Derry champion since Ballinderry's
win in 2002.
It is 21 years since a Kerry club was successful, when Laune Rangers triumphed in
1996.
No matter what way you look at it you are going to be in wonderful GOOD COMPANY 
in Croke Park on St Patrick's Day
It's all going to be fabulously exciting entertainment. If you look carefully you'll
spot me there in the front row.
And hey! You can still buy tickets for both matches.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first St Patrick's Festival was held over one day, and night, on March 17th 
1996.
Preparation for the St. Patrick's Festival used to take 5 months, but with its subsequent
growth, it now takes 18 months to plan for Ireland's biggest annual celebration.
Why was it started?
To offer a national festival that ranks as one of the greatest celebrations in the
world.
To create energy and excitement throughout Ireland via innovation, creativity and
grassroots involvement, and marketing activity.
To provide the opportunity and motivation for people of Irish descent (and those
 who sometimes wish they were Irish) to attend and join in the imaginative and expressive
celebrations.
To project, internationally, an accurate image of Ireland as a creative, professional
and sophisticated country with wide appeal.

Here's something that you probably never knew
Patrick's colour is blue.
The original colour associated with St. Patrick is blue, not green as commonly believed.
In several artworks depicting the saint, he is shown wearing blue vestments.
King Henry VIII used the Irish harp in gold on a blue flag to represent Ireland.
 Since that time, and possibly before, blue has been a popular colour to represent
Ireland on flags, coats-of-arms, and even sports jerseys.
Green was associated with Ireland later, presumably because of the greenness of 
the countryside, which is so because Ireland receives plentiful rainfall. Today,
 Ireland is referred to as the "Emerald Isle."

Here's something that you probably never knew
Patrick's colour is blue.
The original colour associated with St. Patrick is blue, not green as commonly believed. In several artworks depicting the saint, he is shown wearing blue vestments.
King Henry VIII used the Irish harp in gold on a blue flag to represent Ireland. Since that time, and possibly before, blue has been a popular colour to represent Ireland on flags, coats-of-arms, and even sports jerseys.
Green was associated with Ireland later, presumably because of the greenness of the countryside, which is so because Ireland receives plentiful rainfall. Today, Ireland is referred to as the
"Emerald Isle."
Happy St Patrick's Day
