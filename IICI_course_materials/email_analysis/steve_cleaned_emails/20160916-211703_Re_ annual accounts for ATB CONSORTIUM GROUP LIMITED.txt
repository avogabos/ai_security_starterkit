Dear

As
you know that we take payment upfront for the services that we provide,
therefore in order to start working for the preparation Annual Accounts and Tax
Returns we must receive the payment first. Please arrange payment as soon as
possible.
Note
that last date for Annual Accounts filing for company
ATB CONSORTIUM
GROUP LIMITED is 31
st
October  2016 so we must prepare annual
accounts and tax returns by 10
th
October 2016 so that you can review
and approve the documents by 20
th
October 2016 and then we will be
able to do the filings before the due date 31
st
