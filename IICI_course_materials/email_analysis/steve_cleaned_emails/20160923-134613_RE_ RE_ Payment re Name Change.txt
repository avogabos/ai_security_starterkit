The payment of £25 for the name change has been made from my RBS account.  I cannot work out how to get the receipt but I have copied the screen confirmation into the attached.  Please check your account so the name change can be processed

Many thanks

Hi John,

Sorry, I misinterpret and thought that your request was for new company formation and asked for due diligence documents if director would be a different person from the one appointed for FARADI PRICE. Very sorry about that.

To change company, you can use Online Company Administrator service for GBP 25 (per annum) and this service is already active for FARADI PRICE. To submit company name change request please go through following steps:

1. Login to your account at our website www.formationshouse.com

2. Provide Customer ID and Password to login.

3. Click on 'UK Company Admin"

4. Select the company, if you have more than one company.

5. Click on 'Online Company Administrator'

6. Click on 'Change Company Name'

7. Type in new required company name and hit search.

8. If it shows that company name is available then hit 'Continue' link or provide alternate names until available.

9. Select required information and click 'Submit'

- If you select 'Same Day Change' (8 working hours Monday to Friday after payment is received) : cost GBP 125
- If you do not select same day change then it will be processed within 5-7 working days and cost GBP 25

10. Proceed and provide payment details and checkout.

Company Name Change will be processed as soon as payment is received.

Once company is changed, company’s certificate of incorporation will be replaced by Company Name Change certificate it will be use as company certificate of incorporation.

Regarding availability of company name, I have checked with Companies House and it seems that company name Divergent UK will be rejected because a company name DIVERGENT LIMITED (09426220). Words like THE, AND, UK, INTERNATIOAL are not considered as pat of company name. Therefore please arrange alternate company name.

And just to let you know if you are registering a new company and directors are same as previous company, then due diligence provided is acceptable if:

- passports are valid
And
- proof of residence is dated within last 3 months of the new order

Otherwise, we need to do due diligence again.

Regards,

Steve..

Hi Steve

Really?  You had all of the due diligence less than a month ago when you set up the company.  This is only a change of name request.  Not a new company.  Am I missing something here?  As a banking Compliance Officer, I know very well the Due Diligence Requirements of the HMRC ML Regulations.  We have fully satisfied this already, less than a month ago, and therefore as an existing customer/relationship this is not necessary again.  Can you please explain why you need all of this again?  And while we discuss, and potentially have to gather these docs again, is there any way you could you at least reserve the name so we don’t lose it?


Thanks

John
