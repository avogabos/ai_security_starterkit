Dear Steve,

which bank should i send the money to for the order of the gambian gbc2? Santander or Barclays? I got instruction for both.

Also, Zohra's offshore bank asked if you will provide a code to verify the authenticity of the gambian documents on the gambian on line registry, not just on your website: http://verify.icommerceregistry.com/ 

Thanks a lot

Mario
