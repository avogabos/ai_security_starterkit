Hi Charlotte, 

 

Sorry for the delay in reply as we have recently been trying to iron out some processes.

As such, kindly  note that we are required to meet at least 1 director/shareholder/beneficial owner in Singapore for due diligence purposes.

 

Please provide the Certificate of Incumbency and the M&A as well.

These documents need to be certified true copy by a notary public that can be verified through credible 3rd party sources.

 

As for the contracts, may I know whether you are able to translate it to English?

 

Lastly, may I know when would Mr Schneider be able to meet me in Singapore?

 

Thank you.

 

 

Best regards,
