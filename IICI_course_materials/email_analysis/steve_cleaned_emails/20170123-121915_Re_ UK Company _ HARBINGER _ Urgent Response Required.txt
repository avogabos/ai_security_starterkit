Dear Smith 
As per our telephonic conversation, am going to forward payment through our bank transfer (from Pakistan) whereas charges for each transaction is costly, therefore is this possible to send you all the payment in two transactions, where upon the registration of Company and VAT will pay the initial 500GBP and remaining on last activities including virtual office and other related services. 
Also want to mention that if there is any possibility of paypal can pay instant payment with any problem with low cost. Please advise  
Regards
Muhammad Tufail Sahar
