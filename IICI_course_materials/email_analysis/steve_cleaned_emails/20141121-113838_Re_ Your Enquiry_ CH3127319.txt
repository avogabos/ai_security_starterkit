Dear Sir,

BROADCAST MEDIA ZONE LIMITED

Thank you for your e mail 20/11/2014 concerning the restoration of the above company.

There are two procedures for restoring a company to the register, which are:
            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
            - Order of Court to restore the company to the register.

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  The Bona Vacantia waiver letter, details can be found on the Treasury Solicitors
website https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bona-vacantia

3)  Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending 29/04/2010 with filing fee of £40
     Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending 29/04/2011 with filing fee of £40
     Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending 29/04/2012 with filing fee of £40
     Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending 29/04/2013 with filing fee of £40
     Annual Return form AR01 for the year ending 29/04/2014 with filing fee of £40

4)  Accounts for the period ending 30/04/2010
     Accounts for the period ending 30/04/2011
     Accounts for the period ending 30/04/2012
     Accounts for the period ending 30/04/2013
The accounts for the period ending 30/04/2014 are due for filing by 31/01/2015, if the company is not restored by this date these accounts will have to be part of the restoration package.  There are no late filing penalties for the account as the company was struck from the register before the  accounts became due for filing.

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8), and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court.
