Dear Oliver

I spoke with you on the telephone just now. I wish to acquire a Seychelles
or Belize company. The company's activity will be to hold an existing
portfolio of commercial property charges and long term lease holds.

What information do you require from me? I am in London for 3 days from
Wednesday this week, and if necessary I can come to your office on Friday
afternoon.

Thank you

Yours sincerely

Gary Killmister
