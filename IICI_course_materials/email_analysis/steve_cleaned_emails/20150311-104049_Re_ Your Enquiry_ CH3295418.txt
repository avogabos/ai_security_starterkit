Dear Sir

Re: SUMMIT TRADING LIMITED       No. 7702567

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file the following documents, fees and late filing penalties:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual returns for 12 July 2012, 2013 and 2014, with a filing fee of £40.00 per form.

3) Accounts for the period ending 31 July 2012 and 2013. There are no late filing penalties for the accounts as they became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

4) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered online at
https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

Please note that the accounts for the year ending 31 July 2014 must be filed no later than 30 April 2015. If the company is not restored by that date, these accounts/ this document will also be needed as part of the restoration application.

Yours faithfully
