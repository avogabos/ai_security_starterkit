Hi Steve

I appreciate the credit, but from what you are saying it is only holding up
the Seychelles accounts.

This means the UK one is set-up?

If this is the case why don't we have the details of this account.

We need this and the VAT Registration this month.

Thanks
Chris

Dear Chris
The
issue is, Â RBS still have the original Seychelles documents. We have contacted
them to have a go about it as it is restricting us to get the next accounts
open.
Terribly
sorry...
For
advanced cloud we will give a credit of 500 to use for the uk company services
next year, as we are terribly sorry for the inconvenience
We
will continue to keep contacting the bank to get the docs and then process the
next account openings.
Regards
Steve

Hi
Charlotte
Thanks
for your time the other day, we both found it very useful.
Do
you have any update regarding the UK Bank Account/VAT registration.
We
have a current client that is being billed from another company and we are very
keen to move them over to ACS,
So
we really need everything setup in order for this to happen.
I
should also be hand delivering Anthony''s bank forms this afternoon.
Thanks
Chris
