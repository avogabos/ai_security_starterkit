Dear Steve
No problem, please ask them to see the website:
www.stafftravel.voyage/home
We are a global travel agency,
booking hotels all over the world for people resident in all countries around
the world...(similar to
www.booking.com
...t he difference being, and the simple reason why it is called Staff Travel,
is that our clients must be staff of airlines or travel agency's worldwide)
When enter the website they
will reach a sign in page so they can simply put in their email or if they
don't want to they can enter seychelles@stafftravel.voyage and select travel
agent as employer type.
An IBC is particularly relevant
to us as our system books hotels for people anywhere in the world to travel
anywhere in the world, so for eg someone in New York booking a hotel in Hong
Kong, someone in London booking a hotel in Australia, someone in Bangkok
booking a hotel in Canada etc etc.
Our clients wherever and
whichever country they live, after booking their hotel through us, they then
buy their own air ticket and fly to their holiday destination and pay the hotel
directly for their stay.
Then the hotel sends us our commisison element for the
booking. Our contract with the hotels will be with Staff Travel Voyage Ltd in
the Seychelles.
(I realise we will not be able
to take bookings from people resident in the Seychelles as this would
consitutue doing busines sin the Seychelles.)
I hope that clarifies things and hope we can set things up right away.
Best regards
Phil Dobson
