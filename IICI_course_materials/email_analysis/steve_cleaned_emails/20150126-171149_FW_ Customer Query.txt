Hello Mr Solakov,

I have spoken to my manager and unfortunately we won't be able to assist you
in this.
However, if you still need to form the companies with same nominee director
and shareholder for each, and order apostille and certificate of good
standing, please do not hesitate to contact me, I will be more than happy to
assist you.

Best Regards,

Delphine
