Dear Steve,
Kindly note the below Company that I’ve ordered new,
I’ve made a mistake in the company name. The correct name was suppose to be DIGITAL ADLABS UK Limited.

Can you please make the adjustment and rectification ?

Additionally,
I’ve another company ACCEALOR EUROPE LTD which was not incorporated by you,
but I want to bring the company under Formations House so that we can manage the company seamlessly and avail all the online company management facility like the way you provide by default for companies getting incorporated by you.

Kindly,
respond asap
