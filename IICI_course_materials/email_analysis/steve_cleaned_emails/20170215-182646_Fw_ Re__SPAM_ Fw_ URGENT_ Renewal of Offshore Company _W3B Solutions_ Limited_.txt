Many thanks


Does your credit card form work yet, as every time I've tried before if has just had problems.


Can you sent me your bank details and what details I need to include in the reference to renew W3B Solutions Ltd for £400.


I do not need the other 2 services so you can remove those please.


Many thanks

Martin Benwell
