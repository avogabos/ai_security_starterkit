Hi Steve,

Thank you for setting up the InfiniOffice Order Information

 

How do I ask the answering service to answer as follow:

 

AGENT: Thank you for calling the HP Dermatology Centre. How may I help?

PATIENT: (The customer will say something)

AGENT: I am afraid that all of our consultants are busy at the moment with
other patients. I will ask them to call you back as soon as a consultant
become available.

AGENT: What is your mobile?

AGENT: Name?

AGENT: Problem concern?

 

Also how do I give the text for the afterhours answering machine? Or
afterhours forward calls?

 

Regards,

Ben
