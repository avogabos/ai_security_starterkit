Hello Steve,

I just did as promised the bank transfer payment for the 325£ for the Registered Address and the Virtual office Infinity Mail. AND i’ve added as i told you on phone 30£ to be put in Neverland Editions « wallet » to pay for the mail shipping of the letters, so i’ve sent in fact 355£ ( see PDF of the bank confirmation below ). I’ve added the 30£ because i can’t put money in the wallet directly from my Mac on your site, it just doesn’t work.

Thanks to add these 30£ in the wallet and to ask for the forward of all letters which are waiting for at the usual address that you have for me in Paris.

Best wishes,

Alain Littaye
