WITHOUT PREJUDICE

 

Sam,

Hi.

Please see the email below.

This has been a scr*w up of major proportions so far.

I have been waiting weeks and weeks and weeks to register a Seychelles
company with near-identical bespoke Mem and Arts as those for a company
which I registered through you guys 2 years ago.

I have also been waiting weeks to register a plain vanilla HK company, which
I was promised within a few days.

I have investors I am about to lose because I cannot produce the paperwork.

I can get no response from Steve at your office.  The original lady - who
appeared to be capable - sadly went away on leave.  At this rate she will be
back soon - but by then you I will be dealing with another company if this
is not 100% sorted.

If I do not have DEFINITIVE dates when all this will be resolve by end of
business UK time tomorrow Wednesday 26th March 2014, I will charge back the
fees you have taken to my credit cards and start over with a company which
has a clue.

I also reserve my position with regards to recovering any damages from you
for consequential losses which I suffer because of the delays you have
caused on this.

Sincerely.

Tim.

Hi there.

I have heard nothing back for 10 days regarding either the Seychelles
company or the Hong Kong  company

Please can you update me.

Please can you use this email address as I think Google were blocking your
emails for some reason.

This is now EXTREMELY URGENT.

Thank you.

Tim.

Guys

Hi there.

You gave me a quote which included the fees for reviewing the custom mem and
arts by counsel - that is what I paid for (!).  (You will note I have paid
to you far more than the standard fee for a Seychelles company.)

Furthermore these are nearly IDENTICAL to the custom men and arts they
already reviewed for U Say Ltd - which I also registered through you guys. 

(Please let them know your counsel this to save time.)

Please revert to me regarding the availability of the name as requested.

If you look at our website

 

www.republicgroupholdings.com <http://www.republicgroupholdings.com/> 

 

you will see we are a hotel company.

This has taken a very long time this is now URGENT please. 

Many thanks.

Best regards.

Tim.

Hi Tim


We have submitted the name request to the Registry and will revert as soon
as possible. However, please note that as the name bears the word 'republic'
the Registry may request for the intended activities before considering
approval. As such, please provide. (Also, the word 'republic may be on their
list of restricted words forming part of IBC names). 


As regards to the Memo & Arts, please advise that if the name is approved
for incorporation, we will need to engage our legal counsel to review the
entire Memo & Arts before we are able to lodge same with the Registry.
Please note that counsel's reviewing fees will apply.


Attached is the Memo & Arts.
