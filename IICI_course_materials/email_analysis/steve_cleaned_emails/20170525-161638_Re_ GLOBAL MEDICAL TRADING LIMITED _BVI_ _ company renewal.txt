Dear Steve,

We have seen your e-mail and immediately called the bank who are in the process of acquiring our stolen money. You have openly admitted it is a technical fault and are withholding our funds from us through your faulty payment system. This is openly theft and if not returned promptly we will be pressing charges. It is beyond illogical to keep money that you unlawfully took through your poor payment system which is based on trust. You have completely lost our trust and the trust of others using your website, we will ensure that we will put a complaint forward and publicise this ridiculous situation unless you apologise and comply with the return of the funds. 
You can not steal and then say it is company policy, that is unheard of.

Also, can you please explain who you are and what your position is in the company?

Thank you,

Therefore we can either provide you with credit note on 3 renewal orders anduse the amount for any of your future orders or we can renew your company fornext 4 years.
