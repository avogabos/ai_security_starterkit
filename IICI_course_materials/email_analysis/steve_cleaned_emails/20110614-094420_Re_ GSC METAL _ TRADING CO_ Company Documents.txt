Hi Steve,
thanks for feed back. How much it cost and how long it would take to get VAT registration?

Other question: What it mean for the UK law miss the VAT number? I explain better, till now we have not used the company yet...... but  ......if we would have used it issuing and receiving invoices, opening bank accounts, move money in and out......... how could we do it without a VAT number applied? I wonder if the VAT number for UK comapny has the same meaning of the rest of Europe, otherwise till now we have had a company not ready to be used. I'm wrong? 
Can you please explain me shortly. Thanks Steve!

Distinti saluti

Re: GSC METAL & TRADING CO: Company Documents
Hi Steve,
thanks again for sending us the company's documents so
quickly. We appreciate!
I have a short question, which I hope you can answer me.
Which is the "VAT" registration number of our company? I mean.....
You know that the EU companies has a VAT number, which in some cases correspond
with the fiscal code of the company, too.
I
don't know if it is the
same for the UK, by the way, what I need to know is this number or its
equivalent of GSC Metal&Trading Co Ltd. Thanks for your info by return.
