Dear Maria,



Re: Fast & Simple Solution Ltd – company seal



The courier company in Ukraine is trying to get to contact with you in order
to delivery your company seal. The telephone number that we have on file
(004402076124502) is not working. Please could you kindly provide a contact
number. The seal is still in customs.

Kind regards
