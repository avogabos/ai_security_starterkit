Can we change registered agent choosing your and can you follow these 2 companies and renew them when necessary (may 2016)?

Dear Steve,
which bank should i send the money to for the order of the
gambian gbc2? Santander or Barclays? I got instruction for both.
Also, Zohra's offshore bank asked if you will provide a code
to verify the authenticity of the gambian documents on the gambian on line
registry, not just on your website:
http://verify.icommerceregistry.com/
Thanks a lot
