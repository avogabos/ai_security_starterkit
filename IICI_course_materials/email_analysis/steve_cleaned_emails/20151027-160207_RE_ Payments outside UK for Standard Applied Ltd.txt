Firstly, drawings cannot be done in a company. Instead, shareholders of the
company can withdraw the money in form of dividends. Also, transferring the
company's fund can be done either as remittance, payment of invoice etc
which solely depends upon the decision of company's management.

Dear S. Smith,

 

I am now in process of making drawings for a machine line for food
production. This will be final in january 2016 for application for a patent.

 

My question is as the construction Company makes the drawings a will be paid
as we go. The Company is a Swedish Company. Can I pay as agent for Standard
Supplied Ltd. ? The invoice will be made in January with final payment. Best
regards Anders Faye-Wevle
