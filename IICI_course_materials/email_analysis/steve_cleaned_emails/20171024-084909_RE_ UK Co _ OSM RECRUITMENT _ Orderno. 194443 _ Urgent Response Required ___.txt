Hello Sarah.

 

Thank you for your email.

 

We wait for payment proof.

 

There is still time if you wish to change company name, please provide
alternate company name so that we can check the availability.

 

Regarding your proof of address the documents are dated  03 February 2017
and 15 March 2017, though I have forwarded these to our due diligence team
but I am not sure these will be accepted because proof of address document
should not be dated older then last 3 months. Therefore please arrange proof
of address document dated within last 3 months. Utility bills (water OR gas
OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (issue date,
name, address and account number must be visible)

 

Please do not send telephone, mobile, TV or internet bill, these are not
acceptable. If the documents are not in English then you need to have them
translated and notarized. And send original and translated copies.

 

If you need any further information or assistance, please feel free to
contact us at  <mailto:info@formationshouse.com> info@formationshouse.com
(Sales) or  <mailto:support@formationshouse.com> support@formationshouse.com
