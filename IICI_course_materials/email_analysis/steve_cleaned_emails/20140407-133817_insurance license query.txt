Subject: insurance license query

We can start processing the insurance licence upon receiving information on
the intended insurance activities and notes on who will be the directors of
the company.

 

We also need to know whether they will be supplying the 3 yr business plan.

 

Once we have this info we will be able to check with the Gambian licencing
team if there is a minimum capital requirement. From here we will invoice
for the fees of services you need from us as well as the licence fee. 

 

The bank account will  not be opened until after the full licence is issued.

 

Thanks
