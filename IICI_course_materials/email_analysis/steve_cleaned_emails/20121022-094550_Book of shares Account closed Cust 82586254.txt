    Hi,
I created Nothmann Research company using your service and I was granted 
the customer number 82586254, and I kept the Registered office ever 
since, until I closed this account on April and transferred my 
Registered Office elsewhere.

Now we need to change the shareholder. We are wondering whether you 
already keep the shareholder's record book as I didn't request it to be 
transferred, or if I have to generate and keep a new one.


Thanks,


Manuel.
