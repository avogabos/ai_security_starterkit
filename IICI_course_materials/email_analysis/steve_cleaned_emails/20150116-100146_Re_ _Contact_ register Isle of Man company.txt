Subject: Re: [Contact] register Isle of Man company

Dear Steve,
Please note we now don't normally  get directly involved with Isle of 
Man Company formations due to the onerous local compliance rules.
It is much better to use a locally registered agent for the Isle of Man.

We recommend Trident Trust and have copied in our local contact Heather 
Kent.

Thank you
James
