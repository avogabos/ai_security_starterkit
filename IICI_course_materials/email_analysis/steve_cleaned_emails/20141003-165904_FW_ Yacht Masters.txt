Please find attached an invoice for the renewal of services for the company
Yacht Master I Ltd.

 

Once we receive payment we shall file the annual return for you to ensure
the company does not get dissolved by Companies House as it is overdue at
the moment.

 

Please also confirm if you would like to file the Annual Return to state the
company does not trade at all, or if you would like to include a trading
activity.

 

All other matters I shall email you tomorrow,

 

Kind Regards,
