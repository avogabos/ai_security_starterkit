Dear Steve,
I hope you are doing well.I have received this email yesterday from the support team. Can you please let me know what I have to do with this letter? Is it just a notice to send the Annual Accounts (which is due by 31 Jan 2017 ) or it is something else.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,Rana Risheh
