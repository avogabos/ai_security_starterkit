Der Steve,

Kindly find attached:
1. Notarised bank statement recent by lawyer
2. Notarised bank statement 6 months by lawyer
3. notarised passport by lawyer 
4. notarised social security by lawyer (even though you did not request this I did it for further proof of address)


I will be sending cv and detailed business activity in a separate mail as this is too big and keeps coming back undelivered

Kindly confirm when you get all of the attached so that I can proceed with the next e-mail.

Kind regards,

Maria
