Dear All

 

From Wednesday  (29.1.2014) all express cogs will be ordered from Karachi.

 

This will be processed by preet or Bernard. Please note that cogs will take
between 24-48 Hours to arrive.

 

Once the cogs have arrived they will be scanned directly to the sales
persons for further instructions.( If you are ordering 'Cogs+ apostille
together', then please advise Preet, so that these orders can be processed
together.) 

 

With Regards, Tahir
