Dear Steve,

I would like to inform you that today I have talked to our clients, Mr. Chornyi and Mr. Volkov, who bought two Gambian companies and other related services almost a year ago. They are very upset because they could not use them in their business activity when they planned. Their initial demands were to reimburse their all their expenses. We tried to negotiate with them  alternative solutions and offered them other companies services. A few months ago they were interested to establish two UK LLPs in order to settle the issue with Gambian companies. However, today, when I transfered the information regarding the LLPs formation to Mr. Chornyi and Mr. Volkov, they informed me they do not really need any new companies or partnerships at the moment. Thus, they want to have their money back and would like to return to you both Gambian companies that appeared to be useless for them. Unfortunately, this is the final decision of Mr. Chornyi and Mr. Volkov. They refused to negotiate other ways of settlement of this awkward situation except full reimbursement of their funds according to their instructions.

Therefore, we kindly ask Formation House to reimburse expenses of Mr. Chornyi and Mr. Volkov related to two Gambian companies, i.e. Big Crown Ltd and New Imperial Ltd. Relevant invoices are attached.

We do not have any doubts in your fairness and understanding.

Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Andrei

 

 

Seychelles registry maintains completely confidentiality and do not disclose company director information to public.

 

 

We can provide nominee director for Seychelles companies but again it will be the same process, that we will register an offshore company with your given person appointed as director and that company will be nominee director of parent Seychelles company. And we cannot provide our nominee director for offshore companies. Also you will not be able open bank account if we appoint our nominee director, because bank would like to see the beneficial owner as company director.

 

 

So the structure mentioned in my previous email, will give you confidentiality with complete control over company and bank account.

 

 

Regards

Dear Steve,

Thank you very much for your email. I transfered information to our clients. They ask whether you may arrange a nominee director for Seychelles companies that will be appointed as partners of LLPs? What would be a fee for this service? Most probably the beneficial owners will apply for bank accounts by themselves.

Our clients ask whether the following names are available for LLPs:

1. Real Estate Solutions LLP
2. Real Estate Boutique LLP.

Best regards,

Yes it is possible to register new LLPs, the cost will be:

 

-        LLP Registration 500 GBP

-        Registered Address 25 GBP (for the 1st year)

-        Bank Account 500 GBP

 

As per above cost the 2 LLPs will cost 2050 GBP.

 

You will be required to appoint 2 partners for each LLP. If you need UK bank account then partners will be required to come to UK, otherwise we can open offshore bank account FBME. FBME is a Cayman Islands bank with branch office in Cyprus.

 

The LLP names are subject to availability. The name given you are already registered as private limited companies, therefore they might not be accepted, so we would advice if you can provide alternate names.

Dear Steve,

Do I understand correctly that the last column "cost" refers to the price of the shelf LLP? If this is the case I think that they are way too expensive for our clients and substantially exceed the balance that they have.

Would it be possible to establish two new LLPs:

1. Knowledge Digital LLP, and 

2. Standard Select LLP.

Could you please indicate what would be 'the additional cost' for a UK company provided that our clients has only received certificates of incorporation, M&As and shares certificates (all documents in electronic format). Therefore, they received services only for USD310. Other services/documents had been paid according to the attached invoices but were not received in fact.

Is it possible to buy this company as shelf ones provided that our clients will provide names of shareholders and directors later?

Re: New Imperial Limited and Big Crown limited
Dear Steve,
Thank you very much for your email.
Could you please indicate what would be 'the additional cost' for a UK company provided that our clients has only received certificates of incorporation, M&As and shares certificates (all documents in electronic format). Therefore, they received services only for USD310. Other services/documents had been paid according to the attached invoices but were not received in fact.
Is it possible to buy this company as shelf ones provided that our clients will provide names of shareholders and directors later?
Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Andrei
Unfortunately nothing has been materialised in regards to bank account for Gambia Companies.
We can provide UK ReadyMade companies and price starts from 165 GBP, you can view the list on this link:
http://www.formationshouse.com/search/readymade.php
Bank Account opening for UK companies is for 500 GBP. If need a UK bank account, company directors will be required to come to UK and meet the bank manager. OR if you choose offshore bank account with FBME in Cyprus branch, then company director presence will not be required.
You can pay the additional cost. Company will be transferred in 48 hours and bank account opening will take 4-6 weeks.
Regards
Steve
