Dear Sirs,


 


The director has no other proof of address that he can show other than this mobile phone statement. As explained, the utility bill sent to the address is not under his name.


 


Will you be able to incorporate a company with a nominee director instead in this instance?


 


I am doing this as a service on behalf of two friends who wish to incorporate a company. I will be giving you the documents of the Contact Person in an upcoming email if you are able to accept a mobile phone bill.


 


If you are able to accept the mobile bill, I will be able to make payment early next week. Thank you!
