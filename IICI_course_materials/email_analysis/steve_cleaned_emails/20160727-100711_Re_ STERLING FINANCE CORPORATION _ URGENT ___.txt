Dear Afees Dawodu
Thank you for visiting our office to make payment and submit documents for due
diligence.
However, we missed one information which was SIC Code (Business Activity) for
company. Please see the attach file and confirm the SIC Code (Business
Activity) for your company. You can choose up to 4 SIC codes.
Please provide above information as soon as possible so that we can further proceed

For company registration it takes 8 working hours after we submit application

Waiting for your reply.
