Hi Steve

Thanks for this

I look forward to hearing from you

I understand now that the bank account we will be opening will be in Latvia with Rietumu..

I see on their website that they offer multi currency accounts - is it possible to get an account with Sterling, Dollars, and South African Rand?

Matt
