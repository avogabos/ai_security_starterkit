TAX

Tax hike could be needed to reduce deficit
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, in response to a question asking whether Labour was "leaving the door open" to changing tax thresholds in the next Parliament, has said: "What I'd like to do is find ways I could have fewer people in the 40% tax bracket. Of course I would. But I have to be honest with people. The deficit will be £90bn. I have to find a way to get the deficit down in a careful, staged, balanced way." The remarks have stoked fears that middle earners including teachers, nurses and police offers could be pulled into the 40% tax bracket. Mr Balls added, however, that Conservative promises to raise the 40p threshold further "are completely unfunded and will cost billions of pounds."

Pro-Conservative business letter
Yesterday's letter to the Telegraph signed by business leaders supporting the Conservatives, emphasised job creation and praised the reduction of corporation tax. The letter urged voters to keep the Conservatives in power. The Guardian notes that there are names on the list who have a chequered history on tax. Rooney Anand, chief executive of pub chain Greene King, is on the list despite the fact that Greene King has been involved in a decade-long tax battle with HMRC; and George Weston, the chief executive of Associated British Foods, a company that has been accused of avoiding £10m tax in the UK a year by using a Luxembourg holding company. Chuka Umunna responded to the letter by saying that Labour would maintain a competitive tax regime while prioritising support for small firms by cutting business rates on 1.5m small business premises.

Historic day as Revenue Scotland launches
Revenue Scotland, the first national administrator of Scots-only taxes since 1707, has today begun collecting tax returns - as the Land and Business Transactions Tax comes into force and the power over landfill tax is transferred to Holyrood. "For the first time in 300 years, with the launch of Revenue Scotland, Scotland is able to collect and manage some of our own taxes... Revenue Scotland [has] worked incredibly hard to ensure a smooth transition today for taxpayers and I'm very grateful to them all," remarked deputy first minister John Swinney.

HP in talks with Deloitte
Hewlett-Packard is in talks with Deloitte over a potential settlement with the auditor concerning its role in the takeover of Autonomy. Last year HP restated the accounts of Autonomy subsidiaries to cut net profits to less than a fifth of what the company originally reported, and Deloitte signed off. Following the restatement, HP said last year it would holder the auditor "responsible for the wrongdoing that occurred". A source says that further talks are ongoing and that HP and Deloitte are likely to seek to avoid a mutually embarrassing public clash. It is understood that the two companies have signed a form of standstill agreement that is usually a prelude to an out-of-court settlement.

Global M&As soaring
The number of global deals jumped by 23% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, with cross-border deals accounting for $315bn. Some $902bn (£610bn) of mergers and acquisitions were announced, the highest three-month total since the pre-crash boom in 2007. In the UK, companies were involved in $61bn of deals, 35% more than the first three months of last year. Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A at JP Morgan, said: "The UK is likely to be at the forefront of inbound activity in Europe; it's an attractive market and growth dynamics are strong."

Top bosses' pay
PwC's analysis of the first 39 remuneration reports filed by FTSE 100 companies this year reveals that 45% of executives received no salary increase. This compares with 25% last year, although in one fifth of cases, chief executives chose to waive their salary increases. Bonuses rose slightly for the first time after three years of decline; and total pay for chief executives including salary, benefits and all incentive plan payouts increased by 0.7%.

FIRMS

Quindell understated profits
Professional services firm Quindell has admitted that the profits of the businesses it is selling to Slater &Gordon, had been understated by £17.4m, or 15%, in the first six months of 2014. Shares ceased trading for more than six hours yesterday as the group was forced frantically to recrunch the numbers behind its £700m deal to break up the firm. The finalised deal is for parts of the business accounting for more than 95% of the company's last reported adjusted pre-tax profit, leaving Quindell investors with an assorted selection businesses, whose adjusted pretax profits were just £8.5m in the first half of last year. A previous inquiry by PwC found that the group's accounting was "largely acceptable but at the aggressive end of acceptable practice."

Investment in London tech firms reaches new record
London's technology firms are attracting more venture capital financing than ever before, according to London & Partners. It said tech firms secured more than $682m (£462m) of venture capital financing during the first three months of 2015. The amount is more than during the whole of 2012, and a 66% rise on the first quarter of 2014. The previous record was $411.6m in the fourth quarter of 2014. WorldRemit raised the most, securing a $100m round led by Technology Crossover Ventures. Fashion retailer Farfetch, augmented reality advertising firm Blippar and music technology company Shazam were among others to announce significant funding details.

ECONOMY

Manufacturing continues to strengthen
Markit's purchasing managers' index for manufacturing hit 54.4 in March, up from 54 the previous month. This was an eight-month high for the index, and was in line with expectations. However, new orders went above and beyond, surging to 57.9, up from 56.4. Employment in the sector hit 73%, climbing for the 23rd consecutive month.

Election fears spook markets
With forecasters predicting a hung parliament the markets became edgy yesterday. The Times suggests that the prospect of a weak and ineffective government after a dead-heat election has caused the pound to fall against the euro and the stock market to become more volatile.
The Times, Page: 1, 2<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4399795.ece>

Productivity stagnating
Although productivity usually recovers quickly after recessions, figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that it has not bounced back since 2007. The ONS said that the seven-year stagnation in productivity is "unprecedented" in postwar UK history. It said that Britain's workers in 2014 still produced 0.4% less per hour than they did in 2007. Output per hour stalled last year falling 0.2% in the final quarter. That meant productivity last year remained "little changed" compared with 2013.

Swiss banking model still alive
Patrick Odier, chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association, takes issue with the chairman of Abu Dhabi's financial centre, who recently declared the Swiss banking model to be dead. Mr Odier says that Switzerland has changed: it has adopted international standards in tax compliance, including article 26 of the OECD model tax convention, several tax agreements and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), and it has agreed to adopt the new OECD Common Reporting Standard.

West End rates set for jump
West End retailers' business rates are to nearly double in the next two years to £290m. Bond Street, Regent Street and Oxford Street shops will see their bills jump 116%, 67% and 66% respectively - raising the government an extra £128.2m altogether, according to Gerald Eve. This is due to current valuations being based on appraisals carried out in 2008.
