Hi

With the formation in Gambia at present i have two companies and am a sole trader with a VAT number in Cyprus. I wish to separate my business activities as there two completely different companies. One company is a newspaper the other a TV subscription service provided globally.

I would like to create a separate legal entity for my TV subscription service offshore and continue with the newspaper as a sole trader in Cyprus.

I presume this is OK? and can be done with an offshore company in Gambia?

I understand the banking facility will be with FBMA Bank in Cyprus ?

Will the merchant account also be with FMBA Bank in Cyprus ?

Can you send me more details on the process with timescales and what is required.

Regards
