Hello Delphine,

Hope that you are having a nice day and wanted to get in touch with you
regarding our order #169063.

This order was placed and paid for many months ago on 02/08/2013. Though due
to various circumstances at the time with Formations House this was not
completed and all contact stopped with no updates.

If you would please get back to me I would like to discuss the options we
have available and appreciate your help.

Thank you and look forward to your reply.

Risbon
