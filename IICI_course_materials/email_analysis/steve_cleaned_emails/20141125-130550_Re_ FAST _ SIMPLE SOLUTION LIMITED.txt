Hi
Maria
Yes the
complete amount for renewal is GBP 215 which will include:
-
Renewal of Registered Address : GBP 100
-
Renewal of Online Company Administrator Service : GBP 25
-
Annual Returns Filing : GBP 15
-
Dormant Accounts Filing : GBP 75
You
need to renew the services and files annual returns by 23
rd
Dec
2014. Late filing of annual returns can cause penalties. However for Annual
Accounts that can be done in January.
Or if
you wish to close the company then the cost will be GBP 75 but you must place
the order this month Nov 2014. Otherwise in Dec you will need to renew the
service and file Annual Returns and then process company closure.
Regards
Steve
