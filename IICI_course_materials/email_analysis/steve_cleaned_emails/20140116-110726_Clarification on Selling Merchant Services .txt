HI

 

In light of some recent customer issues using our infiniapp merchant
checkout I want to make the process of accepting or offering our merchant
processing 

 

On formations house we currently sell packages that include merchant
accounts. When we sell this what the customer actually gets is the starter
infiniapp solution. We will give a coupon to enable them to go through
infiniapp and set everything up themselves.

 

Infiniapp provides a commerce interface for both web and mobile. It does not
actually take the payments on the merchants behalf instead it acts as a
gateway so the merchant has the interface to take online payments for mail
order services, if they need retail pos terminal for instore sales they will
need to get a card terminal from their merchant processing provider. The
merchant will create their store and add prodicts etc and then select who
their payment processor is and enter those account details. We are
integrated already with all major ones such as Paypal, Worldpay,
Barclaycard, Skrill and authorize.net. they will pay the card rate agreed by
that payment processor, plus 0.25% to us as the gateway provider as we
provide the security checkout for the merchant processor. 

 

Certain customers will be able to apply for an Outsourced card collections
service. This is our merchant processing service (instead of paypal etc) and
rates start at 1.5% but we will be selective on who we offer it to. There
will be an application form on a special site page where customers can
apply. In general it will be offered to low risk b2b service providers or
people selling clothes etc. if they sell high value goods like expensive fur
coats, mobile phones or other electrical goods we will consider the
application but the rate will be higher and we may refuse to offer the
merchant service.

If we agree to supply the service, there will be strict usage rules.

If the payment is taken online via web or mobile, the goods absolutely must
be delivered to the card holders address every time. If they want to take
payments by card in their shop we will provide a payment terminal (extra fee
of £25 per month and must have the top package) where the card holder will
use chip and pin or if no pin, they will sign the card receipt, if the value
of payment is over £500 the merchant will also need to take a photocopy of
proof of id. In all cases Amex will not be enabled as a payment option until
the merchant has 3 months clean history with us. If using our payment
processor the gateway fee of 0.25% is waived.

 

Customers can also buy infiniapp directly for £800 all inclusive, but bear
in mind they will still need their own merchant processing account with
paypal etc or apply for our one separately. The benefit they get with ours
is that we support all major processors so if they want to change processor
they dont have to change anything on the store system, and we support web
and mobile equally. In addition bear in mind the commerce store has
integrated back end accounting, so when they have to produce reports or
accounting information for filing its already there and easy to provide to
their accountant.

 

The content on all sites will be updated over the next few days but in the
meantime any customers you are offering our merchant services to, please be
aware of the above.

 

A merchant processor actually collects the money from the card holder.

A merchant gateway facilitates the merchant, customer and the merchant
processor to collect security information and pass on relevant information
between the parties. It is an interface the a merchant needs in order take
payments and get the merchant processor to authorise them and collect funds
