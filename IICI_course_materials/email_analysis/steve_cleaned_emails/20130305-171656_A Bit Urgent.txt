Dear Mam,
 
Greetings from Fortune Ventures Worldwide Limited and Siddhartha Das Gupta.
 
I hope everything is fine there.
 
Mam, I had  sent you and Mr. Steve a mail last week , but it might have escaped your attention.
 
Mam the company was formed on 7th of Jan 2013  almost 2 months  we are born but still we are unable
to operate due to the non opening of the Bank account .  I still cannot understand what is the problem and 
where are we stuck. I have given all the documents reqiuired by Mr. Raj Chott but till date nothing has 
happened. Would request to kindly ask him , if he is unable to open there are so many Banks who are ready
to give you facilities beyond expectation , just to get an new current account. Kindly let me know at the earliest
as to where we do stand.
 
Secondly I was awaiting for the details of the proposed US and Hong Kong office. Just after few days there is
an event coming up in Dubai where we are the Title Sponsor. I would love to give the address of the US and the 
Hong Kong Office. If you could kindly throw some lights on that as for the sponsorship the Flex , banners etc
has to be printed and there is no such time to delay it also.
 
I eagerly wait for your reply from either of you at the earliest. I hope you understand my pains and will help me
as you have always done.
 



With best regards and compliments.
