Guys
Hi there.
You gave me a quote which included the fees for reviewing the custom mem and arts by counsel - that is what I paid for (!).  (You will note I have paid to you far more than the standard fee for a Seychelles company.)
Furthermore these are nearly IDENTICAL to the custom men and arts they already reviewed for U Say Ltd - which I also registered through you guys. 
(Please let them know your counsel this to save time.)
Please revert to me regarding the availability of the name as requested.
If you look at our website

www.republicgroupholdings.com

you will see we are a hotel company.
This has taken a very long time this is now URGENT please. 
Many thanks.
Best regards.
Tim.

Hi Tim


We have submitted the name request to the Registry and will revert as soon as possible. However, please note that as the name bears the word ‘republic’ the Registry may request for the intended activities before considering approval. As such, please provide. (Also, the word ‘republic may be on their list of restricted words forming part of IBC names). 


As regards to the Memo & Arts, please advise that if the name is approved for incorporation, we will need to engage our legal counsel to review the entire Memo & Arts before we are able to lodge same with the Registry. Please note that counsel’s reviewing fees will apply.


Attached is the Memo & Arts.
