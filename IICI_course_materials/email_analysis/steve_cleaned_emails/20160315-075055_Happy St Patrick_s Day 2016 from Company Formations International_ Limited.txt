St Patrick's Day would be the same without our traditional Green Frog Story
A busy and dynamic chairman of a hi-tech association was crossing Northumberland
  Road as he headed towards the parade on St. Patrick's Day when to his great surprise
a green frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful
princess."
Without saying a word, he bent over, picked up the green frog, and put it in his
 pocket and continued on walking towards the parade.
The green frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a 
beautiful princess, I will tell everyone how smart and brave you are and how you
 are my hero."
The dynamic chairman took the green frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned
it to his pocket.

Dear Steve,
Happy St. Patrick's Day! And Happy Easter 2016 too!

SÃ©an Kavanagh

As the countdown to one of the biggest national celebrations in our history starts
in earnest this week we've extended our traditional St Patrick's Day Ezine to include
the Easter 1916 celebrations too.
In this special ezine we double-up on the celebrations and features.
Of course we still have our chuckle sheet to bring you a traditional good laugh 
on St Patrick's Day - we've been producing these sheets for more than a quarter 
of a century.
We've also included a fascinating list of Irish Registered companies that were around
at Easter 1916 and are still on the companies register today - a century later. 
See our 'test your knowledge' section below.
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Below in this issue you'll find
two pictures that very aptly capture how in two short weeks back in 1916, between
St Patrick's Day and Easter Sunday just over a week later, 'ALL,' as in those memorable
words of the poet Yeat's in his poem titled "Easter 1916", 'CHANGED - CHANGED UTTERLY
and a terrible beauty was born.
You find much to read, smile, enjoy and reflect on in this special issue of Good
 Company and on behalf of all of us in CFI... we wish you a most enjoyable St Patrick's
Day and a very happy Easter 2016.
Yours sincerely
Sean Kavanagh

Girls selling shamrock on St Patrick's Day 1916

How many of these six well known companies today were formed in Ireland before the
24th April 1916 - the date of the Easter Rising:

* Dunnes Stores,
* Musgraves,
* Nestle (Ireland),
* Robt Roberts,
* Veritas,
* Coca-Cola?
Surely Coca-Cola wasn't a registered Irish company in 1916! And how about Dunnes
 Stores... was that around in 1916?
The answer is...

Almost a half a million people have viewed this video - it's well worth a quick 
look

St Patrick's Day this year marks the countdown to the centenary celebrations of 
the anniversary of the Easter Rising in Dublin in April 2016.
The attached worcesterjonny YouTube video has some extraordinary contemporary pictures
of what Dublin looked like just a few short weeks after the St Patrick Day parade
so joyfully took place in O'Connell Street 100 years ago.
For the historians among us, it well worth watching. The lead-in is an ad. But the
1916 pictures that follow are utterly fascinating.

Statute Barred!
Amid all the rubble, devastation and chaos of Easter Sunday 1916 Nelson Pillar survived.
So also did the landmark statue of O'Connell, and the Father Mathew statue and many
others.
Although the odd pot shot was aimed at the statues by both sides, in general it 
seems that the statues were 'barred' from being the targets of gunfire. All, with
the exception of Nelson's pillar, remain today.

Let me leave you with the closing lines of
Easter 1916
by William Butler Yeats
For all that is done and said.
We know their dream; enough
To know they dreamed and are dead;
And what if excess of love
Bewildered them till they died?
I write it out in a verse -
MacDonagh and MacBride
And Connolly and Pearse
Now and in time to be,
Wherever green is worn,
Are changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.
