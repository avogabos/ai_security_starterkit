OK

 

Well we need to sensitively get as much information out of this customer

 

1.       We need up to date proof of address - times 2

2.       From where will the funds be sent, and what authority does he have,
ie. Is it his own bank account, will it be a solicitor etc.. then we can
request additional paperwork if needed

3.       We will also need to have for our records the purpose of his
purchasing this name, intended business and intended location of customers

4.       Does the new owner have any experience in the intended business
activity

 

Registered address will need to be moved before the next year. The first
year fees are higher due to the sensitive name nature

 

Also ask when we file the updated confirmation statement at companies house
they will ask to select wherever dormant or input a sic code, so customer
wil need to inform of

 

For anyone else appointed we will need

Passport

2 proofs of address

Position in the business

Background in industry

Share structure

 

Thanks
