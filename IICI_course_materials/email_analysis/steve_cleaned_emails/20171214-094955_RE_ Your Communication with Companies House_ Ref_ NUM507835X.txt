 Date: 14 December 2017

  

 Dear Sir

  

 INTRASIA COMMERCE LIMITED

  

 Thank you for your e-mail dated 12 December 2017.

  
 I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved because an annual return remained
  outstanding despite a number of letters being issued to the address listed as on our records as the registered office. This included one letter sent via recorded delivery. We also wrote to the director at the address listed as their service address. As we do not appear to have received any response, the Registrar of Companies had no choice but to believe that this company was no longer required and therefore took the necessary action to strike the company off the register.

 I can also confirm that the following documents and fees are required in order to apply for this company to be administratively restored to the register:

  

 Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website.

  

 Accounts for the period(s) 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013, 31 December 2014, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016.

  

 These accounts will not incur late filing penalties as they became due after this company was struck off the register.

  

 Annual Return(s) (form(s) AR01) for 14 December 2012, 14 December 2013, 14 December 2014 and 14 December 2015. These form(s) must be accompanied by a filing fee
  of £40 per Annual Return and can also be downloaded from our website.

  

 Confirmation Statement(s) (form(s) CS01) for 14 December 2016.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40  and can also be downloaded from our website. 
  Please ensure all the relevant Parts for this company are included.  A minimum of Part 2 is required.

  

 From 26 June 2017, only version 2 of the Confirmation Statement will be acceptable.  You can download the correct version of the form from our website.

  

 BV Waiver letter from the Government Legal Department.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at
 https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64.

  

 You should also be aware that a Confirmation Statement for
  14 December 2017 is due by 28 December 2017.  If this company is not restored to the register by the due date, then this document, along with a further filing fee of £40 will also be required in order for the company to be restored.

  

 I hope this information has been of some use to you.

  

 Yours faithfully
