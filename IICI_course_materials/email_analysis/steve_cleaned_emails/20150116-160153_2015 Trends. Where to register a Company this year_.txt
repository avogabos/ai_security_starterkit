** 2015 Trends. Where to register a Company this year?
------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly, it is not the fashion, but rational decisions that determine the right choice of company location.
Let’s review the list of top jurisdictions to consider in 2015 and the reasons why we think they will be popular:

„White-zone” offshores
Scottish Limited Partnerships (LP). Businessmen will still tend to register companies in non-black listed areas, i.e not in tax havens. Scottish LP fully correspond to the idea of a simple offshore (no taxation, no accounts filing and confidentiality), and (!) it is located in Europe.

Substance companies
Substance issues will remain top priority for many business people around the world. The entrepreneurs will search for fresh and not overused EU locations. Limited Company in Bulgaria correspond to all substance requirements.
