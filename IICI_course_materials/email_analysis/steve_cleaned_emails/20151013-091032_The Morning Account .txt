FRC issues complaint over PwC work for Connaught
The Financial Reporting Council has launched separate complaints against senior figures involved with Connaught, the former social housing maintenance firm which collapsed in 2010, and the firm’s auditor Stephen Harrison and his employer PwC. The FRC alleges that Connaught’s FD Stephen Hill, his deputy David Wells, Mr Harrison and PwC “fell significantly short of the standards” expected of accountants in the run-up to the firm’s failure. The directors “breached the fundamental principle of integrity” in the way they treated a short-term loan months before Connaught’s collapse, while PwC and Mr Harrison “failed to act with competence and due care” when auditing the group’s accounts for the year to August 2009, the FRC said. KPMG was appointed administrators of Connaught in 2010 and discovered 50,000 unprocessed invoices at the Leeds offices of the Connaught Partnerships social housing unit. In a statement, PwC said, "We are disappointed that over five years after the event the FRC has decided to pursue complaints against the firm. We have cooperated fully with the FRC throughout their lengthy investigation and will now consider its concerns and respond appropriately."

Companies pushing money-laundering checks on to NCA
Banks, accountants, law firms and other professional services companies in the City are offloading due diligence requirements related to the reporting of suspicious financial transactions on to the National Crime Agency, according to a senior NCA official. Companies are protecting themselves from punishment by submitting 14,000 “consent” requests to the NCA every year in what NCA deputy director Nigel Kirby describes as an abuse of the suspicious activity reports (Sars) system. Mr Kirby said the NCA is looking at proposals to end the consent regime. Transparency International has said the requirement on the NCA to respond to these consent requests within seven days was unrealistic for identifying cases of international corruption and had led to 83% of potentially corrupt deals being granted permission.

Hopes for Redcar dashed
The Official Receiver has ordered the Redcar steel works on Teesside to be shut down permanently after declaring that there was no realistic prospect of a buyer being found. Sahaviriya Steel Industries UK bought the site from Tata Steel of India, in 2011 but it collapsed last month with big debts and the loss of 1,700 jobs. Sue Jeffrey, leader of Redcar and Cleveland council, described the announcement as the "worst possible news and an absolutely heart-breaking moment for all of us".

Hospital FD paid £1m to cut costs
Campaigners have described the £1m pay package for Tim Bolot, interim finance director of Medway Foundation Trust, as "mind blowing". The failing hospital brought in Mr Bolot to balance its books in what is thought to be the most generous pay package given to an NHS chief.

PAC may call in Facebook
Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the PAC, has said she will discuss the possibility of calling Facebook before the Committee after it was revealed the firm paid just £4,327 in UK corporation tax last year. Meanwhile, the Times’ Hugo Rifkind says new media companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook pass the guilt of their ethical transgressions on to their consumers and show contempt for those who pay their dues. Elsewhere, the Mail argues that tax rules are outdated, noting that corporation tax accounts for just £43bn of the £672bn total UK take while HMRC estimates Britain's tax gap stood at £34bn in 2013, £3.5bn of which was estimated to be lost corporation tax revenues. The Guardian’s Aditya Chakrabortty points to AstraZeneca’s corporation tax bill of zero for both 2013 and 2014, despite racking up global profits in those years of £2.9bn, and says liaison committees set up by George Osborne have meant some of the country's biggest businesses have helped design their own tax regimes. Representatives from Astra and Vodafone were among those who advised the Government on how big businesses are taxed.

Cyber security breaches hit 74% of SMEs
In a supplement dedicated to cyber security, the Times’ Laura Whateley says that SMEs are particularly vulnerable to malicious attacks. PwC's 2015 Information Security Breaches Survey shows that 74% of SMEs have suffered a security breach, up from 60% in 2014. Andrew Miller, a director in PwC's cyber security practice, says: "The big news for SMEs is that they are not an unattractive target." Cyber security expert Robert Hadfield warns that costs associated with mitigating damage, penalties for not sufficiently protecting client data and reputational damage, risk putting SMEs out of business. The FSB says it is important that SMEs implement clear and concise procedures for email, internet and mobile devices and staff are trained in good security practices.

OakNorth begins cocktail adventure
Challenger bank OakNorth is backing Adventure Bar’s expansion plans, lending the cocktail bar chain 90% of the cash needed for a new site in Covent Garden and refinancing all of the company’s debt in a deal worth £650,000. OakNorth intends to lend £1bn to SMEs over five years. Lord Turner, former chief of the Financial Services Authority, who joined OakNorth's board earlier this year, said: "This is an area where some of the incumbents are very bad," he said of the UK's SME lending track record. He added that the ink was dry on "a number of deals" and that the total was "slowly ticking up week by week".
