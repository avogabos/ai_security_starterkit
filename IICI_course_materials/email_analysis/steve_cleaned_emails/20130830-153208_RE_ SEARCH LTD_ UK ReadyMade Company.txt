Hi Gary

 

 

We spoke on Friday 16th August 2013 regarding one of our UK readymade
companies 'SEARCH LTD'.

 

The actual selling price for the company is 25000 GBP and we can give you a
discount 5000 GBP discount. So you can purchase this company from us for
20000 GBP.

 

Please note that payment will be upfront and once we receive the payment and
due diligence documents, company will be transferred to you within 24 hours.

 

Waiting for your reply.
