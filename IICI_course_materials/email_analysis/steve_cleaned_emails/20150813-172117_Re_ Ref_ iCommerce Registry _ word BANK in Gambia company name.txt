Dear Mr. Ravin Chadha
Only using the word BANK in a company name
          do not allow the
          company to operate as a bank. To operate as a bank company
          need to have a
          banking license.
We can assist you in obtaining a Gambian
          Banking License,
          the cost will be as following:
BANKING LICENSE - 65000 GBP
Includes
Banking company registration
Banking license (provisional & final)
Process support consultancy
Upgrades:
Banking software - 15000 GBP
Banking website - 5000 GBP
Hosting for banking software & banking website - 2500
          GBP per
          annum
Applying for swift registration (after 6 months) - 12000 GBP
Company registration will be done in 48
          hours. Provisional
          license will be issued within 2 weeks and final license will
          be issued within
          3-4 months.
Please note that this license is not for
          consumer banking
          purpose, it is only for trade, finance and investment banking
          purpose.

Steve

Dear Mr. Ravin Chadha
Your details were forwarded to us
              from iCommerce Registry
              regarding Gambia company registration with the word BANK
              in company name.
Please note that BANK is a sensitive

              word BANK in a Gambia company name the cost of company
              registration is GBP 5000.
You can send few company names so
              that we can check the
              availability. Payment can be done online or by bank
              transfer. Once we have the
              order, payment and due diligence documents company will be
              registered within 24
              hours.
Documents required for due diligence
              for company
              formation:
Scan color copies of following
              documents are required for
              company beneficial owner/director/s and shareholder/s.
If company director a Natural
              Person:
1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
2. Proof of Residential Address -
              Last 3 months utility
              bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal
              bank/credit card
              statement. (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or
              internet bill, these
              are not acceptable.)
If company director a Corporate
              Entity:
1. Company Documents presenting
              beneficial owner name
              (Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles)
2. Proof of ID (Valid Passport) and
              Proof of Address
              (Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity)
              or latest personal
              bank/credit card statement.) of the beneficial owner of
              the Corporate
              body.(Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet
              bill, these are not
              acceptable.)
If the documents are not in English
              then you need to have
              them translated and notorized. And send original and
              translated copies.
