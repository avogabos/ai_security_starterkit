need 2 companies Scottish LP

One is the trading company with

 

-Elaboration and cosmetics domain. Assets are :

 

trademark-certification-website

 

No privacy > Bank account > French person as Director no anonymity required.

 

A standard ltd would suffice for this, or a normal English LLP though tax
would then fall into French standards which is quite high, so a standard ltd
is the way to go I think

 

 

Second is holding > privacy

 

For this second one, we need nominee service. 

We need to know more on the assets being held and the ebeneficial owner
befpore offering and again only an LTD is needed
