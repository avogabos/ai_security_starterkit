Hi Charlotte/Steve

In the absence of any replies to my latest emails, I have to make the
assumption that the only item you are waiting for is a Letter of Good
Standing from Anthony.

He will complete this and send to me soon.

The bank is also waiting for proof of address from Aleks, who has this in
hand.

Is there anything else?

I would appreciate a reply as its the only way I know if you need anything.

Regards
Chris
