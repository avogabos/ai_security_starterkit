OBR: Top rate cut cost £100m

New figures from the OBR have called into question George Osborne’s claim that cutting the 50p income tax rate increased revenue for the Treasury. The Chancellor said that his move in slashing the rate had led to an “£8bn increase in revenues from additional rate taxpayers”. But the OBR has now indicated that the spike in tax receipts from higher earners was largely due to people deferring payments until 2013-14, when the top rate was cut to 45p. The OBR also restated its assessment that the higher-rate cut is likely to have cost the exchequer £100m, adding: "We believe the original costing remains a reasonable guide to its effect on receipts." Jon Ashworth, Labour's shadow minister without portfolio, said: “This is an embarrassing slap down for George Osborne, whose claims have been called out by his own independent body.” The OBR has also calculated that the Government would have to raise taxes or make deeper spending cuts if immigration to Britain was reduced, as cutting inward migration would create "additional fiscal pressures."

Business rate tax relief dropped in last-minute budget change

The OBR says George Osborne abandoned plans to give Britain’s factories tax relief on business rates on the eve of this month’s Budget in order to pursue his goal of a £10bn surplus in the final year of parliament. The OBR revealed the decision was taken so late that its official forecasts overestimated the level of business investment in this parliament because there was no time to change the calculations. Robert Chote, the OBR chairman, said that the measure would have had a greater impact on business investment than any other single policy unveiled in the Budget. As a result, “the level of business investment is about half a per cent higher at the end of the forecast than the final policy package would suggest”, he said. Government sources said the policy would have given companies an allowance on business rates for plant and machinery, with estimates that the policy would have cost in the low hundreds of millions of pounds annually.

HMRC campaign used agency linked to tax haven

The Times reveals that a multimillion-pound HMRC publicity campaign to combat tax evasion and avoidance used an advertising agency ultimately controlled in an offshore haven. HMRC spent more than £6m on the campaigns, including £300,000 specifically on offshore evasion. Among the agencies used was TNS, whose ultimate parent company and controlling party is WPP, which is incorporated in Jersey. A spokesman for WPP said: “TNS is a UK company and therefore subject to tax in the UK, irrespective of its parent’s domicile.”

NI “stealth raid” criticised

George Osborne is facing criticism after it emerged changes to NI payments will see over 6m workers take home less pay. Experts estimate around 1.5m employees in the private sector and 5m public sector staff will be affected by the reforms, which could see someone on £40,000 lose as much as £40 a month from take home pay. Steve Webb, the ex-pensions minister, said: “I think the Chancellor had hoped that no one would notice this rather large tax increase smuggled out.”

SNP hits out at tax rise proposals

The SNP’s John Swinney has attacked Scottish Labour’s proposed tax increases. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, claims tax rises are essential to protect Scotland from cuts to education spending and wants to increase the basic and higher rates of income tax by 1p. But Mr Swinney said Labour was "determined to hit the poorest in our society with the cost of Tory austerity" and accused his opponents of failing to explain a proposed rebate scheme designed to protect the poorest for increases in the basic rate.

Budget leaves women worse off

Labour believes that women will be hit six times harder than men by the government's welfare and tax changes over the course of a decade. The party’s data suggests that 86% of net savings the Treasury is to make from tax and benefit changes between 2010 and 2020 fall on women, while only 14% have been allotted to men.

INDUSTRY 

 

Optimism falls in financial sector

Optimism in the financial services sector has fallen at the fastest rate since 2011, according to the latest CBI/ PwC Financial Services Survey. The quarterly survey of 104 financial services firms found that respondents in banking and investment management had seen the sharpest deterioration in sentiment - while optimism among building societies and in the insurance sector was broadly flat. Financial market instability, competition from within the sector and macroeconomic uncertainty were identified as the top three challenges facing financial services over the coming year. Nevertheless, business volumes continued to expand at a solid pace, while profitability improved, albeit at the slowest pace for almost two years, according to the survey's findings. Meanwhile, research by EY shows a 59% decline in the amount raised on London’s main and junior markets at the start of the year. In the first three months of 2016, 15 flotations raised £1.65bn while in the same period last year 13 listings raised more than £4bn. Finally, figures compiled by Deloitte show the value of M&A deals in which foreign buyers take over British companies is down by a third so far this year, compared with 2015.

PENSIONS

 

Savers withdraw £6bn from pension pots

Figures from the ABI reveal over-55s have withdrawn nearly £6bn of cash from their pensions since radical reforms were introduced a year ago, a lower total than some commentators had predicted. Yvonne Braun, director of policy for long-term savings at the ABI, said: "Following some initial pent-up demand, the number of people accessing their pension pot as cash in one go has settled down. People are taking a sensible approach and considering how they will pay for their whole retirement."

DB pensions ‘black hole’ grows

A study by JLT Employee Benefits warns that companies are facing an £800bn pensions ‘black hole’. The gap in defined benefit pension schemes has increased from £425bn to £800bn since 2006, despite employers pumping in contributions worth £160bn, the study found.
