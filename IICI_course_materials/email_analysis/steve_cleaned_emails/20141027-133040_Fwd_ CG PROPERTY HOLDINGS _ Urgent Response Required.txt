Dear Colin Hartness
Thank you for your order for UK company formation 'CG PROPERTY HOLDINGS'.
Unfortunately company name 'CG PROPERTY HOLDINGS' is not available for registration, because a similar name is already registered. Please provide alternate company names.
Note that to use the word 'Holdings' or 'Holding' in a company name, you are required to provide 2 existing company namesÂ  for which the HOLDING company will hold shares and percentage of share holding.
Also assist us in completing the due diligence by providing color scan copies of following documents for company director and shareholder.
1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
2. Proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.
Please provide us with above mentioned information and documents, so that we can further process you order.
If you require further information or assistance you can contact me at
info@formationshouse.com
or
