INDUSTRY

New rules shake up audits
The FT's Harriet Agnew examines how regulatory changes are affecting the accountancy industry. Following the financial crisis, regulators have introduced new rules aimed at disrupting auditor-client relationships, which have come under criticism for being too "cosy". Competition is therefore increasing, with Simon Collins of KPMG stating: "A greater proportion of our work is up for grabs than at any time before. The increasing scrutiny and restriction on non-audit services for a client means that many companies are tendering multiple services." PwC meanwhile says two-thirds of the 51 companies that have put audits out to tender since October 2012 have switched firms, while David Sproul of Deloitte, says: "We need to be agile as to how we move out of being an auditor for one company and into being an auditor for another. This is going to require a fresh approach."

FRC monitoring Tesco
Tesco is being monitored by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the SFO following Monday's admission that it overstated its half-year profit guidance by £250m. The FRC said it was "monitoring the situation closely," but would not act until Tesco's own investigation was completed. "It will consider the outcome of the investigation announced by the company and determine whether it should take regulatory action," the FRC said in a statement. Tesco has already launched its own investigation into the issue, which is being carried out by Deloitte, together with Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers. Tesco's auditor, PwC, has declined to comment on the supermarket chain's overstated profit forecast. In the Independent, Duncan Swift of Moore Stephens reflects on recent developments.

Rules won't curb mergers
Kenneth S Hackel, President of CT Capital, writes to the FT to suggest that the US Treasury's attempts to crack down on tax inversion mergers will only have a slight impact on M&A activity. "As long as foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates offer American companies significant and growing non-US sales and cash flow prospects, a strong incentive exists for a tax arbitrage," he states.

TAX

Labour tax plans get lukewarm response
An analysis by the Times shows 99% of people living in homes worth more than £2m would be expected to pay Labour's proposed mansion tax, despite assurances from Ed Balls that the asset-rich but cash-poor would be protected. The shadow chancellor suggested 50,000 homes would be affected, but the Times says Zoopla research puts the "true" figure at 108,000. Meanwhile, the Evening Standard reports that Labour's potential London mayoral candidates appear cautious on the prospect of a mansion tax; with Margaret Hodge, David Lammy and Lord Adonis all suggesting that reforming council tax may be a better way of raising additional revenues. A leader in the FT states that the mansion tax proposal has "several flaws" and would be disproportionately weighted towards London. The tobacco industry has also criticised Labour's plans for a £150m tax on the big cigarette makers to help fund the NHS, calling the move "illogical" and "unwarranted".

Scots tax issues remain
Edward Fennell considers the outcome of the Scottish independence referendum. He notes that issues regarding legal certainty and stability will remain while further devolution is agreed. Kirk Murdoch, chairman of Pinsent Mason's Scotland and Northern Ireland offices, states: "Tax planning will be difficult until businesses can understand how income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax may be devolved to Scotland and, indeed, potentially to Wales and Northern Ireland."
The Times, Page: 57<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article4216986.ece>

Taking a look at Twitter's taxes
Noting the current trend for many US technology companies to set up an offshore operation to ultimately avoid UK corporation tax, the Independent suggests that Twitter's annual accounts show the company is funnelling much of the revenue it generates in Britain through an offshore sales structure. As a result, a large proportion of Twitter's revenues from the UK are processed offshore, which the Independent says could help reduce its UK tax bill.

VAT equality day
Around 15,000 pubs and restaurants cut their prices by 7.5% yesterday to recognise 'Tax Equality Day'. It aimed to show the benefit of a VAT cut from 20% to 5%. Shepherd Neame Chairman Miles Templeman said that the brewery industry remained 'over-taxed' despite cuts to beer duty.

FIRMS

KPMG helps staff onto ladder
KPMG has teamed up with Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks to help its employees get onto the London property ladder. The initiative is part of a private banking package for employees which will see preferential mortgage rates negotiated by the company. KPMG's Simon Collins said: "Owning a home is fast becoming a fairytale for all but society's wealthiest. We are working hard to raise the issue with policy makers and clients but we also want to make a tangible difference to our staff who also face this problem."
Financial Times, Page: 1<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2ac2d2c-43c1-11e4-baa7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3EApwCDv5>

Former Leeds MD maintains innocence
Former Leeds Utd managing director David Haigh says an examination by PwC disproves accusations he stole around £4m from Dubai-based ex-owners GFH Capital. He stated: "PwC's conclusions, which I have now received are unequivocal. They say the Haider report on which the GFH allegations are based provides no evidence that I either created false invoices or diverted GFH money into accounts controlled by me."

SMEs

Cable admits defeat over SME lending
Vince Cable has admitted that attempts by the government to force major banks to lend more to SMEs have failed. At an event to promote the British Business Bank, the business secretary said that using big institutions as a lever didn't work and the government's view is now "let them do what they want to do, and start something new". He added: "Five years after the crisis, we still have more money being taken out (of SME lending), by Royal Bank of Scotland in particular, than being put in by Lloyds, Santander and some of the new challenger banks."

Mid-sized firms are undervalued
A report by BDO has found that medium-sized companies are being squeezed between smaller firms and major corporates. BDO said the firms are undervalued and overlooked, even though they account for more than one-fifth of private sector employment and generate £66bn of revenues. The accountant said the firms were being caught in a "policy and profile black hole", explaining that mid-sized firms were too large to benefit from policies tailored to small businesses, but too small to win the attention that the largest corporates and FTSE companies commanded from the media and policy-makers. BDO's report suggests that reducing employment taxes on mid-sized manufacturers would allow them to create 90,000 jobs.

Energy solutions for SMEs
The Guardian presents the results of a recent roundtable discussion about how SMEs can be more energy efficient. According to the Business Energy Index, 53% of small businesses in the UK have no methods in place to manage energy efficiency.

ECONOMY

Businesses must avoid risks
Minouche Shafik, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has warned that businesses must increase productivity, investment and exports to ensure a lasting economic recovery. In an interview with the Yorkshire Post, she comments: "The recovery is encouraging. The real question is how can we make this recovery sustainable. We don't want to take risks with this recovery. It's been a long recession and I think that's going to be the biggest challenge going forward." On the subject of interest rates, Ms Shafik said she would be monitoring the relationship between wage growth and productivity. She said: "If wage increases are expected but productivity is performing well we can wait for longer; if those wage increases are not accompanied by productivity increases then I think we will have to move more quickly on rates because inflationary pressures will build up."
Yorkshire Post, Business, Page: 1

Migration targets hold back UK
Alistair Cox, the chief executive of Hays, has warned that the strength of Britain's economic recovery and development of major infrastructure projects are being threatened because politicians are afraid to speak out on immigration. Mr Cox called on the Government to abandon its net migration target, claiming that it exacerbates skills shortages in the UK. He explained that the companies he deals with are experiencing problems finding people to fill skilled roles in engineering, manufacturing, energy, construction and IT.
