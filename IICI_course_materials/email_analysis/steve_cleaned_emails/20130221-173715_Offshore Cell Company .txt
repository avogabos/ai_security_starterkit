Offshore Cell Company 

 

A cell company is a corporate entity which is often used for either
collective, closed or offshore investment as it enables individual cells to
be created within a single structure and the assets in each cell to be
managed independently. 

 

How this would work in you example would be by incorporating a group Cell
Company in an offshore jurisdiction such as Seychelles, and creating a cell
for each of your customers to deposit their funds. Each individual cell then
trades only with the funds in their cells and will collect dividends or
revenues only from those in the cell. This also means you can set different
trading rules for each cell dependent upon the customer deposit, account
history and any security they provide. Each cell we would setup up within
the structure as a company with its own company number and company name
which for simple purposes would be the client account number with the client
as the manager and beneficiary of that cell. 

 

For the client this provides very good advantages as it is their offshore
company (cell) that trades via the offshore group Cell Company, and not them
personally trading with the group Cell company. Because both entities are
offshore, there is no regulation requirements and tax issues are reduced.
Only the Group Cell company requires a bank account, and each individual
cell will deposit via a unique checking account reference within one bank
account. 

 

The cell administration can be integrated with the trading platform to
automate funds administration and when a new client registers for a trading
account, a cell can be automatically generated and their money immediately
assigned to the new cell.

 

This option could be ready to trade within 3 months.

 

Incorporating the Group Cell: £75,000 (this includes government fees,
documentation fees, 50 individual cells with unique account numbers and the
business plan/ documentation that is required to form the Group)

Offshore Bank Account for Group Cell: £5,000

Our consultancy fee: £12,500

Legal Fees/ extras: £7,500 (we will return any funds unused)

 

For each set of addition cells: £5,000 per 100.
