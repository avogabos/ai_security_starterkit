Dear Steve

I sent the below email to support on Monday but as yet I have receives no
response.

Would you be kind enough to investigate this matter further as not
receiving the mail expected from Companies House is becoming a serious
problem for the company.

Many thanks

Elaine.

Thank you for the three items of commercial mail received today. It is very
disappointing to see that the first of these mails was dated January 2014,
the second July 14th 2014 and the third January 2015.

However, company mail is still missing.  Since incorporation the company
should have received mail from Companies House and HMRC.  This is statutory
mail sent to the registered office of a company after incorporation.  Apart
from this I have requested information to be sent to me from Companies
House on two recent occasions, February 27th and March 17th.  On both
occasions I have received acknowledgement of my request by email from
Companies House and have been informed that the information would be sent
to the registered office within five working days.  This information is of
extreme importance to the company and I ask you again what is happening to
this company's mail.

Companies House are an extremely efficient body and I do not believe that
mail from them for this company has not been received by your office.
Please check again with your mail room for the mail sent from Companies
House within the past days.

Thank you.

Elaine.
