Dear Dr. Sir. Siddhartha Das Gupta and Bruno Machado

 

Please
note that as per law and rules set by UK government, company director/s are
personally responsible for ensuring that they submit company information on
time. You can verify this statement on this guidance booklet link from
Companies House (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447157/GP2_Life_of_a_Company_Part_1_v4_5.pdf)

 

We
have thousands of customers and just like any other company for years we are
using automated system to send reminder emails for annual filings to our
clients on their authorize contact email address and to maintain client’s
security, automated emails are sent to 1 email address per account. Automated
system starts sending renewal reminders 3 months before the filing dates and
for some reason if client miss those emails, we cannot be held responsible.

 

We
cannot submit Annual Returns or Annual Accounts without the consent of company
director because to file annual returns company director has to verify company
information that is submitted on Annual Returns, therefore we provide Online
Company Administrator service so that company director can login to his account
and access the service to view, change and submit information to Companies
House. For Annual Accounts and Tax Returns first client has to confirm whether
company is trading or not, then have make payment for the service required. In
case of trading company client is required to submit company’s financial
transactions to us so that we can prepare and file annual accounts and tax
returns.

 

For the
filing dates, I did mentioned in my first email on date 11-Sept-2015 that
Annual Returns are OVERDUE since 04-Feb-2015. Then in my second email to you on
same date 11-Sept-2015 I clearly mentioned that If company fails to file Annual
Returns by the due date then as per law company registrar has the power to put
status for ‘proposal to strike off’ and it stays on till 6 months and then
eventually company is dissolved and FORTUNE VENTURES WORLDWIDE LIMITED was 7
months late in filing.

 

The annual
filing date is the anniversary date of company formation and from anniversary date
you have extra 25 days period to file annual returns without being penalized
our company being marked as proposal to strike off. For Annual Accounts filing
you have 9 months of extra period after the anniversary date of company
formation.

 

For services
that you paid for in 2013 such as accounting, annual returns etc all these
services were used for filings done in 2014. Now the payment that you made this
year, some of it is consumed because Registered Address, Shareholder Service
Address, Directors Protection Service and Company Protection Service were
active with Companies House without renewal since January 2015 till Sept 2015.

 

For other
services such as Dormant Company Accounts Filing, Annual Filing Fee we can
refund. For Virtual Office service we need to check and calculate days service
was used during expiry and then we can confirm how much amount will be left.

 

And now
regarding contacting Mr. Bruno, please see the attach file. The information on
the file is the authorize contact information given to us by you for company
FORTUNE VENTURES WORLDWIDE and as per rules we have to follow the information
that client has given to us through his online account at our website. Using
any other information for contacting client outside this scope and if something
goes wrong with the company we are responsible. Therefore we are not allowed to
use any other contact details but I still sent you emails for your company on 3
different email accounts.

 

We and
other service providing companies have defined process for service usage,
reminders etc and as per these processes, automated systems are designed and
impossible to customize for each individual when you have thousands of
customers.

 

I hope
above statements will give you a clear idea that we have provided you the
services. We have also contacted Companies House to provide us the quote to
restore the company. Meanwhile please advice how you wish to proceed.

 

Regards

 

Steve

Dear Mr. Steve,

 

Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta !!!

 

Thanks for the reply but honestly Mr. Steve the reply you gave is
humiliating and totally unprofessional.

To come
back to the topic let me tell you the facts.

 

I leave
aside the fact of my illness etc.

 

You guys
were responsible for maintaining the company in Good standing. From the very
first day of our association whatever you all said we did and paid you what was
billed by you. 

 

You guys
knew very well that the company for some reasons did not start up.

 

Your
first mail regarding the annual returns came to me on 11.09.2015. The mail came
to me in the registered email of the company. There you write that inspite of
several reminders we have not responded to your mail. Mr. Steve that is the
first mail sent to us from your company side, how could you write there that
" Inspite of the several reminders " ????.

Taking
for granted that you could not contact me. But what about our Director from
London Mr. Bruno Machado ? Did you even tried to call him once for the matter ?
I don't think that would have required a lot of money to call someone locally
in London city ? 

 

In your
first mail you even did not write the last date of submission of delayed
Returns . Yes the Company House can go by their norms , but I am sure that
there is a time frame within which you are given a chance to file your returns
in a later date.

Have you
ever mentioned the date to us ??

 

I
Managed the fund as stated by you as early as I could and you got it I your
account on 24th or 25 th of Sept 2015.

 

You were
very confident in letting us know that the renewal of the virtual office will
be done in no time and the accounts would also be filed within 2 days. There
was no intimations from your company end  regarding the deadly urgency of
the matter.

 

Your
Accounts centre which is a part of your company should at least be aware of the
rules and facts. We see no liason between your internal departments. For your
information ---the same thing happened when we started with you. We were told
that your company would help us to open our Bank account. After giving all the
documents and evidences and being referred by your office to RBS, Hey Market
Branch our account did not open for reasons still unknown to us. But later we
opened the account in HSBC in no time.

 

Where
question of professional activities are required we have seen unwanted
negligence and incapability from your company end.

 

As you
could not process the Annual filings as the company was already dissolved what
part of the amount paid to you is still lying with your company kindly do let
us know.

 

I have
requested Mr. Bruno to talk to you in this regards. Kindly do the needful and
oblige.

 






With sincere compliments & best
wishes....
