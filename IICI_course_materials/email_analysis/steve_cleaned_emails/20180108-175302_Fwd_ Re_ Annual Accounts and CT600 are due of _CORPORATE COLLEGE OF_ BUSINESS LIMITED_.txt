Dear Accounts Team, 

Thank you for you letter and reminder.  

For the accounting period ends on 30/04/2017 the Dormant Company
Accounts must be filed  (company CORPORATE COLLEGE OF BUSINESS LIMITED).
Please let me  know how can I pay for this service? 

During the passed year HMRC penalized me two times for non providing of
the accounts, but according to your information the accounts were
submitted. 

I sent a letter to them explaining that the company was dormant and then
called HMRC and they told me that the accounts were not correct, so I
should contact my accountant. They didn't tell me what was the mistake. 

Could you please clarify this issue. I do not understand what was
happened with the accounts submitted for the earlier periods. 

regards, 

Dmitry Ryzhov
