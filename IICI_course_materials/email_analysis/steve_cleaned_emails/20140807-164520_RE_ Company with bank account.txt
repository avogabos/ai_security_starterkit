Dear Steve

Thanks for the information.

In regards to the offshore banking options: none of the directors are US citizens or residents, but are there any limitations for paying or receiving funds from the US? We do it rarely.

Do you mean that the Latvian bank requires a director that lives in Europe?

Do all these offshore bank accounts allow for international SWIFT banking online?

Does the Delaware LLC + bank account option from restrict me for paying and receiving payments in the US? Do you offer this option?

What other banks globally will open a bank account for us without requiring residency or a visit to the branch and have no restrictions on the geography of transactions (receiving + making payments) especially in regards to the US?

Regards
David

Dear Steve Smith

Thanks for your reply.

We are not yet registered in the UK. We need a limited company
registration and bank account in the UK. Your website offers a value
starter pack for a UK company + bank account for Â£595? Is there any
guarantee of success in opening an account? I know this is not as easy
as it once was due to recent changes in regulations/legislation.

I look forward to your reply.

Regards
David
