Dear Customer,

 

Thank you for your interest in our services.

 

We can certainly offer you a very attractive package for opening and
operating a University in Gambia

Following steps are involved in registering a University:

-UNIVERSITY Name Company Registration GBC1 -      1000USD

-Apply for the PROVISIONAL EDUCATION LICENSE - 12500USD

-Apply for the COMPLETION EDUCATION LICENSE - 15000USD

 

- With provisional license you can start the online university issue
certificates or degree, but they are not accredited by other University or
the Government
- With completion your online University degree will be accredited by other
institutions as well.

I explain this to you in detail

Education License
Any education provider wishing to provide degree level or professional
course accreditations must obtain an education licence for the
certifications to be validated and stamped.

What is an Education Licence?
An education licence is a government issued authorization to an education
provider that they may issue degree level and equivalent accreditations and
certificates to their students following the completion of relevant
coursework and examinations. Many international employers and further
education providers will only accept a certification as authentic if it has
been accredited by an authorized education provider.

Solution Structure
The education licence authorizes the company to issue accreditations in most
fields of study subject to the quality and relevancy of the teaching
materials, course content, examinations and award process. The areas of
study that may be accredited under the education licence include

. Business and Marketing
. Information Technology
. Software Development
. Media Studies
. Digital Media

As part of the licence application the company will be issued with

. Company Incorporation of Limited by Guarantee company with Education
related Name
. Registered Address
. Hosting
. Education Licence
. Ongoing Monitoring in 1st year

Provisional license will be offered immediately (7 - 10 working days) after
making the first payment.  

To apply for the completion licence, the company must provide all course
materials and examinations with marking structure to the licencing board for
review. 

The website and student portals will also be assessed for suitability.

Upon review, an assessment will be made as to whether the courses provided
and examinations sufficiently deliver the requirements for the course
accreditation. 

If it is not considered sufficient, a report will be issued to the company 
for guidelines on improvements. A re-submission of the course data is
allowed within 6 months of the report date, otherwise a new application will
be required.

If the course materials, exams and marking structures are deemed acceptable,
the company will be given the Education Licence and the company may then
issue government stamped certificates to its students.

The education provider will be monitored by the licensing body for up to 1
year to ensure course delivery remains at a high level.

Requirements

. The company must have at least one Director (may be a corporate entity)
. Must hold the registered address in the jurisdiction of the licencing
authority
. Must submit all course materials, online learning, exam and marking
information
. Must permit the licensing body regular checks on the student exams and
certifications

 

 


Documents Required for Company Formation

-Passport Copy

-Proof of address (i.e. any letter from bank containing the name & address
or a copy of your bank statement or a utility bill i.e. Water, Gas or
Electric supply issued within the last 3 months

 

 

If you need any help, do not hesitate to contact me, Monday to Friday, from
noon till 5PM.

 

Best Regards,

 

Delphine Perrier
