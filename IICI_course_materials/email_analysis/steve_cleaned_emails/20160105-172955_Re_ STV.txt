Hi Steve

The attached is my daughters latest bank statement, November 2015.

We can get this certified no problem but can you advise can this be an
emailed scanned version certified as attached or does it need to be on the
original?

She is travelling at the moment in the States and will be over here in the
Uk next week where she can also get it done. Question is does the original
need to be sent over from Malaysia by mail for her to get done or can this
version be certfied?
Best regards

Phil
