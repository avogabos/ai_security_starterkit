Thank
you for your reply Steve.
I will
phone you to better understand the fees because Delphine informed me that
the cost to form a BVI corp. is 500 GBP. We were also told that the registered
and trading address will remain off public record in any event so I will phone
you to please explain what the Hong Kong Compliance package is in further
detail. With these additional charges that we were not made aware of,
 the fees may not be that competitive in comparison to other
firms we have interviewed.
Please 
confirm that the annual fees to maintain the companies and registered addresses
will be 400 GBP for BVI and 300 GBP for Belize per annum inclusive of all that
is required to maintain the entities in good standing.
Per
your request please find the following (additional) documents:
1)
Bank Statement of Director Avrohom A. Faskowitz confirming his address (he will
be the designated Director of both entities the BVI and Belize).
2)
Passport of Director Avrohom A. Faskowitz
3)
The complete Trust document of The BG Family Trust and of The GM Family Trust
who will each own 50% of The Baxton Group, the BVI entity to be formed by your
firm (please be informed that these trusts are being formed for the sole
purposes of owning The Baxton Group and will therefore be executed on the same
date as The Baxton Group is formed. )
4)
The legal owners of the afore-mentioned trusts are the Trustees  of said
trusts. I have attached the passports and proof of addresses of the 2 Trustees
Messrs. David  Grossman and Gershon Kayman. The trustees are the same for
both trusts. The beneficiaries of the trusts as in most trusts are not the
legal owners and merely consist of lineal descendants.
The
correct way of citing the trusts as the shareholders of the BVI entity
will be as follows:
"David
Grossman and Gershon Kayman as Trustees of The BG Family Trust, as to 50%
of the shares and David  Grossman and Gershon Kayman as Trustees of
The GM Family Trust, as to 50% of the shares"
5)
Tortola Holdings, LLC, the Belize entity to be formed will be a single member
entity owner by The Baxter Group - BVI and Avrohm A. Faskowitz shall be the

Please
