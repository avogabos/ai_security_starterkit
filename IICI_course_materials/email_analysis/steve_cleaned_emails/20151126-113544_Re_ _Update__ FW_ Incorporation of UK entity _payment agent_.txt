Re: (Update): FW: Incorporation of UK entity (payment agent)
Hello Steve,
Thanks for your prompt response. By PoA I meant Proof of
Address. I asked about it because there will be corporate as a one shareholder.
I understand that I need to attach Proof of ID and Proof of Address for every
single shareholder of this entity or just for persons who own more than
particular percentage share e.g. 25%?

It is
not necessary to have corporate director. The reason I have mentioned

2 human directors and appoint 1 company as shareholder. You will be required to
provide due diligence documents as per the structure that you will set for the
company.

please explain why you are mentioning Power of Attorney ?
And if
you do not need the document to be attached with your company application then
you do not need

Re: (Update): FW: Incorporation of UK entity (payment agent)
Hello
Steve,
Is
it necessary to set corporate director or we can have just two human director?
I ask, because it takes time to collect all up-to-date proof of addresses from
all shareholders. I understand that PoA shall be no older than 3 months? Shall
I get them from every single shareholder or just from major ones? The most
convenient would be if there is no obligation to set the corporate
director.
Te
document which I asked about is required by our counterparty and as far as I
know, there is no need to add it to application. So just confirm me if in this
case I don't need custom application?
Where
I should transfer money for your service? Thanks for you support.

Hello Bartek,
Sorry I made mistake in

nominee director only, beneficial owner can ask for Power of Attorney GBP 500
from Nominee Director. Bearer of power of attorney can conduct all activities
on behalf of the company such as SIGNING AGREEMENTS ETC,
except bank account
opening.
Beneficial owner cannot open company’s bank account using the
Power of Attorney.

Hello

Before
we proceed with the registration I would like to ask if you support Irish
companies registartions? I wonder if such jurisdiction would be better for our purposes.
We would like to keep this company rather dormant and appoint just nominee
director. Although, we would like to sign one agreement with psp company.
Could you confirm if it is possible in this option or we need to use any other
services?
