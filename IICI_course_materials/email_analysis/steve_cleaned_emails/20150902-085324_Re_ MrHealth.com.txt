Thanks Steve!
Fingers crossed with BVI and whether i could even use my own UK bank account if I register there. The perception of BVI sounds better to potential investors than Belize or Gambia.
Surprised at the turnover time for trademarks!! I guess i will have to go elsewhere for that.

Sorry we do not have a bundle price or package for virtual office, offshore registration and trademark, all services are available separately.
Regarding bank account following information is for Belize bank account for an offshore Belize company.
‘The client can certainly open an account in Belize but the banks in Belize are currently dealing with a crisis in restoring their US correspondence banks.  At this point the bank account solution will not work in Belize.’
Waiting for the information on BVI bank account for BVI company.

Just to be clear, as regards trademarking my company name and logo, can I can go ahead with that with you guys and what is your pricing structure for the different classes?
Also, is there a bundle price you offer for doing virtual office, off-shore registration, and trademarking all together?
