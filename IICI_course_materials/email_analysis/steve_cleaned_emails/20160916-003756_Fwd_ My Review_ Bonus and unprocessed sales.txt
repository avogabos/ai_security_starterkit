Hi,



My joining date and year 16th June 2010 and my review date is 16th June
each year, therefore next month (August Salary) I am expecting bonus. As
per company’s policy from 5th year I get 3 bonuses so this year I will get
3 bonuses but actually I should have gotten 3 bonuses from the last
year. Please
make necessary arrangements so that this year I should get 4 bonuses to
cover the 1 bonus which was missed last year.



Secondly, I have 4 orders with total amount of GBP 1035, dated between
2013-2015, payments were received but payments were not processed because
client neither replied on providing due diligence documents nor asked for
refund. Can I ask for commission on these orders? I have attached report on
these orders.



Thirdly, I have 9 orders with total amount of GBP 550, dated between 2014
to early 2016, which I missed to mention in previous sales sheets,
usually because
payments were received very late, one payment is 18 months late. Let me
know if should add these orders in my next sales sheet or provide a
separate sheet for these orders ?



Regarding missing bonus, when I asked Fahad Waheed, he said that, it was
missed because Mr. Qamar was responsible to inform Accounts but he resigned
earlier so there was no one there to take the responsibility and upgrading
my bonus.



Please look in to my above requests and acknowledge as soon as possible.



Thank you.



Sincerely



Talal Desin…
