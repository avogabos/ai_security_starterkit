hello
this  choqued  me   ...i can t  beleive  FORMATION HOUSE   is  a scam
29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR
Hi,
It took a bit of research, but please do not conduct business with anyone offering the following address:
29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR
In this instance, we were contacted about a brokerage service (a middle man) for elite sales. The guy said he tried calling, but couldn't get through (RED FLAG -- he doesn't want a phone record).
I looked at his email address, which was a website extension. I visited the website. It was a flair of words but still vague, and no contact info listed anywhere. Only a form for YOU to fill out.
I searched the company name online. I found a lot of webpages with company references, but all were again vague and nothing solid from our industry.
I found the CEO on Twitter. A Belgian guy living in Spain 10 years and is A WEBSITE MAKER. Not anyone from our specific industry. He said "business" was thriving. That Twitter profile disappeared within the last 24 hours, but he's still on LinkedIn.
So I emailed the associate back, asking for a land line phone number and a physical address. He only gave his cell +34673872084.
The address he offered was 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR.
So then I researched the address, which is flagged online for fraud and money laundering, and associated with a long line of business names. There are way too many businesses stemming from that address location, and even the same Suite number.
What a riot, to throw so many websites on the internet. And as web developers, they have the capability to create a batch of web pages to make it appear as if their "business" has been around a while.
BOTTOM LINE -- NO MIDDLE MEN FOR ANYTHING. Notice I didn't name the business. Because by in no time they'll be operating under another business
