Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
Attached are the Annual Accounts of your company ‘FORTUNE INVESTMENT & CONSULTING LTD’ for the year ended 31st Dec’16 for your review and due approval. Once approved kindly print, sign and post the Annual Accounts of your company to Companies’ House on the address given below.
Companies House
Crown Way
Cardiff CF14 3UZ
DX 33050
Please note that the amount of your company’s shares is quite significant and therefore it cannot be e-filed i.e. you need to post the accounts manually. Also, active (not dormant) company accounts have been prepared and will be submitted likewise as there has been a change in share capital structure compared to previous year.
Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.
Regards,
Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
