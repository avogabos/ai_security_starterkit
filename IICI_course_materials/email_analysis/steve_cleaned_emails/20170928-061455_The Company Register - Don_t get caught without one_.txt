Steve... here are two+ very important dates for your company diary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear SteveKeeping you fully up to date about the Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements
of the Companies Act 2014

In this month's Ezine I'd like to draw your attention to not one but...
...two+ very important company legal administration dates in 2016.

Could I urge you to mark both of these dates in your diary now,  immediately, while
they are both fresh in your mind.

You see, both of these dates relate to an important decision that affects just about
ALL existing Irish registered private companies that are limited by shares.

* Your first date for your diary is the 31st August of this year
- which is closer than you might think.

* Your second date for your diary is three months later, on the 30th November of
 this year, and this is a deadline date which Companies Registration Office (CRO)
in Ireland has warned everyone not to overlook!

So important are these two dates in relation to your Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements of the Companies Act 2014,
that I'd added an extra calendar page below for your consideration.

My reason for including this extra call-to-action calendar page is because some 
days ago Companies Registration Office (CRO) in Ireland warned that as we get closer
to the  30th November 2016 deadline the expectation is that there will be a gigantic
upsurge in the number of applications being submitted for processing - so much so
that CRO may not be able to process all of them in time to beat the cut-off deadline
of the 30th November.

Whatever you do, don't let this happen to you or to any limited company that you
have a responsibility for... or an interest in.

With such important changes happening this year, I'd particularly like you to know
that you are very welcome to call either myself or my colleague, Sue Jesper, on 
01 664 1111 or email Sue on sue@formations.ie [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0014n3sBKmyUN8XfOBgb2KUYDlsABbzYfihj4mz1NTsc21IJ-9rCq-gv1fQ1Vjk9EghHWeqVq2OipD7crh32Q465yiLWgpmmlwhLWr-egL7NfkHkaA5ClmEHXiqs-ejRNGo8shisXh1LeWx1uWuJA50Lb2odt2XnsPV5iGqF_JC09k=&c=0Bv8odVxqwGghsspNNL5msnCHM40dvj6qUORSvQmptVx2GaHkShM_w==&ch=4_BVV0s3jc8cyMQ4VB4p9tzuy1tTnE5ULC8H0bbU9e3VB6wm36CPrA==]and we'll give you all the help and advice you need.

A brief summary of what is happening + a very useful Fact Sheet for you
With the introduction of the Companies Act 2014 on 1st June 2015, all existing private
companies limited by shares, have to decide whether they wish to be a DAC or opt
 in to being the new simplified LTD.

If no choice has been made by a company as of 30th November 2016, they will automatically
be converted to an LTD.  However, failure to take action prior to this date may 
result in a corporate form that is unsuitable for the business of your company, 
and indeed may be deemed as a breach of the Directors' duties.

In order to help you decide on the best option for your company, we have put together
a fact sheet on the conversion process, together with a snapshot of the main differences
between a DAC and an LTD.  We can also provide you with guidance and paperwork in
order to convert to your desired company type in advance of the deadlines.
Click here to view our Fact Sheet

With conversion packages to LTD from as little as ?189* + vat per company (*Discounts
for multiple companies are available)  it makes excellent economic sense for you
 to contact us to see how we can help with a cost effective and efficient solution
for all your conversion needs.

NOW
is perhaps the best time of all for you to attend to the necessary secretarial work
to convert your company.

If a company is making an application to be restored within twelve months of being
struck off or dissolved it can apply directly to the Companies Registration Office.
This will avoid the necessity of engaging a solicitor and barrister and seeking 
a hearing in the High Court.

Dear Steve
,
For many people, the term "Combined Company Register" calls to mind a dusty hard-backed book, and possibly one that has not seen the light of day since being filed away shortly after the company was incorporated (
if indeed one was ever supplied...
).
But far from being an outmoded and antiquated concept, the "Company Register" is both an important legal requirement and the repository of prima facie information on both company officers and shareholders. More importantly, failure to keep one is an indictable offence!
A while ago, we got a salient reminder of just how important the Register is when we received a phone call from a very worried Director of an apartment management company.
On foot of a complaint to the
Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement
from an apartment owner regarding the holding of AGM's and other issues (
...as part of a wider dispute
) the ODCE issued a very stern letter to the Management Company stating that they needed to inspect the company's registers, and would do so
within the following seven days!
Try as they might, the management company simply could not locate it.
However, using both the internal company records, and documents retrieved through
www.Vision-net.ie
, we were able to quickly and precisely reconstitute the Registers from the date of incorporation up to the present
.
It certainly served as a timely reminder that a Company Register is far from being a dusty relic of the past.
Indeed, we are also being called upon to up-date/re-create company registers as part of due diligence investigations in company acquisition cases.
So, it's an absolute necessity for every company to not only have one, but to ensure that it is updated and maintained on an on-going basis.
If you would like some general information on Company Registers, simply click
here
to see an excellent Factsheet, prepared by my colleague, Sue Jesper.
So whether you find yourself needing to bring an old Register up to date, or reconstitute a missing one from scratch, why not talk to my colleagues
Sue
or
Nadine
. They will be delighted to assist with your requirements.
Yours sincerely
,
SÃ©an Kavanagh
Managing Director
PS -
Did you know we can supply a blank hard-bound             Register for as little as €59 including vat and delivery!
