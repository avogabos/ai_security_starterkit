and do you offer nominee director also for already existing dormant company?

We have from time to time clients looking for that, yo we can suggest you in
those cases if you wish.

As we are formation agency from Czech rep., we have Czech names. So we
provide nominee services in here, but not in the UK you know.

Hi Oliver,

 

further to our phone talk abou nominee director, please let me explain
briefly:

 

Our client is about to buy a ltd. company with adress in London town. He
would like to invest quite big ammounts to private British education and
healthcare project.

He will buy the company from us, and the registered adress will be at Old
bond street in London, in office of our accountant, He will also take care
about accountancy and audits.

 

But why I have contacted you - client wants to make impression of local,
old-fashioned company with Brit as a nominee director. As I have learned,
you are able to provide one.

Our company (eurospolecnosti.cz) is also providing nominee services, but we
all have typically Czech names and surnames, so its useless for this
purpose.

 

So we would like to order nominee director from you, for one year for price
of 5.000,-GBP as agreed.

 

But firstly please let me know the name and contact for that gentleman. Our
client is about to go to London in 8th August and stay there for couple of
days and he would like to meet that nominee director just to get to know
each other. You sure understand - as big ammounts are involved in this kind
of business, he would like to know his director personally. We are ready to
pay in advance indeed.

 

Hope it´s not a big deal, 

 

looking forward hearing from you,

 

best regards Zdenek Valasek
