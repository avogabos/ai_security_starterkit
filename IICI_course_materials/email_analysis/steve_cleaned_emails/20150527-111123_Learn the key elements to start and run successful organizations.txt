            Hi all,
            Its Bill again, long time no see. I hope you are doing well. Smart Virtual Office is nearly 10 years old, a large part is thanks to you. I have recently been invited to speak at a forum on entrepreneurship and during the Q and A, I was asked, what was the formula for success. It ended up being over 30 minutes of me just talking away. Unfortunately, many people did not get it after that Q and A. 
            As a result of that, I created a fun and important experiental game that would help people understand how I built my companies.
            
            The game will teaches us the many problems of SME owners including: 
            
                Finding and dealing with Employees
                Business Strategy
                Financing your business
            
            The concepts in this game is universal. This will hold true in every industry, in any country. We are launching it on the 29th May 2015, together with 2 of my good friends who will teach you about financing and about the legal.
