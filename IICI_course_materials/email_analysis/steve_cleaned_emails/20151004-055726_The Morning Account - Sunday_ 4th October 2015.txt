Global firms to be hit by OECD tax move
A new international tax system developed by the OECD could raise tax on businesses by as much as 10 percentage points, according to analysts. The OECD is believed to have secured broad agreement from the tax authorities of 66 countries on profit-shifting and proposals to limit the amount of debt interest that can be offset against tax. Multinationals are expected to be force to report income and tax data on a country-by-country basis. David Brookes at BDO warned of “chaos” for global companies as countries adopt the rules at different speeds over several years. PwC’s Richard Collier says Britain could be a “net loser” from the move. However, the Treasury said: “The government was instrumental in calling for international action to tackle corporate tax avoidance and has been fully supportive of the OECD process since it began in 2013.” Meanwhile, ActionAid says the poor countries had little input into the plans which “will not end tax avoidance and will not help developing countries find a sustainable route out of poverty." The IMF estimates that developing countries lose about $200bn (£132bn) in tax avoidance.

Campaigners urge Chancellor to abolish tax on directors' dividends
A campaign to abolish tax on directors' dividends has attracted 25,000 signatories and aims to attract the support of 100,000 business leaders. Serena Humphrey, owner of Nottingham-based financial training company The F Word, launched the campaign in September. She says: “With other changes coming into effect, such as auto-enrolment, a 10% increase in the minimum wage, the 3.5% insurance premium tax increase and the imminent interest rate rises, this dividend tax is an attack too far on small businesses. Those profits have already been taxed at 2%, so this 7.5% tax means we're paying 27.5%, well above the basic rate.”

Brokers seek bank levy exemption
Securities brokers including Cenkos, Numis and Canaccord Genuity are understood to be lobbying the Treasury over the bank tax. They join the challenger banks and building societies in calling for changes as it becomes apparent the levy will spread further from the big high street banks. Small cap brokerages typically have profits which are close to the £25m threshold but fear growth will be stymied by the extra tax on profits.

Belize banks linked to Lord Ashcroft in US tax probe
Two Belize banks belonging to a company controlled by Lord Ashcroft have become part of a wider US tax probe, according to Bloomberg. Belize Bank International Ltd and Belize Bank Ltd are both controlled by Belize company called BCB Holdings Ltd, in which Lord Ashcroft is the leading shareholder. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) served a summons last month to retrieve information on US taxpayers who hold accounts at the banks. A spokesman for Lord Ashcroft said the peer currently had no “material” involvement with the banks.

Corbyn’s housing tsar linked to tax avoidance
Jeremy Corbyn’s newly appointed housing adviser, Pete Redfern, allegedly heads a company associated with tax avoidance. Redfern is chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, which the Mail claims used a Luxembourg arm to cut its tax bill. Taylor Wimpey says it dismantled the scheme in 2009 but the Mail says it kept part of the arrangement until 2012, which allowed it to continue reducing taxes in other countries. The firm insists Mr Redfern was not CEO when the scheme was set up.

FRC queries Sainsbury's over supplier income
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has written to J Sainsbury after it failed to disclose its income from its suppliers in its annual report. The FRC warned all retailers in December that they should provide investors with information on their accounting policies in the wake of last year’s Tesco scandal, caused by booking income from suppliers too early and costs too late. Sources suggested that Sainsbury’s was unwilling to disclose its full supplier income as it would reveal its charges and reliance on promotions. Duncan Swift at Moore Stephens estimates that £1 collected from suppliers is worth around £15 collected from the tills. However, a Sainsbury’s spokesman said: “We have always been comfortable with our accounting of supplier income and remain so. We have responded to the FRC to this effect.”

Strike off rogue advisers
The Sunday Telegraph’s Richard Evans issues a warning against unscrupulous financial advisers who are happy to sell “the most appalling investments, tax-avoidance dodges to their trusting customers” in return for hefty commissions. He says it is “the equivalent of your doctor giving you quack remedies as long as they pocketed a fee from the maker” and, like doctors, financial advisers who behave this way should face being struck off.

SMEs

Alternative lending set to breach £5bn
The Mail’s Vicki Owen reports on the alternative finance market, loans through which could pass the £5bn mark by November, according to lender Fleximize. Observers say the diversity of finance options available to SMEs from alternative platforms strikes a stark contrast with the high street banks which are failing to cater for small firms adequately. However, the British Business Bank is working hard behind the scenes, says Adam Tavener, founder and chairman of Clifton Asset Management, who is also behind one of the potential delivery partners of the BBB’s referrals scheme. Meanwhile, Andy Bishop at Lloyds emphasises how big banks and crowdfunders can work together with Philip Monks of Aldermore also encouraged by the referrals scheme.

Supporting the start-ups
Andrew Lynch in the Sunday Times profiles tech investor and entrepreneur Stuart Marks who helps to bring together big companies and little start-ups. His latest collaboration has been JLab, an incubator that brought together the John Lewis Partnership and five start-ups specialising in the so-called internet of things. The start-ups are mentored and receive help from Mr Marks, John Lewis executives and outside experts such as Sara Murray of Buddi. Most recently, JLab invested £100,000 in Peeple, a camera device that attaches to a front-door peephole so you can dial in from your phone to see who is - or has been - at the door.

IEA issues warning over Corbynomics
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) has said Jeremy Corbyn’s economic policies risk "repeating the mistakes of the last century" and destroying Britain's recovery. The IEA described Clause IV as "the source of great waste and inefficiency" and said losses posted by nationalised industries amounted to £22bn between 1970 and 1980 alone, or around £173bn at today's prices. Philip Booth, IEA editorial director, said: "At a time when there is increasing support for Corbynomics ... it is crucial to highlight the negative consequences that previously came about from the adoption of economic policies similar to those being championed today. Nationalisation, high taxes and generous welfare payments do not bring resources under public control for the benefit of all, but instead create a whole host of inefficiencies and perverse incentives that ultimately harm society's least well off."

North-South divide will double in 10 years
A report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) expects the economic gap between London and the North of England to rise by 94% to £110bn over the next 10 years. London is expected to grow 27% in real terms in the next decade to just under £450bn, compared with a combined growth rate of 14% across the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. The report recommended more devolution of powers to the regions, such as business rates, and more investment in infrastructure. Niall Baker, an executive at Irwin Mitchell, which commissioned the report, said the Government's plans to close the economic gap between the North and South required a "radical rethink".
