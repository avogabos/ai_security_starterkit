Hello!

We are a Web Solutions company offering our services in UK region. In order
to expand, we need an offshore company registration of United kingdom. We
need to know the following:

1. Can we register a company with UK address for mail forwarding, if we are
based in Pakistan or any other country like Canada or USA? Pakistan being
the primary region. 


2. Can we get a UK bank account and/or a UK merchant account WITHOUT
physical presence?


3. Can we get a mailing address?

4. What Director details would you require? is there any requirement of a UK
Citizen info etc?


5. How long does this process take and please recommend right fit
solution/package with breakup. 

Also allow us some options & suggestions so that we can finalize and get
back to you.


A quick reply will be highly appreciated!
