Dear Steve,

Do you have any news from Eco Bank regarding Big Crown Limited 
application? Our client is getting angry and has notified us that he may 
demand his money back as the process takes too long.

Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Andrei
Unfortunately
            there is been a
            delay by ECO Bank in opening bank accounts for GBCs.
We are engaged
            with them to
            resolve the issues and are hopeful that we will come to a
            successful conclusion
            soon.
I will keep you
            updated on the
            progress and as soon we are on board, we will start
            processing the bank Gambia
            Bank Accounts.
Thank you for
            your co-operation.
