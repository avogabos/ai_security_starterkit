From: "Charlotte Pawar" <cp@accountscentre.net>
To: "'Steve Smith \(Formations House\)'" <steve@formationshouse.com>

But does this client have an licence or regulated licence for financial
services?

Can you get a clearer description of the activity as Financial and Risk
Management Conulting

Ocbc might not be keen if they think its also a form of financial consulting
