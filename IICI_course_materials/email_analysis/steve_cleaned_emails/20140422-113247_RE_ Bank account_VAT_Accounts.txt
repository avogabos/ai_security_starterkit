Dear Chris,

 

I did not receive the email dated 4th .. have checked through outlook. Did I
reply? As nothing in sent items either.

 

Anyway, I have added the VAT registration to your account. You will need to
login and complete about 6 questions on the business and invoiced amounts.
Then we can submit it. It will also ask for the NI number of the director.
Here you should put Aleks and Anthony. 

 

You can put the date of registration as today, then when the number comes
through you can reissue any invoices from after the date of registration
with the correct VAT number.

 

You cant officially invoice with VAT until you have one, but you can
reinvoice for the VAT amount later if the date of registration entered when
applying is before the invoice date. 

 

HMRC often will come back with a few questions, but this usually happens
within 20days of application or its gets its decision within 20 days.

 

PAYE can be setup faily quickly, but I will need our accountant to check
whats needed for LLP PAYE reg.

 

Steve will come back to you will all costs for this

 

Thanks

 

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte/Steve

 

I have not had a reply regarding my email below from April 4th.

 

Can you please complete the VAT registration this week, as I need to bill a
client at the end of the week.

 

Also, let me know how soon PAYE can be set up

 

Thanks

Chris

Hi Charlotte

 

We finally have the bank account setup.

 

So can you go ahead and register us for VAT.

 

Also, I would like to talk to you about the accounting and PAYE functions.

 

We should have money coming into the company from May onwards and I would
like to be paid through PAYE from that time.

 

Please let me know what you need to proceed.

 

Thanks

Chris
