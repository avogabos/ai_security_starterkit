Dear Sir

SCOS LIGHTING LIMITED

Thank you for your e-mail dated 1 December 2014.

I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved because the statutory accounts and annual returns remained outstanding, despite a number of letters being issued, including one sent via recorded delivery.  As we do not appear to have received a response, the Registrar of Companies had no choice but to believe that this company was no longer required and therefore took action which led to the company being removed from the register.

If the directors wish to restore the company to continue as an active company on the register, they can apply for administrative restoration.  The following documents and fees are required in order to make the application:

Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website.

Accounts for the period(s) 30 June 2010, 30 June 2011, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013.

These accounts will not incur late filing penalties as they became due after this company was struck off the register.

Annual Returns (forms AR01) for 17 July 2010, 17 July 2011, 17 July 2012, 17 July 2013 and 17 July 2014. These forms must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40 per annual return and can also be downloaded from our website.

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64.

I hope this information has been of some use to you.

Yours faithfully

C E Street (Ms)
