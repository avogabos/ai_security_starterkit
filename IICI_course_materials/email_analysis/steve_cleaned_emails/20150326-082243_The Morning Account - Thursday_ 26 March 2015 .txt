PAC wants tax avoidance advisers prosecuted
The Public Accounts Committee has recommended that the next government should introduce new laws to prosecute financial advisers who help wealthy individuals and firms in aggressive tax avoidance. The cross-party group of MPs has also recommended a review of all tax reliefs by the government to simplify the system, and has suggested that the government’s own recommendations on prosecution do not go far enough. Margaret Hodge, the chair of the committee, said that PwC, EY, Deloitte, and KPMG, along with promoters of marketed avoidance schemes, are part of a tax avoidance industry making lucrative business out of designing and selling ways for their clients to avoid tax. She added: “We remain concerned that HMRC’s relationship with these large accountancy firms is too cosy, and it needs to get much tougher in challenging the advice they give to their clients.”

Cameron rules out VAT increase
David Cameron has ruled out an increase in VAT if he retains power at the general election. He made the pledge during his final Commons clash with Ed Miliband before polling day. It comes after George Osborne repeatedly declined to rule out a VAT increase when questioned by MPs on Tuesday. Mr Miliband cast doubt on the prime minister’s promise, pointing out his government had raised VAT in 2010. Labour later announced it would not put NI up after Mr Cameron challenged the party to rule out an increase. The IFS has warned the two parties could find themselves with little room for manoeuvre in the next parliament in the event of an economic downturn following the announcements.

Murphy: Bonus tax to help young Scots into work
Labour’s Jim Murphy used a speech in London to herald taxes on bankers’ bonuses and a cut in pension savings relief as keys to “redistributing” wealth “from the South to the North”. Mr Murphy recalled Boris Johnson and Dianne Abbott’s attacks on his plans to use mansion tax proceeds to pay for NHS nurses in Scotland, stating: “If the current Mayor and the wannabe Mayor want to have a pop at me this time for using money from the bonuses of some London bankers to put young Scots back into work then so be it. I won’t lose any sleep over that because it’s the right thing to do.”

Google tax could have global ramifications
The Times’ Edward Fennell argues that George Osborne’s diverted profits tax could have damaging implications. Critics have warned that by introducing the tax, the chancellor has endangered the international BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) initiative due from the OECD in December. The OECD measure will tackle tax-planning strategies that exploit mismatches and gaps between tax rules of different jurisdictions, but if other governments follow the UK’s suit with their own unilateral actions, the result could be a “recipe for chaos”, according to Richard Palmer of Ashurst.

Labour instructs local parties on minimising tax
The Telegraph reports that Labour is instructing constituency parties to "minimise" tax when buying and selling properties. Labour's Property Handbook, which is distributed to local parties, is intended to help them manage their property arrangements, and give guidance on how they should interact with the national party. The paper suggests the disclosure will be embarrassing for Ed Miliband, who has mounted a personal crusade against tax avoidance in recent months.

UK joins digital tax avoidance crackdown
The UK has joined an Australia-led initiative targeting digital companies that shift their profits to tax havens. David Gauke told MPs that the UK linked up with five other countries last August to share information. He said the international project, named E6, would feed into the administration of the new diverted profits tax.

Target taxes to improve regulation
The Evening Standard’s Anthony Hilton reflects on how financial regulation has evolved since the financial crisis. He suggests that although regulation has increased since 2007-08, there remain fundamental problems that have not been addressed. One measure which could benefit the financial system, he argues, would be to target taxes. “The tax treatment of debt is much more favourable than equity, and that should be changed,” he writes.

Sports Direct questioned over USC collapse
MPs investigating the collapse of the USC fashion chain have criticised Sports Direct for withholding payments to suppliers and landlords. The Scottish Affairs Committee - which is scrutinising Sports Direct's decision to place USC into administration with the loss of 200 jobs, before selling it to another group subsidiary - branded the retailer "a backstreet outfit".

Identity theft plagues nation
The annual Fraudscape report from Cifas has found that recorded fraud rose 25% last year compared with 2013, with identify theft comprising 41% of the total. While the average victim is a 46-year-old man, with men 1.7 times more likely to have their identities stolen than women, digitally-minded young adults were increasingly being targeted. The UK’s top fraud hotspots were located in London, Leicester, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow.

Deloitte publishes payment system crash report
A report by Deloitte has criticised the Bank of England over its handling of the day-long collapse of Real-Time Gross Settlements, its interbank payment system. The crash jeopardised billions of pounds of financial transactions, including thousands of home purchases. The report into the failure found officials had never rehearsed what would happen in the event the platform went down for any length of time and has called for a wide-scale restructuring of the central bank’s operations.

Boles: Deloitte fine should benefit community
Business Minister Nick Boles says a fine to be paid by Deloitte over the collapse of MG Rover should be used to benefit the community in Longbridge, site of the former Rover factory, and the surrounding area. Deloitte is currently appealing against the fine imposed in 2013 by the Financial Reporting Council, which ruled it had failed to manage conflicts of interest when it was auditor of the carmaker.

Research by data company Beauhurt on behalf of the Government's British Business Bank found crowdfunding deals accounted for almost a fifth of all the visible equity deals in the UK during the first half of last year.

EU uncertainty could hit SME lending
