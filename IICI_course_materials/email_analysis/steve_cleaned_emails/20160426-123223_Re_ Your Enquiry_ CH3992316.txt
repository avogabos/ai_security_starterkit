Thank you for your recent e-mail concerning the restoration of the above company.

 A form RT01 is required with an administrative fee of £100 and all outstanding documents - accounts for the period ending  30/11/2014

There are no late filing penalties as the first accounts were due for filing after the company was struck off the register.

A Bona Vacantia waiver letter which can be obtained from the treasury solicitors website-https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

Alternatively the company can apply to be restored by an order of court, all information on how to restore a company by this procedure can be found on-www.tsol.gov.uk. Please note that if the company is to be restored to trade all outstanding documents are also required to be filed.
