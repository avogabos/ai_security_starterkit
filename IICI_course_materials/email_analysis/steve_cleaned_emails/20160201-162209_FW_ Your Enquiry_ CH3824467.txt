Dear Sir 

BPO RIVER LIMITED 

Thank you for your enquiry of 28th January 2016 concerning the restoration
of the above company. 

The company was dissolved because the Annual Return for the date of 16th
June 2015 was not received by Companies House.  Despite sending notices to
the officers service address and registered office address we did not
receive a reply. 

There are two procedures for restoring companies to the register, which are:

            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are
to remain on the register) 
            - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register. 

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register
Companies House will require the following documents, - 

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. 

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter. Information regarding this can be obtained from the
B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors website -
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/39
0209/BVC_14_Form_V15__1_.pdf 

3)  Annual Return form for the year ending 16th June 2015 and £40 filing
fee. 

Please note that the Accounts for the period ending 30th June 2015 will be
due on 16th March 2016.  If the company is not restored by the 16th March
2016 then we will require these Accounts as part of the restoration
application. 

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to
follow the procedure outlined below. 

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating
details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the
register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the
Court . 

Information  regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website
- 
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/treasury-solicitor-s-department
and http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk 

If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate
a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may use the same
name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees
payable. 

Yours faithfully
