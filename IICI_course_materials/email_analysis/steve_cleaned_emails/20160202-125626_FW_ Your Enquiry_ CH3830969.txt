Our Ref: REST/8866155/CES 
Date: 2 February 2016 

Dear Sir 

DESOFT GAMING LIMITED 

Thank you for your e-mail dated 29 January 2016. 

I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved
because the annual return and accounts remained outstanding despite a number
of letters being issued to the company. 

I can also confirm that the following documents and fees are required in
order to apply for this company to be administratively restored to the
register: 

Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be
downloaded from our website. 

Accounts for the period(s) 31 January 2015. 

These accounts must be accompanied by a late filing penalty of £150. 

Annual Return(s) (form(s) AR01) for 29 January 2015. This form must be
accompanied by a filing fee of £40 and can also be downloaded from our
website. 

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain
this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1
. There will be a cost of around £64. 

You should also be aware that an annual return for 29 January 2016 is due by
26 February 2016.  If this company is not restored to the register by the
due date, then this document, along with a further £40 filing fee will also
be required in order for the company to be restored. 

I hope this information has been of some use to you. 

Yours faithfully 
C E Street (Ms)
