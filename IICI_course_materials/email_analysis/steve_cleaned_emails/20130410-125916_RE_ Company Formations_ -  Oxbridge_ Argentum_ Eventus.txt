Dear Tim

 

 

As mentioned before that change in company director and shareholder
will take some time, then we will be processing the Certificate of Good Standing
and then we will process the Apostille. So please allow 15 working days for the
processes to complete.

 

 

Sending you the documents now and then sending again the
Apostille documents, we will have to charge you double for courier.

 

 

If you wish you can download current company documents from your
online account at our website.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve
