Challenger banks push Osborne on tax
Challenger banks have reiterated to George Osborne that their ability to lend to small businesses will be disproportionately affected by a new bank tax. A group of challenger bank chief executives are writing to the chancellor to insist they want to find ways to lend more despite the 8% tax surcharge, which will be levied upon banks’ UK profits above £25m from next year. It comes after a number of challenger bank bosses met senior Treasury official Charles Roxburgh last week to air concerns over the tax, which they believe could restrict lending to small businesses by as much as £6bn over the course of this parliament. A number of profitable, UK-focused high street banks are also expected to be significantly hit by the new surcharge. A report by EY forecast that the tax would raise at least £12bn over the next five years - more than double the amount estimated by the Treasury.

Murphy on ‘The Joy of Tax’
The Guardian’s Zoe Williams interviews Richard Murphy, the accountant - and author of The Joy of Tax - whose economic philosophy is widely credited as having inspired Jeremy Corbyn’s “Corbynomics”. Mr Murphy suggests there is a significant blind spot amongst academics in his profession "I did a quick Google search," he says, "and discovered that I could get 500 courses in accountancy, and none in tax. Why is something that is so important so little researched and only taught as an adjunct to accountancy? Why aren't we researching the sociology of tax, the philosophy?"  Elsewhere, the FT notes reports that Paul Marshall, co-founder of the $22bn hedge fund Marshall Wace, has applauded Mr Corbyn's idea of "people's quantitative easing" to fund infrastructure projects.

Mayor should have NHS tax powers
Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb says the Mayor of London should have the power to tax residents to pay for a better NHS. Under his plans, most health spending would be funded from a dedicated tax highlighted on payslips - but regional leaders could raise extra to tackle local needs if they wished.

Tax change could prove problematic
The CIOT is warning MSPs that the business community and public may be unprepared for the introduction of a new Scottish rate of income tax. From April next year, the UK rate of income tax for Scottish taxpayers will be reduced by 10p, and in its place Holyrood is setting a single across-the-board levy in its place. The CIOT said an effective communications campaign was essential if there was to be a smooth transition, but raised fears that awareness remained inadequate.

AA hit by insurance premium tax rise
Shares in The AA have fallen 8.5% after half-year results revealed how the group will be hit by tax rises on insurance premiums. Under changes unveiled in July’s Budget, the tax that The AA pays on the fees it collects for roadside help for drivers will increase from 6% to 9.5% from November.

Craig McNeil, the former finance director at Keydata Investment Services, has been fined £350,000 by the FCA and banned from working in the finance industry. The punishment follows a £75m fine given to Mr McNeil's former boss Stuart Ford, who allegedly mis-sold £475m of so-called death bonds.

SMEs take insurance risks
Research by Aviva shows one in five small business owners worry they do not have the right insurance cover and fear they could struggle if they had to make a claim. The study also found up to two in five businesses have not reviewed their level of insurance in the last 12 months. In 177 cases customers were found to be underinsured to the tune of £486,000 on average.

ECONOMY

Government borrowing edges up in August
Government borrowing was higher than expected in August, rising slightly from a year earlier. Public sector net borrowing excluding banks was £12.1bn last month, which was £1.4bn higher than August 2014, the Office for National Statistics said. Analysts had expected August's borrowing figure to fall to about £9bn. However, borrowing in the first five months of the financial year was £38.4bn, which is £4.4bn below the level at the same point last year. Total debt was £1,506bn at the end of August - up £68.9bn on a year earlier. The ONS blamed the rise in borrowing during August on a fall in income tax paid during the month, with fewer of the payments that were due in July being paid late than in previous years. John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PwC, said the figures were "a bit of a cold shower for the chancellor"

UK manufacturing growth slows
The CBI’s industrial trends survey has showed that manufacturing output failed to expand in the three months to September for the first time since early 2013. The monthly total order book balance from the survey slipped to -7 in September from -1 in August. Economists had expected an unchanged reading. Expectations for output over the next three months were the weakest since October 2013. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said: “Exports are the missing link in the UK recovery at the moment, with the strong pound squeezing manufacturers' margins, even though lower commodity prices are helping to ease cost pressures.”

Brexit risk will force BoE to keep rates low
UBS has warned that interest rates could be cut to zero if the UK cannot negotiate a strong foothold outside of the EU. Economists at the bank suggested that the uncertainty generated by a potential Brexit could force the Bank of England to keep its rates low for longer. David Tinsley, an economist at UBS, said a vote to leave the EU could knock between 0.6% and 2.8% of GDP. As such, the Bank is likely to be cautious in the face of such risks, and keep its interest rates at their historic lows of 0.5% ahead of a referendum.

Disrupters pose threat to bank payments
A study from Deloitte has suggested that European banks risk losing out on €22bn of revenues to big tech groups that threaten to disrupt the retail payments sector with digital services. The market is expected to be worth €128bn to banks this year, and is forecast to reach €139bn by 2030. However, this figure is €22bn less than it would have been because of technology disruption. Deloitte said the banks face losing market share to technology companies with more efficient services. Stephen Ley, a payments expert at Deloitte, explained: “Many of the big tech companies are now able to offer customers easy access to alternative, lower-cost funding, whilst having an army of loyal customers behind them, as well as scale and strong brands.”

Google reacts to Google tax
Google has published a 60-page report, commissioned from Deloitte, which shows that it contributed £11bn to the UK economy in 2014 as a result of all the companies using its products. The Standard’s Gideon Spanier suggests the decision to commission the report was probably in response to George Osborne announcing a diverted profits tax – or ‘Google tax’ as it has been dubbed. Spanier estimates Google has been legally diverting nearly £3bn, or more than 80%, of its British revenues offshore to avoid tax.
