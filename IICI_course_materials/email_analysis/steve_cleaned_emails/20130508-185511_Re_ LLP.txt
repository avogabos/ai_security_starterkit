Dear Steve,

Could you please confirm who are the Members in  INNOVATIVE ASSOCIATES
LLP? From which jurisdictions?

And again the question about how long it will take to change the
members and to obtain a relevant confirmation under Apostille?
So, we understand that we could do it through Internet, but how it
will be possible to get Apostilled documents?

With best regards,
Alexander
