you? We file the appointment of the new director and shareholder and
termincation of existing immediately after receiving payment and requiested
due diligence documents.

the current website hosted on that domain name? no, 

 

3. Why are you selling the domain name of your main website for your
business? No this is an error, no doman is available with this company, many
readymades come with a domain, as this one does not the system automically
entered our domain and this is now updated

 

4. After making payment, how quickly can the ownership of the company be
changed to my details? If due diligence has already been received and
approved the transfer is within 1 working day

 

5. Does the company name currently have a bank account associated with it?If
not, will you be able to assist with the process of opening a bank account
with the company name? no, we are only able to sell the company and not
provide any additional services.

 

6. If I get the domain name as well as the website, will you still continue
to provide the same service on the backend, while I market the services on
the website and get clients at my own prices? NA

 

7. Do I have to visit the UK to effect the change of ownership of the
company and the bank account that comes with it? To take possession of the
company you do not need to be present however we will require a number of
enhanced due diligence checks.

 

Thanks for your response.
