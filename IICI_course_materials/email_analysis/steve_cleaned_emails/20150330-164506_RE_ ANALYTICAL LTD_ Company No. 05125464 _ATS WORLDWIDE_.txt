Hi Delphine,
 
I hope you're having a good day. I've just checked the Companies House register and it is now showing myself as company director, however this is showing appointed as todays date. Can you please have this backdated to when it should have appeared on the 25/11/14? 
 
Also it is still showing my personal address on the records, as well as WWW.BUY-THIS-COMPANY-NAME.COM under the previous office name. It is imperative that my personal address is removed as well as the above name. Can you please check this and come back to me urgently?
 
Thanks again for your assistance with this.
 
Kind regards,
 
James

Hi Delphine,

 

I have just spoken with Companies House and they have confirmed that
there is no director or secretary currently appointed for the company. They
have also said there should be no issue with updating the records
regarding the addresses.

 

I need these changes done urgently please as this is holding up my
application for the office space. Can you please advise?

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Hi Delphine,

 

Thank you for your time earlier. Just to confirm the issues that I am
having with the company are:

 

- It is not showing as having a director on Companies House.

- My personal address is showing on the record for some reason.

- The previous registered address is showing on the record as:

 

WWW.BUY-THIS-COMPANY-NAME.COM 

SUITE B, 29 HARLEY STREET
 

LONDON 

W1G 9QR

 

Where this should only be showing as:

 

SUITE B, 29 HARLEY STREET
 

LONDON 

W1G 9QR

 

Can you please advise/fix this urgently?

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Hi Delphine and Steve,

 

At the beginning of the year you helped me to finalise the purchase and set up
of the above established company. I have just had someone come
back to me stating that according to Companies House there are no
appointed directors at the moment for the company!? 

 

The other point is that the records also show my personal home address
as having been a registered office, which was stated initially as
this would not occur. Further to this the previous address shows
as being from www.buy-this-company-name.com. This should only show the 29 Harley Street
aspect not the company description. Can you please get them to amend the
records immediately to remove my home address as well as this description!?

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Thank you very much for these. So just to confirm, I need to sign them and
send them to Companies House for them to lodge? Do I need to provide any
specific instruction for them to complete this?
