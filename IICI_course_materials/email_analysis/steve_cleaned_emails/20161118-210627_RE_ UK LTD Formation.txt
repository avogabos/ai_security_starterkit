Dear Steve

Thank you for your value information.

About the LLP, that you suggest, is a good idea but is a thing to think later.

To clarify, please inform the following:


1-      The new company in the beginning is to buy some participation in others companies, to act like an Holding and the in the particular case of the purchase of the capital of a LLC formed in NY-USA, must declare anything for tax purposes or only declare when receive dividends?

2-      If we form a LLP that has no activity in UK, works only in international trade, will pay 0% of tax of profits?
I only pay in my country, if I declare or not in my country of residence for ex. Angola?

3-      For ex. in a LTD or LLP, if the company only works outside UK and outside EU also, buys in third countries and sells in third countries and the goods go directly from the supplier to the customer, with customs dispatch in the origin and in the destination, do we need also of a VAT number or we can invoice the customer without VAT?

4-      "Yes bank account necessary for VAT Registration"

In this case, must be a UK bank account or may be a EU bank account?
Best Regards

UK (LLP) Limited Liability Partnership:

UK LLP is ideal for foreign nationals looking for a tax-efficient commercial structure, whilst maintaining a corporate presence in the UK. A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a company established between at least two partners.

An LLP allows for a tax-efficient strategy as they are considered “fiscally transparent” by HMRC, so the Partnership itself is not taxed; only the profits that go directly to the partners are taxed. As the partners are taxed directly, this means:

- Non-UK residents will only pay UK tax on income that was earned in the UK, so any trade occurring offshore from the UK will only be taxed at the partner’s usual tax rate, depending on their country of residency;

The cost to register a LLP company in the UK is 500 GBP; the time required to complete the procedure is 3-4 weeks.

The two basic requirements to form a UK LLP are:

1. A registered address in the UK (i.e. England or Wales)
2. Minimum two partners required.

If you cannot provide 2nd partner for UK LLP, then you can choose Nominee Partner service for GBP 500 per annum. We will register an offshore company for you by appointing you as the director and shareholder in the offshore company and appoint the offshore company as the 2nd partner in UK LLP.
