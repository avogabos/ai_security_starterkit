Dear Mr. Smith,

 

thank you for your interest in our service.

 

Mail forwarding in Luxembourg: BPM operates a street address in Luxembourg and 5 other countries.
BPM receives letters, documents and parcels which can be forwarded at customers' request to destinations all over the world.
 
Mail and parcels received at the Germany, France and Belgium maildrops are transferred automatically to Luxembourg overnight.

In Luxembourg, BPM operates the hub and sorting centre for continental Europe.

The advantage for private and corporate customers is that mail and parcels received in 4 countries can be forwarded together, thereby saving shipping charges.

 

If the customer is a company, the company retains its administrative and registered address. The agreement signed with BPM-Lux is a maildrop, mail forwarding and/or e-office agreement which provides mailroom and post management services. BPM-Lux does not provide domiciliation services.
BPM-Lux will not act as a domiciliary agent.
Customers may not use a BPM Maildrop address to set up a company or residence in any country.

 

The freight rates quoted on our Shipping Calculator include export formalities and all door-to-door shipping costs. The carriers offered by BPM will process customs clearance at the destination country before final delivery. Any customs duties, taxes or import fees incurred which are not included - this may vary from country to country - will be collected at the door or before delivery.

 

Base fees

We offer a range of services and you can familiarise yourself with them in our easy-to-follow  <https://www.bpm-lux.com/en/tour.html> Tour.
Simply decide for yourself which of them you wish to use in addition to your basic rate, and thus determine how much you pay as a base fee. 

It starts at just €5 a month with our basic rate. 

All other services can be optionally added – even once you’ve registered, this can be done simply and conveniently using your virtual mailbox, without any processing fees!
This allows you to stay flexible and tailor your chosen services to meet your needs at any time.

As-You-Go

As-You-Go fees apply when you use BPM services that are not covered in the base fee, and they are paid using an internal credit account. You can purchase BPM credits in advance and save money by opting for one of our BPM credit packages. You can find a list of these on the  <https://www.bpm-lux.com/en/pricing-register.html> Registration site.
If you don’t wish to purchase any BPM credits in advance, any As-You-Go fees owed will be conveniently invoiced together with your base fee at least once a month. 

Handling and transfers 

Handling fees apply when your item is received at one of our Maildrops. Here, we record the parcel’s dimensions and weight, as well as the sender. This information is then automatically made available to you in your virtual mailbox. 

We class a transfer as the automatic transport from one BPM Maildrop to another. This currently applies to items arriving in Germany, Belgium and France, with deliveries automatically transferred to our main distribution centre in Luxembourg. 

The following table gives you an overview of which services result in As-You-Go fees.
