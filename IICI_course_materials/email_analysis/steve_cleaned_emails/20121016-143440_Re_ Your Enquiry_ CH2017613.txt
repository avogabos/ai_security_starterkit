Dear Sir,

Company: Global Wesley Limited
Company number: 06758209

Thank you for your email

Please note, the above company is not eligible for administrative restoration as the director applied for its voluntary strike off. It can only be restored by an Order of Court.

Information regarding this process can be obtained from the Treasury Solicitors website- www.tsol.gov.uk , or from our website: www.companieshouse.gov.uk<http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/>.

If the company is being restored to continue to trade, the Registrar  will require the following documents and filing fees as part of the application:

Annual Return for the year ending 25th July 2012 with its £40 filing fee

Accounts for the period ending 30th November 2011

I can confirm that a late filing penalty of £150 will be levied for the Accounts for the period ending 30th November 2011.

The average costs for restoration by Court Order is £1500 to £2000 and the process takes between 6-8 weeks.

If there are no assets tied up in the company, the director may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, he may use the same name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

Information on restoration by Court Order can be obtained from the Treasury Solicitors website- www.tsol.gov.uk , or from our website: www.companieshouse.gov.uk<http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/>.

If you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully,

Maxine Hartrey
