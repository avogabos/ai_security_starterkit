Dear Steve,
I have just updated the information following your guidelines - I have terminated the Secretary appointment of Svetoslav and appointed him as Director only. Could you please check if I have done this correctly? If yes, I have to now wait for 24 hours before I can submit the Dormant Company accounts, correct?
Thank you so much for your help!
Kind Regards,
Irene
