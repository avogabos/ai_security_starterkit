Hi Steve


We would still like your company to prepare the accounts for the LLP


I sent an email about this asking a couple of questions about how to complete the accounts template.


Can you see if you or your team have replied to this as I have not received anything.


Thanks

Chris

To use the full service for PAYE in which we will prepare the payslips and file returns etc, the service will cost GBP 1500 per annum if employees are 3 or less than 3. Using the service, at month end you will need to provide information on amount of salary paid each month to each employee, so that we can prepare payslips and file returns.



Please note that this service is not advertise on our website, because we provide this service to very specific customers.

Hi



Thank you, but do you mean you will be filing them as well or is this something I have to do.



You say 'contact HMRC as informed' - what am a supposed to say.



Can you confirm that you will be acting as a full PAYE service or not.
