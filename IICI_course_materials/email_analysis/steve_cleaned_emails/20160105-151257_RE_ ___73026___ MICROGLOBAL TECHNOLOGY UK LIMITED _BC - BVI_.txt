Your client confirmed to the email dated 17th December 2015 (please see below) that the client was happy to just have Yan Cui as the sole signatory.

 

 

Please amend the Bank Contract with Yan Cui signing solely, and leave Chuntao in the UBO information box, page 5.

Dear Nadya,

 

The compliance has reviewed the documents and wrote:

 

Both Chuntao Liang and Yan Chi signed the Bank Contract, however on the Corporate Resolution only Yan Chi was authorized to operate the account.

Can you please confirm if both of the clients are going to operate the account? If that's the case, please amend the Corporate Resolution content with both clients name.

 

Thank you.
