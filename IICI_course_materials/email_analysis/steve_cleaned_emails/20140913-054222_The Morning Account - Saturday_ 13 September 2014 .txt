Tax changes afoot regardless of Scots vote
The FT’s Adam Palin examines the changes ahead for Scotland’s tax regime, whether the electorate votes for independence or not. The Scottish government already has powers over stamp duty land tax, which will be replaced by the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in April 2015, council tax rates and has limited control over income tax rates. From 2016, it will be able to vary the rate paid by Scottish resident taxpayers by up to 10 pence in the pound. “We are going to see action on income tax whether or not Scotland becomes independent,” says George Bull, senior tax partner at Baker Tilly. Devo-max could see Scotland win full control over income, inheritance and capital gains taxes while independence would mean the Scottish parliament would assume formal legal responsibility for all taxes with any changes resting partly on the success of the SNP’s policy to cut corporation tax and oil revenues. Ronnie Ludwig, a partner at Saffery Champness commented: “It is all very much in the melting pot.” Additionally, Scots south of the border could register as non-domiciled in the UK.

Martin: Flouting rules creates advantage for some
JD Wetherspoon chief Tim Martin says his firm paid £600m tax on £1.4bn of sales in the past year, with £157m of that in alcohol duty and £275m on VAT. Mr Martin says that “pubs are taxed excessively and the Government would create more jobs and receive higher levels of overall revenue if it were to create tax equality among supermarkets, pubs and restaurants." He also hit out at institutional investors who push for companies to adhere to the rulebook on good governance. Mr Martin said pub firms which ignore good practice and appoint their top executives to chairman fare better than those that comply with the rules. “Compliant companies, with a so-called independent non-executive chairman and dominated by non-executive directors, often with a very small number of executive directors, tended to be excessively influenced by City fashions, creating instability and poor performance as a result,” he said.

HMRC plans to issue 2,500 APNs per month
The FT’s Adam Palin reports that HMRC began sending out accelerated payment notices to investors in alleged tax avoidance schemes at the end of August but was unable to comment on which schemes' users they had been issued to. HMRC said it was “building up to issuing about 2,500 notices per month by the end of the year.” Tessa Lorimer, special counsel at Withers commented: “Some people will pay up, some will drag their feet, and some people will go bankrupt. A lot of people have invested in these schemes not to avoid tax, but to assist their cash flow [by offsetting tax liabilities].”

Business rates regime has "become a nonsense"
The CEO of Paperchase, Timothy Melgund, has criticised the business rates regime describing it as “a nonsense”. Local property taxes, based on valuations set near the height of the market in 2008, is overdue for a complete overhaul, he says. "In some of our shops, the rates are higher than the rent. That's absolutely batty.”

Boris would charge motorists by the mile
Boris Johnson has proposed axing road tax and fuel duty and replacing them with pay-as-you-drive charges. Paying an increased charge per mile during busy periods would also reduce congestion and pollution, he says. Mr Johnson conceded that his proposal would win support only if it did not increase tax revenue and was accompanied by the end of road tax and fuel duty.

Bring Chapter 11 to the UK
Chris Blackhurst reviews his week noting that he met with fashion retailer Harold Tillman and Lord Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer. Both men had businesses put into administration and are now advocates of a UK equivalent of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules found in the U.S., saying UK pre-pack deals deserve their bad reputation.

Tianhe accused of fraud by Anonymous
Chinese company Tianhe has been accused of being a “massive fraud” by Anonymous Analytics. The report by AA into the coatings specialist said: “We have conducted months of due diligence, field research and analysis which show that Tianhe is a massive fraud and one of the largest stock market scams ever conceived.” AA claimed that Tianhe had generated a fraction of the sales and profits it reported in the prospectus. Tianhe requested its shares were suspended after they slid 5% following the publication of the report. In a statement Tianhe said it reserved the right to “take legal action for damages or other relief”.

Lagarde: Put women in the driving seat
IMF chief executive Christine Lagarde has said companies and countries are failing to utilise women’s skills and that the global economy will only improve if women are allowed to take a greater role in the workplace. Ms Lagarde told the World Assembly for Women conference in Tokyo: "Women are the ultimate agents of aggregate demand, accounting for 70% of global consumer spending. So if we want growth, let us put women in the driver's seat," she said.

Daily meditation becoming mainstream
Virginia Matthews explores the increased use of meditation to improve performance as mindfulness exercises are becoming more mainstream with both schools and employers. Advocates say that training the brain to focus firmly on the present moment not only improves exam performance but also significantly boosts overall well–being and happiness. PwC is one such convert, as Sarah Churchman, head of diversity and inclusion and employee well–being, explains: "As in many large and complex organisations, the biggest cause of absenteeism here is related to stress or depression. We have introduced a holistic mental health and physical approach, including mindfulness training, to help combat this."

Smart allocation could improve Isa returns
Richard Evans explores ways leaving shares outside of an Isa could be more beneficial than putting them in one in the Telegraph. Basic rate taxpayers, for example, cannot shelter their share dividend gains in an Isa as they are taxed at source. Leaving them outside would leave room for bonds or bond funds, the interest on which is not taxed at source and so can remain untaxed in an Isa.

Net flows out of Britain hit £16.8bn amid independence fears
Investors took nearly £17bn out of the UK in August at the highest pace since 2008, according to CrossBorder Capital. The data came as a number of the world’s leading investment banks including Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan ratcheted up their warnings of the potential consequences of Scotland breaking away. A study by Deutsche Bank said a Yes vote for Scottish independence would "go down in history as a political and economic mistake" that would risk a depression for Scotland. Gordon Brown said the Deutsche Bank report showed that Scotland was "in danger of falling through an economic trapdoor".

Construction growth flat in July
The Office for National Statistics has revealed that the UK’s construction sector did not grow during July, following a 1.2% rebound in June. The flat growth was caused by a 4.1% fall in non-housing repair and maintenance, which dragged down improving infrastructure, commercial and housing work. As a result, the annual rate of growth fell to 2.6%, the weakest performance since November last year. Despite this, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts “decent expansion in the third quarter, and contribution to GDP growth”.
