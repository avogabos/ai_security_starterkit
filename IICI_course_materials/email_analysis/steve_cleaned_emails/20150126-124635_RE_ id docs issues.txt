Dear Chris

 

We have looked at the other order mentioned and the ID docs have been
requested now.

Although we appreciate the exact rules state ID isnt required, we try to
follow a standard rule of thumb whereby it is requested in all cases.

 

In this case we will accept your certification and that you will maintain
the required Due Diligence documents. 

 

May we also add that during any planned trips to London, please make some
time to come in see us at our offices in Harley Street so that we may
formally meet

 

thanks

Charlotte,

 

Attached is the document that Mr. Holland has provided, Would this work for
the transfer of the company.

 

Felix.

 

Dear Felix,

 

I am very sorry that we got off on the wrong foot. I have recommended
numerous clients to you and what still puzzles me is that you dont ask for
identity from everyone purchasing an off the shelf company. It seems a
completely random process. Out of the two clients that I recommended to you
this week, Mr Alan Lawson purchasing Bond Street Investments Limited was
asked to provide copies of passports and utility bills whereas Mr Adrian
Jones purchased Business Corp Limited on the same day and wasnt asked for
anything.  

 

I talked to my contact at HMRC this afternoon and he confirmed to me that
the full due diligence test for transferring the share capital of an
existing aged company is still not NOT a regulated function unless the price
was for a large consideration. When I asked him what large constituted,
he told me that £15,000 and above was their definition of large. 

 

Weve had site of all my clients IDs and we have performed full KYC due
diligence. I can personally vouch for Mr Alan Lawsons and Mr Adrian Jones
bona fides.  Please find attached my own MLR certificate. I act exclusively
on behalf of ultra-HNW individuals and I do apologise for my attitude in my
last email to you. Im sure that youre aware that when dealing with
extremely wealthy people, especially those born into money they demand
everything immediately rather like spoiled babies. Sometimes the pressure
rubs off on me and for this I apologise. 

 

Best regards,

                                                                     

Chris Holland

Dear Mr Holland,

 

It is a requirement of UK formation agents and those registered with HMRC
under MLR to maintain due diligence records of the directors we appoint to
any company whether new or existing. We do not require the original
documents or notarised documents for UK companies, but do require scanned
copies. We are unable to tranfer any company to you or your client without
any such documents. Please see the following link
http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/mlr/your-role/resposibilities.htm 

 

We are somewhat surprised at your attitude as you appear to be operating as
a trust agent or reseller and therefore under the same obligations as we
are. If you are registered under MLR then we can take a copy of your
certificate and we would then not require the directors id, if you confirm
in writing (via email is acceptable) you have undertaken the necessary due
diligence. 

 

We value your custom and we understand the diligence requirements can be
arduous however we are subject to uk legislation, as you may also be. 

 

Please note, if you engage in any activity which we consider defamatory we
will take appropriate action including but not limited to full restitution
of any damage caused to our reputation from such activity.

Dear Felix,

 

Thank you for your reply. It is a real shame that your company has decided
to implement these unnecessary rules on such an arbitrary and random basis.
I am aware of other clients that I have recommended to your company and who
have successfully purchased off the shelf aged companies in the last few
days and have NOT been asked for any kind of ID whatsoever, as the
Government does NOT require ID for the purchase of 100% of the share capital
of existing aged companies. 

  

I have previously recommended dozens of my clients to you as you were the
cheapest and most convenient source of aged companies, however with this new
rule that you have suddenly imposed (without disclosing it on your website)
I will unfortunately now have to find another company to recommend my
clients to.  Your control panel and speed of turnaround were so impressive I
am very disappointed to have to find another company who will match up to
your previous high  level of service.   

 

My client specifically ordered this company because your website clearly
stated that, unlike new companies, NO documentation is required. 

 

With this sudden and unannounced changed of conditions, this is a clear
breach of contract on your part, so please cancel my clients order
forthwith and refund his credit card immediately. If you fail to comply not
only will we initiate an immediate chargeback, our reputation management
firm will be instructed to spend an entire month criticising your company
and posting hundreds of negative reviews.    

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Christopher Holland MBA, LLB (Hons.)
