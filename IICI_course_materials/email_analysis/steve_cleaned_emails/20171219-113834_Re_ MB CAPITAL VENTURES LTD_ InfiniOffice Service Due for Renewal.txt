Hello,

I am trying to renew my mailing address for MB CAPITAL VENTURES from the old site and it will not let me do it. I have created a new account on the new site as ell but it will not accept the company as an existing one in the system so the dashboard for services to renew is empty!

Please advise.

In addition I am still expecting a reply to the numerous e-mails I have sent you concerning the telephone and fax numbers that are not working for 5 months now.

If you can not provide the service pls let me know as I have serious problems with our a telephone! In addition I will rather need a credit note for these services and not a billing note don’t you think so?

In anticipation once gain for your reply.

Regards,

Maria Banakou
