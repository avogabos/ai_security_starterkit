Hello,
I have tried to log in on your new web site but for some reason it does not accept my password. I have requested a password reset using to the following email address: info@lovemadelove.com <mailto:info@lovemadelove.com>  on Friday, as well as today and I still do not have the reset password email. Our ID is: 87619249 
Now my account is blocked and I need to pay for our dormant account annual submission or it will be over due!
Please advice!
Thank you.
Regards,
Yanitsa
