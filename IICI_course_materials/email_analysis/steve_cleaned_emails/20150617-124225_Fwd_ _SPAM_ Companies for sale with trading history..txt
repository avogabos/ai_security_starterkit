Old UK readymade companies, we have done some in house little transactions just to file active trading accounts for them at Companies House.
Buying these kind of companies give you an assurance that these companies haven’t done any fraud and have not involved in any Bad reputation in the market
We have one company available at the moment and details are as following:
- RESOURCE CENTRAL LIMITED – 2010 – capital shows as £1000 but has continuous filed accounts - 12000 GBP
With the active trading companies we will provide “Certificate of NO outstanding liability for the trading company” - basically the letter, which states that the company has no creditors.
If you require further information or assistance, please let me know.
Best regards
