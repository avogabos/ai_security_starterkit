Dear Sarah



We refer to your email below relating to the checking of name “Invicta
Guarantee Holdings Limited” in BVI and advise that, according to BVI
Business Companies (Restricted Company Names) Notice, 2013, the word
“Guarantee” is a restricted word contained in the attached Schedule. The
Registrar shall not register a company that has a restricted word in its
name unless the Commission has given prior written consent to the use of the
word.



As such, please provide us alternative name(s) for checking in BVI.



We look forward to hearing from you soon.



Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.



Thanks and Best regards

Polly
