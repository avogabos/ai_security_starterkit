Subject: As Discussed with Athena
From: Tony Spencer <tony@holidayrentals.com>

Hi Steve,

Just spoke to Athena on Live Chat about our requirements for an on line
payment gateway.

I own a holiday rental website which is physically based in India. We
advertise holiday homes and charge a subscription from our customers.
There are no Auto Renewals or recurring charges. This is the only fee
they pay us.

Our website is http://www.HolidayRentals.Com

We were using www.2Checkout.Com for processing our payments. Our monthly
volume is around $30,000

I would say our monthly transactions are around 350.

I am looking for a reliable solution in which we can have a proper
gateway through which we can process cards from our end too. Till now,
customer has to come to our site and make the payment. I want to add a
Virtual Terminal too along with this through which we can take details
from the customer and process the card for them.

Can you help in any way.
