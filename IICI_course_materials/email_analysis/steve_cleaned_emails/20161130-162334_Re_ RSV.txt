Dear Marco,
Documents
received, forwarding it to due diligence team if the provided letter from
council/town office is acceptable or not.
The second
document from TIM seems like a telecom utility bill and as you know telecom
bills such as, phone, mobile, TV, internet etc are not acceptable,.
And for
business activity you mentioned ‘Consulting’, please provide bit more detail
about what type of consulting to what type of people or company.
