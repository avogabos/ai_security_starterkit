Dear Giuseppe,

 

Tahir has had to take some last minute leave, and is unable to answer emails.

 

Please can you give me the name of one company and I will chase it up for you

 

Thanks

Charlotte

Good Morning Tahir,

I hope you are well.

Can you please send us all invoices Massimo have to pay for all his companies?

Last month it's been very busy. Our italian LTD company became a Corporation, so we didn't have much time to overview other things. So please let us know everything we have to pay.

Other question: How to file the companies annual return? Can you directly do it? Thank you. Let es know

Best Regards
