For BVI please have the form filled by notary public and send it

Dear Angela
Again attach is the form which is to be filled by your
Notary Public Office required for BVI company formation.
For notarization documents must be stamp by public notary
in Dominican Republic. Also you need to arrange English translation of these
documents and translation document must also be notarized.
Regarding HONG KONG it is in process but on hold, I was
told by our Support Team that you have been emailed to resend copies of
passports because a single digit of passport number is missing. Please check
your email and other emails
messin@marquezsarraff.com
and
julian@marquezsarraff.com
if you received the email from
support@formationshouse.com
. Please also check the
SPAM/JUNK section and arrange passport copies as required.
And if
required you can speak to Mr. Shawn or Ms. Rachel in our support team at
+44-207-016-2728
from 9am to
5pm Monday to Friday.
