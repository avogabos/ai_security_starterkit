Hi Steve,
As we have already informed that since the goods are not physically being in UK, there will not be any implication on UK VAT.
To set payroll, we need the company name, registration number, Employer PAYE reference, Account Office Reference, number of employees (with date of birth, NI number), each employee salary and payment frequency.
To register the director for self assessment, we need directorâ€™s name, date of birth, Tax reference number, National insurance number and personal address.
Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.
Regards,
Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
