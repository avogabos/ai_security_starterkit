HMRC takes its Big Brother approach online  

The Mail’s Victoria Bischoff provides an overview of HMRC’s new digital tax account system. One million taxpayers have already being asked to set up online personal accounts with thousands to follow next year. Two million businesses already use digital tax accounts, and by April 2016 all of the UK's 5m small businesses will have access to one. Ms Bischoff points out that HMRC has put in place plans to extract data from lettings agents and firms such as Airbnb, along with auction sites such as eBay, to clamp down on those who fail to declare profits from such activities, and so avoid paying income tax or VAT. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the ACCA, says: “This is HMRC's way of taking its Big Brother approach online to crack down further on tax evaders. HMRC should be very careful it does not end up with spurious data that means they start charging people tax when they are only using websites to flog a few second-hand boots and books.”

Record profits lead to £8.1m tax bill for Starbucks

Starbucks UK has paid more than £8m in tax in the past 12 months on the back of pre-tax profits of £34.2m in the year to 27 September. Prior to 2012, the company paid just £8.6m in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK. Increased profitability and changes to the way it accounts for payments made to other parts of its global business following a public outcry have led to the increase in tax paid.

Hillier backs HMRC investigation into Sports Direct

Meg Hillier, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, has joined calls for Sports Direct to be investigated by HMRC over its pay practices. A Guardian investigation last week revealed how thousands of Sports Direct workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Ms Hillier said: "They may be, they say, sticking to the letter of the law, but certainly they are breaking the spirit of the law and certainly the spirit of being a good employer."

In support of a Fair Tax Payer label

Heads of tax, FDs and CEOs from firms such as SSE, Lush, Unity Trust Bank and Co-operative Energy write to the Guardian to emphasise the importance of tax transparency and the concept of the Fair Tax Mark. They say they look forward to the response from the EC on proposals from the European parliament on a package of tax-avoidance measures adding that they are pleased to see that the European parliament will consider the merits of establishing a Fair Tax Payer label in each member state.

Christmas shopping - Avoiding the tax avoiders

The Guardian’s Hilary Osborne considers the companies consumers might want to shop from if they find themselves ethically-minded over Christmas. In light of the tax planning by multinationals such as Mondelez, Apple and Amazon, or the approach to workers by the likes of Sports Direct, she suggests a range of alternatives, such as Blackwells or local book shops instead of Amazon; chocolate makers Divine or Montezuma rather than Cadbury’s or Green & Blacks; Lush, which boasts the Fair Tax Mark, is an alternative to Boots. The Co-op Group also qualifies for the Mark, while Waitrose has been rated the most ethical supermarket by Ethical Consumer magazine.

Pressure grows for FRC investigation into HBOS auditors

Treasury Select Committee member Steve Baker MP has said he would like to see the Financial Reporting Council appear before the committee to be asked why it decided not to pursue investigations into KPMG’s role in the collapse of HBOS. His comments follow news that the FRC made the decision not to investigate KPMG over its auditing of HBOS in 2013. Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, has this week written to Steven Hadrill, chief executive of the FRC, urging him to begin an investigation into KPMG “without delay”. During an evidence session yesterday, Mr Baker went on to say that the accounting industry should be better regulated, suggesting the loan loss provision model and mark to market were problematic. “I believe banks are as a result overstating profits and capital and are far more vulnerable as result,“ he said. Mr Tyrie asked Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and FCA non-executive director Sir Brian Pomeroy during the session, why they thought the FRC was “dragging its feet” and whether the regulator was “a loose rivet below the waterline”. Mr Bailey replied: “I think the FRC has done a lot in recent years to apply greater rigour to the standards of auditing, starting from a very low base”. Following the meeting, Mr Tyrie said: “The committee has heard some very interesting evidence over the last two days, not least on the role of bank auditing. When it comes to the FRC’s conduct with respect to KPMG’s role in the collapse of HBOS, Lewis Carroll had it right – ‘curiouser and curiouser’.”

Employer impressed by rare Bs rather than common As

Angus Knowles-Cutler, a senior London partner with Deloitte, says that as an employer he would be more interested in a candidate who secured three Bs at A-level in an institution where three Ds was the average than he would be in a student holding 3 As who attended a school where such grades were the norm. He said such a perspective comes as employers seek “people who are going to strive and perform - and perform well under their relative circumstances.”

PENSIONS  

 

Treasury confirms annuity freedoms

Five million pensioners will be able to cash in their annuities for a lump sum from April 2017 without having to pay high tax penalties, as the Treasury confirmed plans to launch a secondary market for annuities. Existing annuity holders will get the freedom to swap their incomes for cash or put the money in a fund to withdraw as they choose. However, pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann commented: "Keeping an annuity will still be the right decision for the majority of people." Tax charges will drop from between 55 and 70% to no more than 20, 40 or 45%. Douglas Anderson, partner at Hymans Robertson, said annuities have had a bad press as rates have tumbled, but: "The reality is, if you are looking for a guaranteed lifelong income then they are impossible to beat." Mike Smedley, pensions partner at KPMG, added that: "Consumers might be disappointed in what purchasers may be willing to pay. The only way in reality this works is if they [consumers] sell it for a lot lower price than the price they bought it at.”

M&A activity in 2016 to focus on SMEs

Scotland's corporate dealmakers are optimistic about the prospect of heightened M&A activity over the coming year but there continues to be a disparity in price expectation between buyers and sellers. A survey by KPMG, released yesterday, suggests that more than half of deal making professionals expect the bulk of M&A activity in 2016 to focus on SMEs.

ECONOMY  

 

UK inflation rate rises to 0.1% in November

The UK's inflation rate turned positive in November for the first time in four months, official figures show. The rate as measured by the Consumer Prices Index rose to 0.1%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Transport costs, alcohol and tobacco prices were the main contributors to the rise in the rate, however, this was partially offset by a drop in clothing prices, which for the first time fell between October and November. Analysts had expected a figure of about zero. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past 10 months, with a rate of -0.1% recorded last month. Meanwhile, pay growth could be just 1% next year if inflation rises faster than expected and productivity remains steady, according to the Resolution Foundation. Separately, an analysis of job creation figures from the ONS by the Enterprise Research Centre found a net 695,500 positions were created in the private sector in the 12 months to March 2015.

Scotland on course for £50bn debt

As John Swinney, the Scottish Finance Minister, prepares to deliver his 2016/17 Scottish Budget on Wednesday, business minister Nick Boles told the commons new figures showed Scotland’s public sector debts could reach £50bn by the end of the decade. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s wealth creation spokesman, demanded a parliamentary inquiry to investigate debt levels following a report detailing a raft of PFI expenses. A report from the Guardian found that public authorities are committed to spending £9bn on new PFI infrastructure deals in addition to £22bn in historic PFI debts, £15bn Scotland’s councils owe to banks and £4.9bn Mr Swinney has been given permission to borrow on upgrading the rail network. Mr Boles pointed to the SNP’s predictions for the Scottish economy prior to last year’s referendum which “rested upon oil prices at a $100 a barrel, which would now see an independent Scotland entirely bankrupt and probably scuttling to the IMF."

Female billionaires catching up with men

The number of female billionaires worldwide has increased nearly sevenfold over the past 20 years to 145, according to a study published by UBS and PwC. In 1995 there were only 22 female billionaires, but the club is still dominated by men over 60. There are 1,202 male billionaires - but their number has grown only by a factor of 5.2, compared with 6.6 for women. Asian entrepreneurs are driving the growth in female billionaires. The report also found respondents sensed a growing "anti-wealth sentiment" among politicians, with higher taxes and increasingly onerous financial regulations. The report stated: "Billionaire families see regulation and taxation as a key menace to maintaining their legacy."
