Dear Steve,

I was just about to call you about this case but thank you very much for
reply. Issue with this case is that the Client will need this company be
registered on next week Wednesday (Feb 15th) when this Mitaxnor LLP should
buy one quite a big Finnish company shares from the biggest restaurant
chain in Finland. The Client has been very nervous as we couldn't do our
job in time and he can't get more time from the seller. If he has to use
another company to buy these shares it will mean lots of extra work and we
will for sure loose this client.

If you can promise we will get at least the register number for this
company on next Tuesday I can promise you £500 extra (if it will help to
speed this) and we will pay this amount before you need to send any
documents to us. What you think would it be possible?

Mitaxnor llp case
Dear Steve,
We haven't heard for a while any update about this case and
the Client is calling us everyday. Could you please inform us why it takes so
much time or tell us if you can't handle this asap so we can start
incorporation process with another company.
Thank you.
