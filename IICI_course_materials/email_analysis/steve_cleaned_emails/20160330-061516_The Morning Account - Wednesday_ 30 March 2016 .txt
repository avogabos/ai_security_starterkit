Sturgeon: Raising top tax rate would cost £30m

Raising the top rate of income tax to 50p straight away would see Scotland lose up to £30m a year, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The First Minister told the BBC: "I've got analysis prepared by civil servants that says if we do that right now then, within the current devolved powers, in Scotland alone then that could see us not raise additional revenue but lose us up to £30m a year.” She added: “The reason for that is that while we have the power to set tax rates we don't have power over income tax avoidance." Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens have called for a 60p top rate of income tax, and urged the SNP to do more to match its rhetoric on social justice and inequality. The party wants the new rate to apply to those earning more than £150,000 and it also plans a new 43p rate, starting at £43,000.

NI adjustment is a tax rise by any other name

The Guardian's David Brindle examines the NI adjustment taking effect on 6 April, suggesting 5m public sector workers could be negatively affected. The change is an average increase of 15% in NI contributions for around 6m workers still in final salary, or “defined benefit” pension schemes, most of which are in the public sector. Mr Brindle notes that because the increase does not affect main NI rates, it technically allows the government to adhere to its pledge not to raise VAT, NICs or income tax. However, according to financial expert Paul Lewis, anyone in a defined benefit pension scheme who had gross annual earnings of at least £22,436 in 2015-16 will end up worse off even after a 1% pay rise and tax allowance changes.

Longworth: Multinationals escape taxes in EU

Writing in the Standard, John Longworth accuses some multinationals of taking advantage of using EU membership to hide behind rights legislation and avoid paying taxes. He adds that “many home-grown businesses which pay their taxes are naturally furious at this unfair competition,” pointing to a recent report by Civitas which suggests the EU Single Market has benefited the most from business finance guidelines, and corporations from outside Europe and Britain the least.

A curb on profit shifting is the whole point

Heather Lowe of the Financial Transparency Coalition writes to the FT to defend the BEPS process and argue that criticism by multinationals “merely signals the transition period that the financial markets should be expecting.”

Accountants recognised as social mobility champions

The Department for Business, Innovations and Skills has recognised some of the biggest accountancy firms as leading social mobility employers. Deloitte, EY, KPMG and Grant Thornton were amongst 11 organisations named. Melanie Richards, KPMG vice chairman, said: “By widening access to the profession we will attract the best talent from a wide mix of backgrounds, helping us to better advise our clients.” Grant Thornton’s chief executive Sacha Romanovitch said: “The award reflects our efforts in delivering against demanding criteria and translating words into action.” Mandy Love, partner at EY, added: “Taking part in the social mobility compact has helped us to better understand how we can improve social mobility in our own firm, take action to limit inhibitors, and share best practice with others to encourage them to do the same.”

Buy-to-let landlords face tougher borrowing standards

Landlords are facing tougher borrowing standards after the Bank of England set out new guidelines to protect the buy-to-let mortgage market. "Looking ahead heightened and prolonged uncertainty has the potential to increase the risk premia investors require on a wider range of UK assets, which could lead to a further depreciation of sterling and affect the cost and availability of financing for a broad range of UK borrowers," the BoE's Financial Planning Committee said in a statement. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) will require lenders to set a minimum borrower interest rate of 5.5% over a minimum period of five years when assessing affordability, a move expected to reduce buy-to-let approvals by between 10% and 20% over the next two to three years, the Telegraph suggests. Research by the PRA showed lenders expect 20% growth in gross buy-to-let lending over the next two to three years, including the 3% increase in stamp duty for landlords and second homeowners.

PENSIONS

 

Pension withdrawals bring tax boost 

Savers who have taken advantage of new pension freedoms are thought to have paid £900m in tax since last April, almost a third more than expected. Some 120,959 pensions were cashed in entirely over the first three months of the rules coming into effect, the Financial Conduct Authority has revealed. OBR figures show that the Treasury expects to get £900m in tax by April as a result of the new rules, compared to £700m last year.

FRC to publish HBOS findings in the Spring

The Financial Reporting Council aims to publish a full report in the coming weeks into KPMG's auditing of HBOS, before the lender collapsed in 2008. FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill said the body will conduct preliminary enquiries as quickly as possible, but that it was important the findings were robust enough to be tested by an independent tribunal: "Nonetheless we would hope to be in a position to report our conclusions in the Spring," he added, in a letter to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons' Treasury Select Committee.

Money worries biggest barrier to entrepreneurs

Research by the Start Up Loans Company indicates money worries are the biggest barrier to would-be entrepreneurs in Scotland starting their own company. The study shows 41% of Scots put financial fears at the top of their concerns, with other hurdles cited including a lack of knowledge and experience, family commitments and not knowing where to turn for business advice.

Brexit risks credit crunch, says BoE

The Bank of England has warned that a vote to leave the EU risks causing a run on sterling, a credit crunch and higher interest rates for mortgage payers and businesses. A statement from the Bank’s financial policy committee warned that “heightened and prolonged uncertainty” had the potential to drive up interest rates for a wide range of assets, “which could lead to a further depreciation of sterling and affect the cost and availability of financing for a broad range of UK borrowers”.

‘Lobo’ loans casualty list extends to housing associations

It has emerged that up to 30 UK housing associations have bought up to £1.25bn of controversial "Lobo" loans, already claimed to have cost local authorities millions of pounds while amassing large profits for the banks that sold them. Smith & Williamson partner Jonathan Pryor, a Lobo specialist, said market swings on such loans have left housing associations out of the money by up to 50% because of a drop in interest rates, and that this will be reflected in their accounts for the first time. Canaccord Bell estimates that the Lobo deals of six to ten housing associations have been restructured so far, leaving many still on the books, with the new FRS 102 accounting rules "looming large".
