Hi

 

I called HMRC and asked them that the business is VAT registered but is
carrying out the activities in Asia, so is the procedure for VAT reporting.
It was informed that since we are not trading in UK so the business just
need to submit zero returns to HMRC (at regular intervals whenever the VAT
is due) .
