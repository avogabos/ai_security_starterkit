 Steve, 
please find it attached. 

Please let me know if you have everything on the passport side and if it can go through. 
I had to ask for new document from bank to translate and notarise it (English version was not accepted by notary services). To save some time i can just give the original letter from the bank and you won't need the notary, right? 

thanks,
Alex

Hi Steve,
as we discussed yesterday we will do the notary of proof of address document
and it should be with you by mid-next week.
regarding passport - this is the best we can do. we checked with notary they
don't stamp if it is international passport (it is law in Russia).
the other question i have is about Apostilled documents. As part of the
registration package - do you provide Appostille for: memo, reg certificate,
appointment of director?
thank you

Dear Alex
We have received the
documents, but proof of id documents is very confusing.
First of all, it is not in
English, I believe all passports have information in Local language and English
language.
Then you have sent so many
pages, we only need front of passport, where we can see your picture, name,
date of birth, passport number, issue and expiry date and signature.
Please note I am mentioning
again what we would need from you for due diligence.
Scan copies of
following documents are required for company owner/director/s.
1. Proof of ID
- Valid Passport (Notarized within last 3 months)
2. Proof of
Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest
personal bank/credit card statement. (Notarized within last 3 months)
If documents
are not in English, then you are required to have them translated and
notarized.
We would also
need the above documents by post at:
Mr. Tahir
Hussain
Formations
House
29 Harley

If you require
further information or assistance you can contact me at
