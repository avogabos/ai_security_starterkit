Re: MB Capital Ventures : website
Dear Steve,
thank you very much for the update.
Please find attached the corrections that need to be made and pls tell me if you will put in the end of all pages the copyright trademark and the current year as it appears on all websites.
I will be waiting for the cards and your advise on that.
Kindly tell the graphics dept to forward to me the logo of the company and the letterhead so that I can put it in my Facebook site and twitter and use it in my signature for my outgoing e-mails
thank you very much once again.
Best regards,
Maria
