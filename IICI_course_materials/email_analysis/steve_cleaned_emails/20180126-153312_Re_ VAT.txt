HiSteve
Many thanks. I updated the address in the records as
instructed.
It still shows £500 + the £100 the Vat element to renew
Global Tourism Investments, shall I just send the £500 by bank transfer and
advise when done?
Best
Phil

Hi
Steve
For
renewal of this company, please note it is Sey based company and not registered
for VAT, so you should not need to charge us VAT - the invoice should be made
to GTI with Sey address, then you do not need to charge VAT?
