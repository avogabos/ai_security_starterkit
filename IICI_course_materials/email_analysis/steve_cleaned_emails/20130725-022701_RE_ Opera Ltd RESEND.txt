Hi Steve

thks for the concession in the pricing.
I still have a problem with the price for following reason: My partner has 2 to 3 diffferent reliable offers for readymade companies in UK with the same content like your offer but for a price of between 1700 - 1900 Sterling Pound. Still I would like to continue  with formationshouse due to our past business relationship (DIVA Ltd.) Could you come a little bit closer to that price maybe So I can have some argumnet here in the company for taking your offer. I would appreciate a lot, thks Steve
