Anyhow, I have made the payment again online using the company Barclaycard, and it appears the payment went through.

Please check on your side and update me on this.

Hi Madhu,

We do give trading discount to our resellers, new resellers are given 10% discount on the total amount of the invoice.

In UK company it is mandatory to appoint 1 human director after that shareholders and other directors can be corporate. For corporate entities due diligence we would need following documents:

1. Company Documents presenting beneficial owner name (Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles)

2. Proof of ID (Valid Passport) and Proof of Address (Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.) of the beneficial owner of the Corporate body.(Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)

Hi Steve

Thanks for your email.

What due diligence documentation would you require if the shares in the company were being transferred to one of our own companies who would hold the shares as Nominee for our client?

Secondly, are you able to offer a trade discount on the price quoted, so that we can add a margin to cover our costs?

I wait to hear from you

Hi Madhu,
We do give trading discount to our resellers, new resellers are given 10% discount on the total amount of the invoice.
In UK company it is mandatory to appoint 1 human director after that shareholders and other directors can be corporate. For corporate entities due diligence we would need following documents:
1. Company Documents presenting beneficial owner name (Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles)
2. Proof of ID (Valid Passport) and Proof of Address (Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.) of the beneficial owner of the Corporate body.(Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)
Regards
Steve….

Hi Steve
Thanks for your email.
What due diligence documentation would you require if the shares in the company were being transferred to one of our own companies who would hold the shares as Nominee for our client?
Secondly, are you able to offer a trade discount on the price quoted, so that we can add a margin to cover our costs?
I wait to hear from you
Regards
