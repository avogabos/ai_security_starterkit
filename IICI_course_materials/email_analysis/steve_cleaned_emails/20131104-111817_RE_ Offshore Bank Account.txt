Can you give me an update or a contact number that I can call at the bank to
make inquiry.

 

Also have you mailed my corporate documents and stamp to me as yet?

 

Regards,

Frank

strict rules and due diligence for opening an offshore bank account

They are doing their research in every way to prevent

We will get back to you as soon as we have any new update from the bank
