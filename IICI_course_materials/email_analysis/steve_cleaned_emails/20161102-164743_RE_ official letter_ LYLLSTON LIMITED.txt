Dear sir,

 

As we received your email with the attached letter from Companies House,

May we remind you that we sent our Template to the Account Center on the
21th of October.

 

Could you tell us if all the figures we gave you are correct and when can we
expect to have a draft of the balance.

Thank you,

 

Eric Gilly
