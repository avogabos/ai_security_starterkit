Hi there Steve


I left a voicemail this morning and wondered if you have had heard it.

I'm having difficulty with the online debit card payment. It says it is processing but nothing seems to go through.

Am I able to make a payment over the phone with you?

I am available for a call today between 12.30 and 1.30pm.


Many thanks
