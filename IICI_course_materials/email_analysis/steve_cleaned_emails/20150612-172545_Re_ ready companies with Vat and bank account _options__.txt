Hi, Steve.
About the shelf companies with bank accounts:
- the problem is that they have no Vat to trade immediately (and the Vat
registration takes 2 to 4 weeks...,
  almost as long as the bank account in a foreign country - outside
Europe...St Vincent);
About the ready made solutions:
- I think it can be a solution (having time/history of incorporation) but
with 2 to 4 weeks for Vat registration,
  and 4 to 6 weeks for the bank account, it's too long for this period (and
what I need).
Have you got a different solution for the bank account? (not UK and not St.
Vincent - it's too long. And/Or,
Have you got a solution for an immediate process and invoice (a few days),
even if I would make an order
of a ready-made company? (from 2014, or less), with Vat register and a
quick bank account?
The service you refer as ITS - Instant Trading Solution would be suitable
for this?
(in this case £1.500 will pay this service along with an order of an Ltd UK
company with Vat and account?)
Could you tell me more about it? (I which to have an UK Ltd or LLP in a buy
and sell process this month)
Thanks. Best regards,
Antonio
