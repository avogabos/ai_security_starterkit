Dear Marc, 

 

Please see attached letters. I would you advise you to act fairly soon on this. You need to sort your VAT returns out ASAP. 

Other mail also comes here but it is not government mail we don’t open it and it should not be coming if here if you do not have the Virtual Office Mail service.

 

Please if you need anything please deal with my colleague Steve. I am not always in the office and he can help you better than I can. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
