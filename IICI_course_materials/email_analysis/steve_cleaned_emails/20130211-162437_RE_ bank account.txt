They said they would still need to see him personally as they have to carry
out anti impersonation checks

Hi

 

One of our existing American customer visited RBS London last week. He is
now back in USA and wants us to open RBS account for him.

 

He mentioned that his documents have been stamped by bank.

 

Can we open his RBS account using those documents without his presence?
