Dear Sir

Re ? E R R G Limited ? 3113567

The above company was dissolved under Section 652a, on 9th December 1997.

The Administrative Restoration procedure does not apply to companies struck off the Register at their own request.

A company that has voluntarily applied to be struck off, can only be restored by an Order of Court.

Information regarding this process can be obtained from the Treasury Solicitors website- www.tsol.gov.uk , or from our website: www.companieshouse.gov.uk.

Please note, under the new Companies Act, the above company would have until 1st October 2015, to apply for its restoration.

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen

Restoration Department.
