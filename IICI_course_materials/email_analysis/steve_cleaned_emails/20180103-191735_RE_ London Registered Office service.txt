Dear Steve,

 

Thank you for your email. 

 

Can I have the full address, where the company will be registered? Although
our trading address will be in Newcastle, are there any meeting rooms at
this London location, which we can use when meeting our clients in London?
Can you provide any photos (of the building, meeting rooms, reception,
etc.)? 

 

Kind regards,

Berkant Gavaldji
