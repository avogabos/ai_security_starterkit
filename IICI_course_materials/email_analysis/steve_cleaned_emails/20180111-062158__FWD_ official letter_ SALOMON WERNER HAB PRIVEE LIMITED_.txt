Dear Steve,
thank you very much for your interest on the penalties of the Salomon Werner Hab Privee Ltd as reported in the attachment.
I have notice that the Fortune Investment & Consulting Ltd is still in "proposal of strike off" and that the Dormant Account is not visible. Tomorrow I have a meeting with the corporate director of the Fortune (my client), the Robo Advisor Capital AS www.roboadvisor.capital , that is the worldwide fiduciary of the Sarmaye Bank and the asset manager of the Fortune.
Can I reassure the client that the Dormant Account will be done?
Thanks in advance
Regards
Andrea
