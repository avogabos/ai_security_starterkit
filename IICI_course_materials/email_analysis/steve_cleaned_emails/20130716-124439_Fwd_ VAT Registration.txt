Hi Steve,

Attached is the PDF form the VAT Customer Service.

If you could please help me fill in these questions or point me in the
right direction so they approve this VAT request.

Let me politely remind you that all this time and hassle for me was due to
an error from your side, as I was clearly told over the phone I was buying
a company that was VAT registered and ready to start trading in 48 hours.

Thanks again for your help.
