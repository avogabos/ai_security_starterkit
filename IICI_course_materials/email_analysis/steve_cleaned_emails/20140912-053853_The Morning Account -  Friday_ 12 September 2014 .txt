Weir threatens to quit Scotland
Keith Cochrane, chief executive of engineering group Weir, has said the firm could relocate its headquarters if leaders of an independent Scotland could not give immediate assurances on the country's currency and tax regime. Mr Cochrane said: "Weir will only continue to be based here if the business environment…continues to support our ambitions. That means certainty over issues like currency, certainty over issues like taxation and certainty over issues like EU membership.” However, despite a relocation having minimal impact on the company’s manufacturing operations, Mr Cochrane said it would affect Glasgow commercially as the firm spends tens of millions of pounds a year on accountants and lawyers and other advisers locally. His comments come as major retailers such as Next, John Lewis and Asda voice concerns over price rises due to divergence in regulation, pensions and tax in the event of a Yes vote.

Carney: Scotland would need to increase taxes to keep the pound
Bank of England governor Mark Carney has published an analysis showing how much Scotland would be required to hold in currency reserves if it kept the pound. Mr Carney’s figures suggest Scotland would need to back its financial services industry to the tune of £95bn - a sum that would require spending cuts or tax increases worth £18,000 per person. In a BBC interview, Alex Salmond, a former RBS economist, appeared to concede that he had not factored in the tens of billions of pounds of sterling reserves Mr Carney said he would require using the pound without a formal currency union.

Pfizer still open to inversion
Pfizer’s CEO Ian Read has described the heated rhetoric against so-called "tax inversions" in the US as political theatre and stated the firm is still open to a potential tax-saving acquisition in Europe after failing in its pursuit of the UK's AstraZeneca. Mr Read predicted there would be no legislation by the US to block such deals in the near term because of a lack of support for action from Republicans.

SNP’s anti-free market stance will benefit the City
The Telegraph’s Allister Heath comments on Alex Salmond’s fiscal policies for an independent Scotland, suggesting that despite making the right noises on corporation tax, the private sector will look at broader business issues before deciding to invest there, such as costs, local productivity and the personal tax rates that their key staff would face. Mr Heath argues, however, that the “SNP's aggressive socialism, its defence of a bloated public sector and the nationalist establishment's virulent dislike of free markets will put foreign investors off” and that ultimately, it is the City of London that will benefit from an exodus of Scotland’s finance industry.

Property tax-dodgers targeted
The Independent i’s Alex Johnson notes that HMRC has launched a new task force in the North-west of England and North Wales to tackle unpaid CGT on property sales or undisclosed rental income and aims to collect £5m. Task forces are expected to bring in more than £100m during 2014-15 writes Mr Johnson.

HP accused of excessive forecasting of Autonomy synergies
Former Autonomy chief Mike Lynch has hit back at Hewlett-Packard following the release of legal documents illustrating HP’s reasoning behind its acquisition of Autonomy in 2011. HP had predicted $7.4bn in “revenue synergies” but $5.3bn of these were later written off. HP said “accounting misrepresentations” were at fault for $5.5bn of the writedown following the purchase, but Mr Lynch argued that “Autonomy’s management cannot be held responsible for HP’s excessive forecasting”. HP has indicated that it plans to sue Mr Lynch, Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy’s former CFO, and Deloitte, the UK company’s auditor. Deloitte has said that any claim against it is “without merit”.

Pensions shake-up see annuity sales fall

IMF warns Yes vote could ‘upset’ markets
IMF spokesman Bill Murray has said markets could be upset in the short term in the event of independence. "The main immediate effect is likely to be uncertainty over the transition to a potentially new and different monetary, financial and fiscal framework in Scotland," he said. “While this uncertainty could lead to negative market reactions in the short term, the longer term will depend on the decisions being made during the transition, and I do not want to speculate on this."

Digital currencies could threaten the economy
The Bank of England has warned that digital currencies – such as bitcoin – could threaten the economy if they become widespread. The BoE said that in the most extreme case, bitcoin’s decentralised payment system and finite supply could make central banks obsolete, create huge economic risks and trigger deflation. The bank added that even if bitcoin was fairly limited, sharp swings in value could threaten financial stability.
