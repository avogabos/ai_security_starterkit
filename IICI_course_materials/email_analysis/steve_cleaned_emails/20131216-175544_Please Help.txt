Steve,

Every time I try to process the order, if it doesn't goes through, I get a
Decline Mail. This time around even that is not there. Is everything
working Nice and Fine?

Please do let me know because I am not understanding the status of the
whole thing. It says *There are no pending invoices in your account *but
there is no Success mail or Decline mail.
