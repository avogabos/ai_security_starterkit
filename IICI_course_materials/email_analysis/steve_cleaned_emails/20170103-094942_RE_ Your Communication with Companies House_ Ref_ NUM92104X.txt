Dear Sir

Re – Global Four Limited - 9544950

The above company was removed from the Register, for non compliance, of its filing requirements.  

If the above company is required on the Register,  you can apply for it to be Administratively Restored.  To proceed with  this process, Companies House will require the following documents:-

 

 1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).  

 

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

 3) Annual Return form for the year ending – 

 16th April 2016, with the filing fee of £40.

 (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site  www.gov.uk). 

 

4) Accounts for the period ending -

 30th April 2016. 

Having checked our records, as the above company  was struck off the Register, prior to filing the Accounts for 2016, no  late filing penalty would have been generated, upon its restoration.

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.

Restoration Department.
