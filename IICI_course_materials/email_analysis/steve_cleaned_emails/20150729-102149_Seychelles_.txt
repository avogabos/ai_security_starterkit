I was looking at your Seychelles off shore business package £340.00
What is the additional cost of opening a bank account and PayPal account there for my internet business
and can you tell me what currency would my funds be held in by the bank?
Customers buy in euro, GBP and USD.
Also can the company hire staff in the Seychelles and or rent property there?
Thanks,
