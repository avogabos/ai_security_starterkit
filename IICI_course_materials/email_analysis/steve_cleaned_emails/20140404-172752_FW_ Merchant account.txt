Hello,

I am inquiring about your merchant account solution:
http://www.formationshouse.com/merchant_account_opening.htm

Will you accept a Panama company for this?

  Can we use a low-level integration method where we accept the credit/debit card from our website and pass it to the payment gateway.?

  What do you need from us to proceed with this?

Thank you,
Anthony
