Hi Rebecca,

 

I hope you are keeping well?? 

 

We are still having some problems with this Swiss postal address.  Some post
is getting through ok, but we have been notified that 2 mail deliveries [one
via post last week, and one via FedEx] have not been delivered to the Zurich
address.  You can see as per email below to one of my colleagues.  Can you
please advise??

 

Thanks and regards

 

Martin

Dear Maria

As per your request I have sent the documents to the address of your new
office in Zurich. The package arrived today but the courier did not find
your office in that address. Before they try again to deliver the docs
they had requested a confirmation of the address or an alternative one if
not they will return the package to me.

Therefore I would like you to tell me where and when you will be in the
new office or please give me an alternative site to Fedex to deliver the
package.

Thanks in advance for your urgent reply

All the best
