Dear Sir,

 

Thank you for your mail regarding Annual Account for our company LYLLSTON
LIMITED for the accounting period ended 29th February 2016.

I do approve over the accounts so you may proceed with e-filing of the same
with Companies House, so we can pay our Corporation Tax to HRMC in due time.

 

Thank you for your attention,

Best regards,

 

Eric Gilly
