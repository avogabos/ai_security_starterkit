Mr. Wasbauer,

 

Thank you for showing interest in our services. Kindly let me answer your
queries point by point.

 

Company Formation:

There are three major requirements for incorporation of a UK Private Limited
Company:
a. Director: A UK Private Limited Company requires having at least 1
director.

b. Registered Address: A UK Private Limited Company requires a registered
office address in UK, where Companies House and HMRC send the relevant
notification documents.

We can surely assist you with our Registered Address service. It costs 25
GBP / Annum; it can ONLY be used to serve the basic requirements of
incorporation. You cannot use this address as your trading address of your
company. If you wish to use same address as trading address of your company
you will require purchasing our virtual mailing address service.

c. Share Structure and Shareholder: A UK Private Limited Company (Limited by
Shares) requires having a share structure and shareholder. Share structure
is determined by the number of shares x value / share. (Our online
company formation form will ask you for all these details on step 6. Since
the share structure is of nominal value, you are not required to pay the
calculated amount to any government authority. It is only there to determine
the ownership of the company. Hence you will be required to assign at least
1 share to a shareholder, which can also be the director of the company.)
