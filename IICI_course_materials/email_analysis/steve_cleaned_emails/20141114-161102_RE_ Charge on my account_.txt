Please explain that we process card payments for a number of merchants, Accounts Centre is a payment collection agency.

 

We will need his name and address and if possible the card number and we can track it in the system and tell him which merchant charge it is

The amount GBP 2315 was charged from my debet card at October 22 according to attached copy. I believe it is a mistake. We have not ordered anything from you. Please check and come back ASAP.

 

Kind regards,

 

Tore Burman
