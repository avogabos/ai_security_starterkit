OK thanks,

Hi
Andrea & Federico,
Company DUE MUSIC is only using our registered address services, in which only mails form Companies House and HMRC are received and scan copy is forwarded to clients on their authorize email address.
Since service do not allow you use our address as your general mailing address therefore there are no mails on hold for your company DUE MUSIC.
