  Dear Steve,

Thanks for getting back to me. I have some questions below regarding 
purchasing the ready made company.

After searching on your website there is a company in specific that I am 
interested to buy which is CONTROL TELECOM LTD

1) Will I be able to change the name of the company after wards.

2) This company status is 99999 - Dormant Company and also when you 
click on order more information on this company on the companies house 
website you get AA    22/01/2013     ACCOUNTS OF DORMANT COMPANY MADE UP 
TO 30/11/12 . is this public records already and can't be removed. if 
Yes, do you have other companies that wouldn't show DORMANT in the 
company filing history ? if yes, does it make a difference in the price?

3) Do we get to know the history of the shareholders, directors of this 
business ?

4) Are there any guarantees that this company never traded before and 
doesn't have any financial obligations.

5) I am also enquiring about some of your add-ons and what would that 
reflect such as

A) what is the difference between the director privacy service and 
nominee director

B) Bank account opening... do we get a bank account for the company when 
we purchase a ready made company from you ? if yes, how does the 
signatory transfer process work ? and who is the current signor ? please 
note that I am not a resident or a citizen of the U.K.

6) On your website it also mentions that you provide a merchant account. 
do the ready made companies also come with a merchant account because 
its not mentioned in the add-ons. how much does it cost ? and what type 
of merchant account is it ? who is the provider ? please advise with 
more details.



Awaiting your updates.


Regards,
Khaled
