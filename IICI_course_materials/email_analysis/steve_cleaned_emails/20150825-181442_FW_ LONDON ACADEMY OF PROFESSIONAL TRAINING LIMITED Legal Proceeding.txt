Dear Neeti Raj SIngh,

 

Re:LONDON ACADEMY OF PROFESSIONAL TRAINING LIMITED

 

We are about to file a claim in the county court against you and your company. 

It is with deep regret that we are forced to do this for a small amount of money, as the legal fees will far exceed the amount of money owed.

We would urge you to login into your account the details of which are given below and renew the services so your company is once again in good standing. 

Once we have obtained judgement against and YOU and your company, we will only settle for the amount + legal fees. 

The court judgement will seriously effect your ability to do business in the future and you will found that most banks will refuse to open a bank account and in fact many will close existing accounts. . 

Your Login ID is as under :

Customer ID: 997902

Please contact us if we can be of any further assistance with any requirement of your company maintenance.

PS: If you have already paid and renewed the service than kindly disregard this notice.

Sincerely,

The Support Team, 
FormationsHouse
