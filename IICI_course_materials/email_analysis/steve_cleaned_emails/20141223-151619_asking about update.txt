Hello, Steve!

Thank you for taking care of me and updating me what is going on
with the registration of my Honk Kong Company!

I have forwarded to you the last two mails sent to Delphine,
without any answer, nor update.

Pls let me know about the status of the registration.

Thank you in advance for your time and efforts.

Best regards,
