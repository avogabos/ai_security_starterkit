Hello,
Thanks for your feedback.
Regarding the formation of a trust, can it have a bank account (wherever that may be) and accept instruments made out to it, for example a check made payable to "ABC Trust", which would then be deposited into its bank account, account in its name, wherever such may be, etc., etc.? Were you saying that even a trust cannot be arranged through you, without exposing my identity, or did you just mean for a corporation formation?

If the trust can be arranged, based in Gambia, I'd have no problem with that, provided there's no hidden problems with it at that location (let me know, if so).
As to banking - yes, I'm aware of what the U.S. government is doing to U.S. citizens. So are there any countries and/or locales left where I could arrange banking for the trust, etc.? Austrian banks used to offer "password" accounts - where to open one all you need give to the bank is a password and whomever uses that word can gain access, etc., but no identities are ever given. Do these still exist, in Austria or elsewhere?

(Just to inform you, and for due diligence, I'm NOT affiliated or associated in any way, shape or form with any government agency or Interpol. I'm simply working to gain my financial security and privacy, in light of what's going on in today's world, the U.S. in particular.)
Your feedback is appreciated.
ThanksMike

1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport

The underlying purpose is strict business and personal privacy and

Would a trust setup work, to hold the brand name and be the legal
business entity that can have banking, in a country with banking secrecy, and
conduct business transactions, as described? If so, if understood correctly,
the U.S. person would need to have a person that could act as the Trustee - does
this come with the service for a trust you offer, or could the U.S. person act
privately in all three roles of a trust? And finally, would any other type of
