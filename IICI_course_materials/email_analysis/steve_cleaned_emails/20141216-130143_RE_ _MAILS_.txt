Dear Steve,

 

Whenever I call Delphine is on vacation !!!!

 

I paid all the expenses that you asked me.

 

I have Barclays mails with my new credit card that arrived home and I need now to be paid the bills for my company.

 

Delphine I'm promised to send me this last Friday and I still have not received the tracking number.

 

If I do not get this tracking within 30 minutes, I go to court against your company!!!!
