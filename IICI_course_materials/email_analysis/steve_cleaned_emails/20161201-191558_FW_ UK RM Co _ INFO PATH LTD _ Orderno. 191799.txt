Hi Shawn,

 

Sorry, I know it’s awkward but again this is probably not something we could accept.

 

Maybe give her the choice from the following:

- Statement from a financial services provider (e.g. a bank or a credit card statement)

- Utility bill (e.g. electricity or water provider)

 

from the past three months.

 

Thanks a lot

Hi Elliot,

 

Please find attached proof of address provided for the agent.

 

It is from e-toll (South Africa)

 

e-toll (in South Africa) consists of the electronic toll collection (ETC) processes employed by South Africa's roads agency Sanral on selected toll roads or toll lanes, subject to the Sanral Act of 1998.

 

Could you please check and verify if this would be acceptable or not?

 

Awaiting your confirmation.

 

Regards,

 

Shawn
