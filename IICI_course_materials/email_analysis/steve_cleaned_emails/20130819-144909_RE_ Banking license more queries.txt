Subject: RE: Banking license more queries
From: "Charlotte Pawar" <cpqueries@accountscentre.com>

The Provisional Licence will enable the new entity to open banking
facilities with a sponsoring bank initially, and to use any terms relating
to banking in the Company Name. The provisional licence does not allow the
newly incorporated bank to begin actively trading as a bank.

 

If we don't need a sponsoring bank, would the provisional licence also be
given? We won't begin trading as a bank in the first 6 months. The time will
be used to fulfill the requirements for a full licence.

 

Yes, but how will the new bank accept funds or manage funds without a
depositing account?

 

Once the provisional licence is issued, the Bank entity has 6 months to
fulfil a number of obligations before it mayapply for a full licence. The
obligations are as follows:

 




- An experienced board of directors to be appointed 

Could you find the experienced board of directors in Gambia to work with us?
We can source a board of 3 directors and then include one director from your
side. We will need to know the trading activities in detail or source the
right level of experience. Cost of the board will be £75,000 per year



- Detailed Business Plan including service provisions and planned capital
activities 

Could you provide the businessplan which is suitable for (Gambia central
bank?)  License is issued by the Gambia Government Ministry  - possibly but
we need to see activities first 



- Documented Risk Management, Data management and Compliance procedures 

-Evidence of access to sufficient capital to support the business plan 

How much is the capital? $50,000



-Implementation of approved Banking Software and infrastructure 

-Once these obligations have been met, the bank may apply for a full Banking
Licence 

Setting up a bank is a hard and serious business, it will be better to have
face-to-face meetings between our investors and officials of central bank or
department of state in Gambia. Could it be possible to arrange such meeting
at a proper time during the applying process?

 

You can arrange to see the advisors however you will be unable to meet with
the administration team in Gambia for the application. The operate a closed
system to ensure licenses are issued on the merit of the business and not
any external influences.

 

Please advice
