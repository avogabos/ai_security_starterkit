Dear
Massimiliano Iadecicco
The minimum
requirement for UK company is to have 1 shareholder holding minimum 1 share.
Therefore for 1 company you purchase only 1 Nominee Shareholder service and Nominee
Shareholder holds only 1 share.
Please note
that Nominee Services are only available at the time of company formation. So,
if you are thinking to purchase Nominee Shareholder service for FROZEN Â YOGURT
LTD then it is not possible.
If you
require further information or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone
or by live chat on our website.
