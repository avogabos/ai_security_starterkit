Hello Adbel
Company ‘Resource Central Limited’ is registered as a general company which can do any kind of business worldwide. Last year when filing annual return for the company, business activity was defined as ‘
82990 - Other business support service activities not elsewhere classified’.
When you will purchase the company, we will file applications with company registrar for resigning our director and shareholder and appointing your director and shareholder. Once these applications are processed, we will then file Annual Return for the period of Feb 2015-Feb2016 and for this annual return you can provide business activity of your own choice related to media. You will be required to choose a specific numeric code from the attach file which will define business activity.
Regards
Steve
