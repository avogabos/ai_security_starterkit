Subject: Price update inquiry & cooperation proposal

Dear Mr. Smith,

We would be interested in your services. Could you please give us details
of the services that you provide? I would be particularly interested in
several price updates:

- Is the price of virtual office is 275 GBP/year actual? What does this
price include? If a client wants only business address without any office
services is that price final?
- Do you offer price packages for company incorporation + virtual office
for 1 year?
- How much is VAT registration and EORI registration?
- How much is nominee shareholder service including all fees?
- Accountancy is 300 GBP - is that price actual in case of a dormant
company?

I would also like to know if you offer special prices for partner
companies. We are building the network of business partners in order to
expand our services and activities into other countries.

Our company, ALTAXO SE is the leading international incorporation services
group that serves clients in the Czech Republic and abroad. Our services
include particularly business and tax consultancy, company incorporation,
offshore company registration, virtual offices and we also offer shelf
companies registered in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. We are
specialists in accountancy services, corporate and labour law and all tax
optimalization and administrative procedures.


We have more and more clients interested in offshore companies, that´s why
we aim to intensify our cooperation with foreign companies with same
activities as ours. What we can offer to you is full business service in
the Central and Eastern Europe, virtual offices in the Czech Republic and
Slovakia, acountancy and immigration management including work permits and
permanent residence permits.

Thank you in advance for your answer and I look forward to our further
cooperation.

S pozdravem/Kind regards,
