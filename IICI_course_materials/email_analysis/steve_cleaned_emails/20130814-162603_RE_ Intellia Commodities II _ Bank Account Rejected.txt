You need to speak with tahir about the issues in branch, or whoever arranged
the appointment as I didnt

And the client should always be asked not to give such high figures

Uk banks are sensitive with large trading companies who are newly setup

They should have kept figures lower

We have no other solution except offshore where the banks are more equipt
for this.

Hi

 

Following message is from customer

 

 

We have been to Barclays Bank on the 6 th. August last week for a meeting
with Manager Izabella Wilz who could not do anything else than take copy of
our Belgian Identity Card due to the fact that this Branche only deals with
clients that have an estimated yearly turnover of maximum 250.000 GBP. We
ourselves have 100.000.000 US$ yearly turn over planned and have been
directed to another branch for whom we had to fill in a pile of papers.


This is only to let You know there is a difference in clients for them;
maybe good for You to know before You send some new clients to the bank

 

 

We have paid for a bank account upfront and it does not seem to be possible.
You make us pay without even knowing if it will ever be possible. We have
made costs to travel to London were even in the wrong Barclays branch.
Without this bank account it is really useless for us to have a company in
the UK. We claim back our money or You have to solve that banking problem
for us.

 

 

 

Customer do not wish to have offshore bank account.

 

 

Please advice
