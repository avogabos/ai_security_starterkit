Hi Nadya,

 

Nice to hear from you again and thanks for getting the pre-approval.

 

This application is borderline yes/no because we don't set up accounts for
the purpose of doing pass-through transactions, and it looks like the
purpose of this client's account with us is to wire money to buy an asset.

 

However, we may be able to work with them if it's mutually beneficial.

 

Can you give us permission to contact the client and learn more about her?

 

Lastly, please send the documents into accounts@europacbank.com so I can
assign the case to one of my associates. Thanks!

 

 

Regards,
