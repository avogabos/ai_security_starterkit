Passport attached

The company will need a bank account but I may sort that out separately as there will  not be huge numbers of transaction.

All work will be conducted in the UK.

We will be providing marketing services to UK based business consultancies. 

Is that enough information for you?

Do you know when you may be able to get back to me?

Kind regards 

Robert
