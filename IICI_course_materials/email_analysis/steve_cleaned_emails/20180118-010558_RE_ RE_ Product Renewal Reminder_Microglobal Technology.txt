Dear Mike Liang

 

Since services renewal and annual filings are OVERDUE and company
dissolution process takes 4-6 months for company to marked as Dissolved, the
better practice is to renew the services, do the annual filings and then
file company strike-off application for GBP 90/-.

 

And yes for BVI company I made a typing error, BVI company is valid till 16
May 2018
