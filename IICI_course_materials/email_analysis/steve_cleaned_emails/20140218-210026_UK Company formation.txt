Subject: UK Company formation

Dear Steve Smith,

Thank you very much for your prompt answer.

Basically what I am being requested (and have already half a dozen
potential clients), is:

- UK Company formation;
- UK Bank account;
- Virtual office;

The virtual office would be running until they open their businesses
physically here in the UK.

I am also recommending the accountancy service. So, for budgeting purposes
and to present the "whole pack" to the final clients I just need to know if
you are able to provide the virtual office as well. No need for telecom as
I run a telecom company and I can provide them with UK landline numbers for
both telephone and fax.

Best Regards,

Mario Gaspar
