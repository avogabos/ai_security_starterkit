** Companies trends for 2017
------------------------------------------------------------
Last year brought huge disturbance to the international investors, caused by introduction of CRS ( read about CRS in our blog) (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=092f0afc73&e=267b4f0486) and change of corporate banking policy throughout the world. Here are some challenges we can foresee in 2017:
* US$ transactions, especially when you run those with an offshore company, which has EU bank account.
* Harder bank compliance with more requests for fulfilling obligations on bookkeeping and tougher requirements on UBO’s profile and source of wealth.
* Multiple layers companies, which complicate bank compliance.
* Passive registered office, passive nominees and overall lack of substance. These requirements are implemented in the upcoming VISA regulations and will by far complicate the work of online-trading companies.

In these regards, we can expect the End of Tax Havens. If you still run a BVI or Panamanian companies, if they still have corporate accounts active, think of re-locating your assets to other less offshore looking jurisdictions. Consider UAE, Canadian LP, Gibraltar or Hong-Kong instead. Hurry up until your bank makes this decision in your place.

One can foresee as well the End of UK era: an open register of Beneficial Owners is already active for UK Limited companies and LLPs, and is likely to come soon for Scottish Limited Partnerships
- read more about PSC register (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=d405254657&e=267b4f0486) . Moreover, Companies House launches discussions now on overuse and abuse of Scottish Limited Partnerships.

Take some tips, if you still wish to use tax-free, nob-resident and offshore companies:
* Avoid US$ transactions, if you work with EU banks. If business allows, fulfill transactions in EUR.
* Keep accounting records and prepare year-end financial statements, even though those are not submitted to the government of the offshore state. We have an offer for you! (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=7c59ea1a07&e=267b4f0486)
* Add substance to your company: set-up a virtual office or representative office in the EU, make a web site. We have an instant offer for you (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=3946582644&e=267b4f0486) : fast branded web-site for EUR850!
* Have an alternative bank account to a backup in case one gets blocked. Ask us for easy bank account (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=2b94f63680&e=267b4f0486) opening options for your company.
* Keep the structure as simple as possible: avoid corporate directors and shareholders. When possible place your own director and shareholder in the company.
