Hi Steve,



Before I proceed, could you answer the following questions;



- I'll be registering the company as the holding company of shares in various UK companies. I assume this is completely legal and fine assuming I pay relevant corporation taxes and PAYE in each UK company.



- The company will also be used for various geographically independent businesses. As in online businesses, with no physical product or presence. All work is and management is outsourced to India/Philippines. Can you advice as to the legality of doing this in terms of tax? 



- How anonymous can the business be? I'd like minimal connection with it, regardless of legality, purely to protect my privacy and assets. 



Look forward to your response,

Kyle
