I told client that we do not process certificate of fiscal residence and in
reply client said:

 

'but I need the Certificate of fiscal Residence, or any document that says I
paid my taxes to the UK goverment

 

how can we do that? plus I need this document yearly or at least every 2
years.'

 

Advice please.
