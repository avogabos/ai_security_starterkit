Firstly please find out who will take over these companies and when would they be looking to come to uk to do so.

 

We will work out the services that can be credited, but anything that has been generated by the registry in gambia already cannot be credited.

Hi

 

 

The client for above companies paid us USD 3270 for Gambia companies with bank account and additional services (invoices attached). However we were only able to provide him the companies, rest of the services were never delivered.

 

Now Customer wish to have 2 UK readymade companies with bank account.

 

Please advice.
