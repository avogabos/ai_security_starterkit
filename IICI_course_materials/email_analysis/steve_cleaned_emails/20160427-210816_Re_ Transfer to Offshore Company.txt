Thank you Steve. 
I believe most likely a BVI company will be the most suitable solution for me. 
What means "Apostille set of BVI company documents for bank account processing" and why do you need it? 
Can I still keep my UK limited license in this case just for my business cards and invoice through the BVI company?
Last you don't have any other options for the bank account to be based in Europe or maybe the UAE?

Dear
Stefanie,
Income Tax is on company’s director income, and you have to
see the laws of residing country in this regard.
A UK private limited company whether doing business in UK or
outside UK is liable for corporation tax and company director income can be
taxed as per the laws of director’s residing country. To minimize corporation
tax in UK because you will be doing business outside of UK using a UK company,
you can register a UK LLP (Limited Liability Partnership). Using UK LLP when you
are doing business outside of UK, the corporation tax will be ‘0’
but company partners will be liable for income tax on their income from the
company as per their residing country. For example you are partner 1 and living
in UK, you are liable for income tax in UK on your earnings from the company.
WE can certainly assist you in registering a BVI company, as director’s
residential address you can provide  your UK address but BVI company registered

Many thanks for the clarification. I just have a few more
questions:
1. Do income tax also apply when you are residing in the UK and
your business is outside the UK?
2. Can I set up the offshore BVI company in addition to the UK
company so I can keep the UK company address?
3. What are the minimum costs to open a BVI company? Plus
assistance to open a bank account.
4. In which countries can you set up an offshore bank account for

Dear Stefanie,
You can have an offshore company to minimize taxes. Having an
offshore company gives you the advantage to minimize corporation tax to
‘0’ but as far as income tax on company director’s income,
you have to abide the law of your country of residence.

Dear Steve,
Many thanks for your prompt reply.
Yes, I am interested in registering a new offshore company. My
main reason are taxes, so probably for this reason I would need to close my UK
company?
I am a German citizen living in Dubai but I might move to the UK
soon. What is important for me that either ways I would avoid paying both
company and income tax.
Could you confirm this?
