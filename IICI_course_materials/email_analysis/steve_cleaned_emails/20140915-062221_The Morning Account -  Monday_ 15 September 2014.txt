Profit rise gives PwC partners highest pay since 2010
PwC’s 854 partners received an average of £722,000 in 2013/14, up £11,000 and their biggest payout since 2010. PwC has benefited from a shake–up of audit contracts among many FTSE 100 groups, enjoying a 6% rise in revenues in assurance, the group's largest division, which includes the auditing operation. Vodafone, HSBC and Morrisons have all switched to PwC, which has 40% of FTSE 100 auditing work. Its nearest rival KPMG has 24%. Overall pre-tax profits for the UK partnership rose by 5% to £793m on the back of revenues of £2.81bn, also up by 5%. PwC’s chairman, Ian Powell, is to receive a £3.7m share of profits. In its annual report, published today, PwC says: "The world is changing, and our focus over the last year has been to continue to adapt, transform and diversify our business."

Scotland vote will impact on UK globally
Writing in the FT, Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, looks at the impact the Scottish referendum might have on the UK’s financial services sector should Scotland vote Yes. He says the sector is the largest export earner and attracts more FDI than any other sector, supporting 2m jobs from London to Edinburgh. Mr Cummings says a break-up would weaken the UK internationally and cites estimates from PwC that indicate calmer trading conditions could see financial services add £62bn to annual economic output by 2020, with Scotland benefiting most. The 177,000 people in Scotland who work in the financial and related accountancy, consultancy and legal sectors, also need to know what is at stake, adds Mr Cummings.

EU firms shun dealmaking
European firms risk losing competitiveness against US rivals as they continue to avoid spending their cash on deals, writes Sarah Gordon in the FT. Despite global M&A activity rising, EU companies continue to lag behind, says Ian Macmillan, head of M&A at Deloitte in London. "If European companies want to achieve double-digit growth, then they need to consider M&A activities as part of their growth strategy." Mr Macmillan adds that US M&A activity has been driven by tax inversion while EU dealmaking has focused on emerging markets, which have been struggling and have therefore dampened growth.

Phones 4U collapses
Phones 4U has collapsed into administration after EE followed Vodafone and O2 in pulling out of contracts with the retailer. BC Partners, Phones 4U's private equity owner, said it would seek to appoint PwC as administrators on Monday. John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones 4U, who sold it in 2006, said he felt “these networks are acting in unison”, adding that he also “did not agree with a healthy business being stripped and debt laden”.

Film partnership tax probe
Geoffrey Cox QC, Britain’s highest earning MP, is one of hundreds of wealthy figures and celebrities who have put cash into Phoenix Film Partners LLP, an alleged tax avoidance scheme being investigated by HMRC, according to the Daily Mirror.  Phoenix, among several film financing projects set up by Ingenious Media, is one of 1,200 schemes identified by HMRC as being designed to avoid tax. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is one celebrity who joined the Ingenious Media partnership, but he left six months ago. Yesterday, he said he thought it was a "bona fide investment" with "government-approved tax relief ". But he added: "It seems from reports HMRC does have reservations. I want to be transparent, so this year I resigned my subscription and handed back all the tax gain I made, plus interest, to HMRC." Elsewhere, Michael J M Reid of Meston Reid & Co warns that many company directors were seduced by such schemes and the issuance of accelerated payment notices seeking disputed tax from companies could soon see many firms seeking corporate insolvency advice.

Tax incentives could improve home efficiency
The energy and climate change select committee has suggested discounts on council tax or stamp duty would encourage people to make their homes more efficient. The committee said households had shunned the Green Deal scheme introduced 18 months ago. "Stamp duty discounts and variable council tax rates could be used to broaden the appeal of energy efficiency improvements and make them even more of a money saver for households," Tim Yeo, the committee's Conservative chairman, said. "Extra incentives certainly need to be considered, as the Green Deal has delivered a fraction of the expected benefits so far."

Harder to hide from taxmen
Mark Watson, tax director at Johnston Carmichael's Aberdeen office, discusses the growing swell of regulation aimed at tackling tax avoidance in the Press & Journal. He points to the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) which compels financial institutions anywhere in the world to report information on US citizens to the US Inland Revenue Service and notes how UK bilateral information exchange agreements will report back to HMRC on UK residents.

SME confidence at record levels…except in Scotland
Confidence levels among small businesses are at "record levels", according to the Federation of Small Businesses. The northeast has shown the greatest improvement in sentiment compared with a year ago, and the southeast remains the most confident region overall. The FSB said every sector was positive about its trading prospects over the next three months. FSB chairman John Allan said: "We are seeing record–breaking confidence from our members, which suggests small firms will continue to spearhead the UK's recovery. We want policymakers to lock in this optimism." However, confidence among Scottish SMEs fell in the past three months chiefly over concerns about the impact of a Yes vote in this week's independence referendum.

SMEs join forces against RBS
About 800 SMEs that claim they were exploited and even destroyed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring arm are considering group action to seek compensation from the bank. The RBS GRG Business Action Group has appointed Clyde & Co to review allegations that viable companies were forced out of business. Lawrence Tomlinson published a report last year accusing GRG of charging struggling small businesses excessive fees and of buying their assets through the bank's own property division, West Register, after having undervalued them.

EIS tax reliefs under threat
EU proposals could see Enterprise Investment Scheme rules changed to remove tax advantages for investors backing businesses that are over seven years old. Radius Equity, an investment firm, said: "EIS investments have given a major boost to SMEs looking to grow and develop their potential, so any significant changes like this should be resisted.”
The Times, Page: 49   The Daily Telegraph, Business, Page: 4

Call to extend energy refunds
FSB chairman John Allan has called for energy companies to extend the repayment of funds held by customers who closed accounts and moved to other providers to small businesses. The companies have accumulated about £153m over the past six years. Mr Allan said: "Energy companies are sitting on money that does not belong to them and it is high time they paid it back - the industry's announcement is the first step to doing this but it is important that companies do not stop at only paying back domestic consumers.”
The Independent, Page: 51

R&D tax relief claims rise
Claims for Research and Development tax relief by SMEs rose by almost 30% to 13,010 in 2012-13, versus the previous year in August - the highest ever since the scheme was introduced in 2000. Andy Nash, R&D Tax Director at Baker Tilly, said: "Perceptions are changing, and many SMEs are realising that R&D tax relief isn't just for the manufacturing or tech sectors and can apply to many other sectors that are developing innovative products or processes."

Pensions tax relief set to change
Ian King warns in the Times that the Liberal Democrat pre-manifesto advocates a review of tax relief for pensions. A cut to the 40%- 45% of tax relief enjoyed by higher-rate and top-rate tax payers will most likely be on the cards, says Mr King, suggesting that dismissing a possible Lib Dem policy change as irrelevant could be a mistake as such a redistributionist policy could also appeal to Labour. Tax relief for pension contributions is set to change, whoever wins the election, so put as much money as you possibly can into your occupational pension this tax year, urges Mr King.

ECONOMY

Europe favours safety over growth
European companies may have changed their behaviour permanently, writes Sarah Gordon in the FT, preferring safety over growth opportunities. Chris Gentle, head of Emea research at Deloitte, says chief executives “have not been rewarded recently for taking risks” and that the “danger is that Europe will lose competitiveness in the long term.” Since 2010, a net balance of 41 European companies has exited the Global Fortune 500, the sharpest fall on record, writes Ms Gordon, adding that Europe’s listed firms are hoarding €250bn more cash that in 2007 with €963bn held in reserves. Mr Gentle said Emea business confidence “remains brittle.”
