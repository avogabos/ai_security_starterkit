Thank you so much Steve…

My Outlook at least is working perfectly now…


You are an angel.


I will be expecting the templates tomorrow for the future cards printing while I will wait to receive the actual first ones from you when you are ready.


Thanks again!


P.S. the only thing pending is the problem with the site that I can not get in to and use my Web service as you know but I will wait from your technical team to let me know
