Steve, 
We have just received the attached communication from HMRC.  It looks like we have been assessed an additional £100 for each Accounting Period, so now we are up to £400 total due:  £200 for each year.  Though I am confused by the dates of the reporting periods on these notices:

One letter and corresponding reconciliation statement lists the Account Period from 28 January 2009 to 27 January 2010
The other set of correspondence lists the Accounting Period from 28 January 2010 to 31 January 2010

Are they really asking for a return to be filed for the three days from 28 Jan to 31 Jan 2010? Why are they specifying Accounting Periods which are really the same periods:  year ending Jan 2010?

According to FedEx tracking, they received the tax return for the period ending 31 Jan 2010 on 25 May.   These notices are dated 18 May.

What is the status of obtaining online access?  Once you get this access information, please forward it to me so that I can go online, as well.  These notices indicate that I can access further details on their website.  I need to get this resolved before we incur any more charges.  Before I can write requesting a waiver of these penalties, I need to understand what they are for.

Thank you,
Stefanie

In fact, when we first received the notices to file the Annual Returns, I went to the HMRC website to try and file myself because I wasn't getting anywhere with Formations Houses.  When I tried to register, I received a message saying that someone had already done that.  As our representative, I assume it was Formations House that did it.

Steve,
We have just received the attached communication from HMRC.  It looks like we have been assessed an additional £100 for each Accounting Period, so now we are up to £400 total due:  £200 for each year.  Though I am confused by the dates of the reporting periods on these notices:

Steve,
Thank you, again.
I have FedEx'd the 2009 return.  You mention that I will receive confirmation that it has been received.  In what form does that confirmation come?
Please update me as you get more information about the pin for the online gateway.
Regards,
Stefanie

Please submit the 2009 Tax Return to HMRC and once you receive the confirmation that it has been received by HMRC you can then call them inform that your company has been dormant and asked them to remove the penalty.
As for your Tax Returns for 2010, it will be submitted electronically by us as soon as we receive the online gateway pin for your company.
Regarding submission of Annual Returns and DCA, those have been filed to Companies House for the year 2010. And now your next annual returns and accounts are due January 2012.
And regarding CT41G, it is not necessary for a non-trading to submit the this document, you can also mention this to HMRC  when will call for penalty waiver.

Re: Company ID 8138444
Steve,
Attached are the most recent letters fro HRMC.
I have not paid the penalties for the late tax returns.  Nor have I mailed the 2009 return.   I was waiting for the 2010 return so i could send them all together with a letter requesting waiver of the penalties.
However, I will mail the 2009 returns right away.
You say DCA has  been filed.  I assume this is for 2010.
Please confirm that the Annual Return has also been filed.  That is the £15 that was paid on April 26th.
At this point, I am inclined to just pay the £100 penalty on the tax returns for each year, just to clear everything up and nothing will be outstanding any more.  However, I would prefer to pay it through the online gateway, once access is received.  Do you know if online payments are allowed?
I also have a question about the CT41G:
It was issued by HMRC, and the instructions say I am to complete it and return it to them.  But, there is also a CT41G Dormant Companies Insert, which has a line that reads "The company is dormant, I have kept form CT41G and will send it back when the company becomes active".
I am uncertain as to whether or not I should send the CT41G WITH the Dormant Company Insert, or just send the Insert.  The form does say to read the Notes for New Companies for instructions, but I do not have those instructions and don't know where to find them.
Please advise how I should handle all of these latest issues.
Thank you,
Stefanie
