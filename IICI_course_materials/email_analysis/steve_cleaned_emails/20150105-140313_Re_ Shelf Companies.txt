Hi Steve,

Thanks for your email.

I will like to proceed with MEDIA SPIN LTD .

I have spoken to one of your collegues and he did mention that you have
some other shelf companies that were incorporated in  2009,  2010 ,2011.

If so, can you send me a list of those as well as they are not included in
the list i already have.

Many Thanks

Kevin
