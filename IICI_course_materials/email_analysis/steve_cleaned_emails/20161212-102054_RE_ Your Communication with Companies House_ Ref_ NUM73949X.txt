Dear Sir

LEASELINE AVIATION LIMITED

Thank you for your e-mail dated 8 December 2016.

I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved because the Confirmation Statement remained outstanding despite a number of letters being issued to the address listed as on our records as the registered office. This included one letter sent via recorded delivery. We also wrote to the director as the address listed as their service address. As we do not appear to have received any response, the Registrar of Companies had no choice but to believe that this company was no longer required and therefore took the necessary action to strike the company off the register.

I can also confirm that the following documents and fees are required in order to apply for this company to be administratively restored to the register:
 
Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website.

Annual Return(s) (form(s) AR01) for 30 April 2015. This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40 and can also be downloaded from our website.

Confirmation Statement(s) (form(s) CS01) for 3 July 2016.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40  and can also be downloaded from our website.  Please note that we require a minimum of Part 2 and Part 5 to be submitted with the Confirmation Statement.

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64.

I hope this information has been of some use to you.

Yours faithfully

C E Street (Ms)
