Dear Steve,

I have moved to the UK since 1st July 2015 and i have updated my details online also as follows :

Mrs Maria Banakou
The Flat
Northfield Farm
Redcoat Road
Faringdon
SN7 8DT
United Kingdom



I have everything required to proceed with the VAT registration of MB Capital Ventures, house lease, bank proof of address, TV license, etc.

I have already paid for the service of VAT registration as you remember and I will also need an account in the UK with Barclays but let;s finish the VAT first.

Let me know of the docs you need so that I can send them over and finish this part.

Thank you in advance for your kind help as always.

Kind regards,



Maro Banakou
