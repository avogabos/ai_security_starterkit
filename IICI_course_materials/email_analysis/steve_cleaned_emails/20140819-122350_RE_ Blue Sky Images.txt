Thanks for your note.
The difficulty here is they dont really operate an address system as mail is via post office boxes.
I have attached full copies of the two credit card statements and a copy of my Saudi Iqama (residence permit) which is valid until mid 2015.
Does this suffice?
Regards

Electronic versions of two of my credit cards from Saudi British Bank in Riyadh where I also have a villa. 
I trust this will suffice.
