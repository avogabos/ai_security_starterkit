Dear Steve, 

We are almost there…

they forgot to do the following according to my previous e-mail:

1.  In the HIME page the first sentence should start with CAPITAL letter “We” and there is an “e” missing from the word change
right now it reads : we help new business and young Entrepreneurs chang the world!

PLEASE CHANGE THE WHOLE SENTENCE TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

We help new business and young Entrepreneurs change the world!

2. in the services section I mentioned in the previous e-mail to remove all the (-)from the beginning of each sentence. Right now it reads:

 
SERVICES:

1. INTEGRATED SUPPORT
- Strategic direction and planning - Market insights Expert guidance/consulting  - Fully-integrated support - In-depth analyses Maximizing ROI

2. ASSET MANAGEMENT
- Structured Finance and Capital Markets - Acquisition finance General capital raising (debt and equity) - Debt refinancing & restructuring - Expansion and growth capital

3. PRIVATE EQUITY
- We provide debt and equity capital to viable enterprises Operational and financial restructuring of enterprises - We apply international strategic and operational partnerships (revenue, knowledge transfer, technology transfer, supply chain leverage etc.)



IT SHOULD READ:

Finnaly IF it is possible try to enlarge the photograph that is on the top on every page of the site since it looks pretty small and lower the wording of each page maybe three spaces down so that the page looks “full”.


Please make these small corrections so that we may get it live today if possible!!!

Thanks a million I will be waiting in anticipation.

Kind regards,

Maria

Dear Steve,
thank you very much for the update.
Please find attached the corrections that need to be made and pls tell me if you will put in the end of all pages the copyright trademark and the current year as it appears on all websites.
I will be waiting for the cards and your advise on that.
Kindly tell the graphics dept to forward to me the logo of the company and the letterhead so that I can put it in my Facebook site and twitter and use it in my signature for my outgoing e-mails
thank you very much once again.
Best regards,
Maria
