Yes Steve,

I am on my way to some work. Shall be sending you my passport and
statements in couple of hours from now and will also send the docs of the
other person that I want to add as director so that all the work can be
done in one go.

Please do add him up in the company. I shall mention in my next mail the
number of share allotments.

Thanks
Pratik
