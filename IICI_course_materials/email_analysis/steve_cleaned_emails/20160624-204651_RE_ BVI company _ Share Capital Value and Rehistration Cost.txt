Dear Rachel,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

The Government filing fee for a company authorized to issue over 50,000
shares is US$1,100.00.  The standard government fee for a company with
50,000 shares or under is US$350.

 

If you have any further questions, please let us know.

 

Kind regards,

Hi,

 

Is there any difference in registration cost depending upon share capital

And we only provide ordinary shares?

Common Shares authorized: 500,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001 per share 

Preferred Shares authorized: 50,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001 per share
