At this stage we don’t know, once we have the regular documents we will assess the risk and then advise you accordingly.

 

Have you been communicating with the customer by email? If so, would you be able to forward the emails to me so I could have a look?

 

Thanks a lot

 

Elliot

Hi Steve,

 

Just a quick line to say we will need to extensively check the ID documents for this transaction before we can confirm it can go through, so please manage the customer’s expectations.

 

Thanks,
