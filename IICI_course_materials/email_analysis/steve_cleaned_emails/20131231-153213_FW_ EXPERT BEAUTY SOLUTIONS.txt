Dear Steve 
 
I have realised, that I failed to inform you that the company is dormant, and no trading as a limited company has been done with it since the day set up, I run as a sole trader and wanted to protect the name of the company and have it ready for when I am ready to run as a limited company, which will not be at this present time.
 
So in this case I have no accounts to post, however please inform me what is required for me to do to meet any legal and companies house requirements.
 
I will be calling your office on the 6th to pay any outstanding cost required.
 
Wishing you a Happy New Year.
