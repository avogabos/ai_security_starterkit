Hong Kong is best for this, they don't have controls on the Intellectual
property type, the only thing to mention to the client is that getting a
bank account for the Porn channel will be difficult, but if the other
website has general Intellectual property content then it they could get an
account there.

 

The other thing to consider is that HK is an open registry so the owner of
the IP is known to public if they were to search, 

 

You can otherwise select another jurisdiction like BVI or Seychelles but
they don't have strong IP protection clauses and a third party can contest
any legal infringement easily. HK has fairly stringent (like UK) IP laws. 

 

Gambia is the final option but only as a property rights holding company
