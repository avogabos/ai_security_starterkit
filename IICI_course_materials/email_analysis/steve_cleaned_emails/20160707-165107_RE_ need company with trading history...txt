We cannot offer a company with existing credit lines only ones with a strong
credit rating

 

The LLP's we offer have such and they have filed accounts as active for the
last few years but do not have a current bank account. 

 

Credit reports are available if needed, Rizwan can advise more tomorrow

To whom it may concern,

We are looking to purchase a company with existing trading history. We
wanted to know what available options you have on offer and the approximate
total costs for acquiring such a company. Essentially we are looking for a
company that has at least a couple of years of trading history and that has
existing credit facilities.
