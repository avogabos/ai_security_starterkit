Re: ***SPAM*** Re:Open UK Business Bank Account
Thank you Mr. Smith,
We have a nominee director that won't attend the bank. We are therefore thinking about appointing one of us (we are two shareholders) as director, open the account and reappoint our nominee director.
I assume we would both have to travel to London if we want both to have valid use of the account.
How should documents be translated? Can we translate ourselves and have the translated version signed and witnessed by a Spanish sollicitor?
Would your service guarantee successful opening of bank account with RBS (ours is a UK company)? And what are the fees for the service?
Thank you,
Alain Ochoa
