Hi 

 

I see the customer issue but he hasnt thought about it logically.

 

When buying the Entrepreneur Starter Pack we do tell them that they should
be seeking legal advice for the application.

 

EIS is an option for raising investment, but the director needs to be in the
UK for this. 

Also, we state clearly on all information that we cannot guarantee that
funds will be raised as it is dependent upon how attractive the business is.
Visa rules state that to apply for the visa the entrepreneur must have
access to £200k in personal investment. Additionally they can use a Venture
Capital investment of £50k as part of this. 

 

We are not saying that he cant raise EIS funds for the business, but the EIS
fund raising cannot be conducted without him having access into the country.


 

He cannot expect that the amount paid would automatically entitle him to
£200k worth of investment, we can submit the business plan for HMRC approval
to market the business for EIS investment, but it wont guarantee it. No one
can guarantee investment. 

 

We will send the plan to HMRC for get approval first and then we will list
it on www.eisexchange.com

If there is interest it is likely the potential investor will want to meet
the entrepreneur and will need a bank account. 

 

Some additional notes are below next to the orders

Email from  Customer

 

Traveloday is formed and the VAT registration is done. Business plan for
entrepreneur pack is also completed. bank account is pending due
mynon-availability of business visa. It has been four months since i have
paid for the entrepreneur pack. It was agreed that the company will be
formed, the business plan done and funding will be arranged after which I
can apply for the entrepreneur visa. 

 

 

Kindly note that I will be able to come over the only on entrepreneur visa
and not on business visa. So bank account opening process is possible only
after that.

 

 

So kindly suggest me what is the next step so that my funding under the
entrepreneur pack can be completed.

 

 

In emails from Sarah, initially it was mentioned that we will arrange the
investment under EIS program and after few correspondence Sarah said to
customer

 

You need to now start trading in UK by apply for a business visa. You can
submit the visa application along with the business plan for the UK company.
Once your business visa is cleared and you will make investment in your
company and start trading in UK. After that we can rework the business plan
and possibly find investors for the company.

And now customer has complained:

 

Once the company is formed, we will work simultaneously on your graphics
project and a comprehensive Business plan will be created forÂ your proposed
company's business model based on the details that you will provide us and
it will be used for banks or other potential investors to raise up capital
for your proposed venture.

"

I reconfirmed the same and then made the payment for entrepreneur pack.
Nowyou are saying that invest the money and start trading and then you see
whether you can possibly raise the funds.Â 

Kindly note that as per the order terms the entire capital requirement has
be raised and that I dont have to invest any amount.
