Dear Smith,

You obviously did not give a humble request but in-fact you tried to force us to give you those funds using your "terms of service" to draw the wool above our eyes. Now since you realise what you were doing is illegal you are attempting to harden the process and also create further costs.

In your first e-mail you mentioned that one of the reasons we should leave the money is that for next years we wont have to send notarised IDs and proof of address if we paid in advance due to legislature. You strictly showed that we do not need to pay anything extra or do anything extra for this year.

You have never spoken to us about filing of register of directors to the BVI registry for this year, nor did you mention that it would cost 600 GBP. Furthermore, you increased the price of renewal from 700 to 900 without our approval and we had allowed this to slip in hope that we do not have any issues with renewal.

Furthermore during your first invoice and email you requested 900 only for one year renewal, why are there extra costs all of a sudden?

This is a NON trading company that does not have a bank account attached and has not done any trading. Since it is non-trading and has never traded we do not even legally need to renew it, we can keep it dormant, the renewal costs should be a small amount or nothing. 
We refuse to pay the bogus costs that you have added or accept the demands that you did not mention in the original e-mail, this is obvious an attempt to make our lives harder due to us not accepting your unfair policy which we have never heard about.
Thank you,

PS: Can we please speak to someone in charge, thank you.

Subject: GLOBAL MEDICAL TRADING LIMITED (BVI) : company renewal

Dear Mr. Ali Zardab

Thank you for renewing the your BVI company GLOBAL MEDICAL TRADING LIMITED.

But due some technical issue we received 4 orders and their payments forcompany renewal which was considered as company renewal for 4 years. As we nowhave been informed that you have requested a refund on payment of 3 additionalrenewal orders. As per our terms and condition(https://www.formationshouse.com/termsandconditions.php) on Credit and RefundPolicy:

‘Although we make every effort to provide reliable services, occasionaldisruptions or interference may occur due to circumstances beyond our control.At our sole discretion we will issue a credit when services are disrupted. Dueto the perishable nature of our services we do not offer refunds once a servicehas been ordered.’

Therefore we can either provide you with credit note on 3 renewal orders anduse the amount for any of your future orders or we can renew your company fornext 4 years. Renewing company for next 4 years can be more beneficial for youbecause any increase in the renewal cost in future will save you money becauseyour company will be valid for next 4 years and increase in price will notaffect you until company is valid.

Note that from this year BVI company renewal cost has increased. The actualrenewal cost of a BVI company is now:

- BVI Company Renewal : GBP 900 (per annum)
- Filing of Register of Directors : GBP 600 (per annum)
Total : GBP 1500 (per annum)

Your total payment received for 4 orders is GBP 3600. Therefore we suggestfollowing options which will benefit you in future:

- Option 1 : Using GBP 3600 we renew your company for 4 years and you payadditional GBP 600 to cover the filing of Register of Directors for this yearand for another 3 years you only pay GBP 600 per annum for register ofdirectors filing only. And during the period any increase in renewal fee willnot have any effect on your company.

- Option 2 : Using GBP 3600 we renew your company for 3 years and pay GBP 600for filing register of directors for 1 year for GBP 3300 will be used. Forremaining GBP 300 we can issue a credit note and you can use the amount for anyof your future orders.

Please advice which of the above option you wish to use and we will makechanges in your invoice and process your orders.

Also note that now on every annual company renewal you are required submitfollowing documents and information about director/s, shareholder/s and thecompany:

Documents:
1. Notarized Proof of ID - Valid Passport (bearer signature and completeinformation must be visible)
2. Notarized Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (waterOR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (issuedate, name, address and account number must be visible).

Information:
3. Company’s Business Activity Details
4. Company’s Source of Funds
5. Name of Countries where company is trading.

And by renewing for multiple years such as 4 or 3 years at one time you needsubmit above documents and information once in 4 or 3 years.

Please advice how you wish to proceed with your renewal of BVI company, do youwish to renew it for 1 year (GBP 900+600) and have credit note for theremaining amount or you wish to renew it as per above mentioned options 1 or 2.Along with your reply please also send above mentioned documents andinformation so that we can complete company renewal process as soon aspossible.

Dear Mr. Ali Zardab
Thank you for renewing the your BVI company GLOBAL MEDICAL TRADING LIMITED.
But due some technical issue we received 4 orders and their payments for
company renewal which was considered as company renewal for 4 years. As we now
have been informed that you have requested a refund on payment of 3 additional
renewal orders. As per our terms and condition
(https://www.formationshouse.com/termsandconditions.php) on Credit and Refund

‘Although we make every effort to provide reliable services, occasional
disruptions or interference may occur due to circumstances beyond our control.
At our sole discretion we will issue a credit when services are disrupted. Due
to the perishable nature of our services we do not offer refunds once a service

Therefore we can either provide you with credit note on 3 renewal orders and
use the amount for any of your future orders or we can renew your company for
next 4 years. Renewing company for next 4 years can be more beneficial for you
because any increase in the renewal cost in future will save you money because
your company will be valid for next 4 years and increase in price will not
affect you until company is valid.
Note that from this year BVI company renewal cost has increased. The actual
renewal cost of a BVI company is now:
- BVI Company Renewal : GBP 900 (per annum)
- Filing of Register of Directors : GBP 600 (per annum)
Total : GBP 1500 (per annum)
Your total payment received for 4 orders is GBP 3600. Therefore we suggest
following options which will benefit you in future:
- Option 1 : Using GBP 3600 we renew your company for 4 years and you pay
additional GBP 600 to cover the filing of Register of Directors for this year
and for another 3 years you only pay GBP 600 per annum for register of
directors filing only. And during the period any increase in renewal fee will
not have any effect on your company.
- Option 2 : Using GBP 3600 we renew your company for 3 years and pay GBP 600
for filing register of directors for 1 year for GBP 3300 will be used. For
remaining GBP 300 we can issue a credit note and you can use the amount for any
of your future orders.
Please advice which of the above option you wish to use and we will make
changes in your invoice and process your orders.
Also note that now on every annual company renewal you are required submit
following documents and information about director/s, shareholder/s and the
company:
Documents:
1. Notarized Proof of ID - Valid Passport (bearer signature and complete
