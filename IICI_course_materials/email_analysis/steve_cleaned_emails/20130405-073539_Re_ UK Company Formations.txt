Hi Karim
I have placed the orders for 3 companies. We are processing the
payment now, as soon as payment is processed, we will start company registration
process.
Regarding bank we are finalizing our deals with few offshore
banks right now, which will be done by next week. We will then be able to provide
you more information regarding those.
We have discontinued our services with offshore bank in Cyprus.
Regards,
Steve
