Steve:
Following our conversation of today, I'm attaching you the requested
documents. They are all ordered following your numbering points in your
e-mail below.

A remark: I'm Spanish and I have an address in Spain, but I currently
live in Colombia. I'm attaching both proofs of address and bank
statements of both countries. Please advise me if you prefer me to focus
in one country, or if you need further details of both.

Regarding the Bank reference letter, I have not ordered it yet.
I can order it from:
- My personal bank in Spain, more than 7 years with them. 
- My personal bank in Colombia, only 8 months old.
- My company's BBVA Corporate bank account in London. Account was closed
in December.

Let me know what to do.


Thanks a lot. Regards,


Manuel.
