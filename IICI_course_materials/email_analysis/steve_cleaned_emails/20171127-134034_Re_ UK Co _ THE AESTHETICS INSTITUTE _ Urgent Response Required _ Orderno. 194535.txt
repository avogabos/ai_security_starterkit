Hi Steve

Thanks for your advice.

Unfortunately, at this point we will not be progressing with the business.  Can you send me a refund please as no action will need to be taken on your side.

Let me know what details you need.

Kind regards
Shanti

All training programmes will be CPD accredited with appropriate bodies so will be at an adequate level required to allow for these healthcare professionals to become aesthetic practitioners as allowable by their official registration bodies such the General Medical Council etc.. We can only demonstrate this after the company is formed though so it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation as the training modules will need to be CPD accredited and run via the company (hence the name is of urgency).

Hi Steve
We will be a company carrying out training to eligible
healthcare professionals including doctors, pharmacists, nurses and paramedics.
 All training programmes will be CPD accredited with appropriate bodies so
will be at an adequate level required to allow for these healthcare
professionals to become aesthetic practitioners as allowable by their official
registration bodies such the General Medical Council etc.. We can only
demonstrate this after the company is formed though so it's a bit of a chicken
and egg situation as the training modules will need to be CPD accredited and
run via the company (hence the name is of urgency).
When you say that we need to demonstrate a need for the
institute, what do you imply?
Kind regards
Shanti
