Dear Steve,

My name is Simonetta Stabile. I work for A.Distribution. We have
opened our Uk company with your company. Company number is 9780754 and
Register number is 520945.

I try to contact you many times, but you are always busy. I can
understand, but I need some informations about our contract urgently.
First of all I need to know our Company Registered Address. In
addition I would like to know which kind of service we pay for. I
tried to call you three times today and yesterday. I know  that your
company has an office in Harley Street. Can we meet face to face or
not? In addition, I would like to know if we can speak in Italian or
not, because I want be sure to understand everything. If It is not
possible, please you should have patience with my English.

Thank you in advance

Best Regards

Simonetta Stabile
General Manager
