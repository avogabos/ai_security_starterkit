Are there other banks that you can open the account with as I was hoping to

Dear Customer

Sorry for the delay.

 

Opening offshore bank account is very difficult nowadays. There are imposing
strict rules and due diligence for opening an offshore bank account

They are doing their research in every way to prevent 

- Money laundering issues
- bank accounts used for suspicious activities



We will get back to you as soon as we have any new update from the bank

 

 

Regards

 

Steve
