We received the confirmation from the client and Accounts have been e-filed.
We are awaiting the UTR for CT600 submission.

Dear Accounting Support Team

FORMATIONS HOUSE

 

Regarding FORZEN YOGURT accounts and tax return filing.

 

Did you guys received any response from client because I have not..

 

I think we should file the documents without client confirmation because
today was the last day.

 

Please go ahead..
