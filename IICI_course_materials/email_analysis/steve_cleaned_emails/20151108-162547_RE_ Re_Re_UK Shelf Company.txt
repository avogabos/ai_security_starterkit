It’s a little more complicated if they want VAT too

The reasons are:

1.       The apply for VAT the uk nominee should not have conflicting VAT registered companies, meaning we have to use a very specific nominee

2.       The nominee is then responsible for maintaining VAT compliance, the fines and penalties are strong in the VAT and we would have to constantly ensure no opportunity for VAT fraud also

3.       The VAT accounting is quarterly and must be done

4.       Obtaining a VAT number can take 12 weeks in some cases

 

For these reasons the cost of providing a managed service will be significantly higher 

 

We provide managed services to a range of companies, and have done for more than 12 years. The nature of a managed service is for anonymity so providing references is tricky, however you are provided with a Trust document and a copy of the directors passport if required. We tend to use a small group of Nominees of whom we have long standing relationships with. The nominees are not provided with any access to the banking, and all administration of the company and accounts is handled directly by us in the London office. 

 

Once a nominee is selected, you will see they usually have a handful of other companies which clearly are all different businesses. Some clients have utilised the managed service for over 6 years.

 

The managed service fee for a company with its own trading bank account and VAT is £12,000 per annum which includes all filings etc and no restriction on forwarding revenues so long as we have the compliance documents.

 

This fee is in addition to the cost of the company if purchasing a readymade company with bank account.

Hi Charlotte

 

Need your advice on following client’s query…

 

 

-------------

 

 

Weâ€™re very much still interested in your services, your Managed Company Services sounds particularly interesting, providing our legal team is happy with the contracts. It would appear such a setup would require a considerably amount of trust from both parties, are you able to provide a little more information on how long you have been in business, and any references from other clients?

Weâ€™d be more than happy to provide extensive information on our business model, Iâ€™ll have some documentation prepared for you. In brief, we have a first-to-market approach for a new form of mobile billing technology called â€˜Direct Operator Billingâ€™ throughmobile apps we create and distribute. Due to the nature of this model, we benefit greatly from forming new entities for each new market we enter, making competitive analysis by our competitors more difficult. Â

 

 

For the sake of simplicity I think we’d prefer to use your Managed Service with Nominees then, as in the past we’ve found the process of changing over signatories to be very slow and cumbersome, and for due diligence from Payment Processors we’d benefit from a UK resident. (we work closely with http://www.dimoco.at where most payments will be coming from). That said, if you’d be more confortable meeting myself or my business partner in person first, a trip to London won’t be a problem.

 

Either "INTERPATH LTD” or “UKPR” would be suitable names, we’ll need a VAT number setup and the 50GBP fee for this would be fine. You cited a ‘MTS’ however I don’t believe this will be suitablein our case as our partners/clients have very strict due diligence.

 

In terms of AR/AP we work with only 2 companies here (who process our payments of end-users), so will expect only 1-2 payments monthly, always on the 15th of each month, and would like to send the majority of this revenue onto our offshore Princapal once a month so our books are extremely simple (we currently use this structure in Ireland: http://screencast.com/t/wXdwoDYqHKB ). Are there any additoional fees associated with this?
