To whom it may concern,

We are looking to purchase a company with existing trading history. We
wanted to know what available options you have on offer and the approximate
total costs for acquiring such a company. Essentially we are looking for a
company that has at least a couple of years of trading history and that has
existing credit facilities. 

Regards,
