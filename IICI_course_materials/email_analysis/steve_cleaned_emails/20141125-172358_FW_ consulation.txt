No, the assets act as a guarantee for the funds held in the bank. They are locked away and not part of the general balance of the banks own account

Hi Majid

 

This will happen after the licence is issued, but as part of the application will have to show ability (that you actually have the assets available).

Dear Majid

You have to put assets into the bank name, whether these are cash then held by a guarantor bank or share assets etc you have to put in the name of the bank.

Dear Oliver

 

I hope you are well, thanks for your information about London CSF. We are going to establish a bank in Gambia and wants to make agreement with you in which its license be from there and be renewed every year and provide its software system and its website. We want to provide bank services according to London CSF services and “Science Development Commercial Bank “, is the proposed name of our bank. All three members of the Board of Directors, have 10 years experience in management and commercial and we are now resident in Iran and soon we will announce non-Iranian nationality.

Since the UAE is a country where there is no tax on it and is a free zone country, license for tax cannot be presented. So about this paragraph “minimum of $500,000 in cash or liquid assets”, license of a general trading or legal advisor company in the UAE is acceptable?

 

 

Best regards 

Majid Azizpour
