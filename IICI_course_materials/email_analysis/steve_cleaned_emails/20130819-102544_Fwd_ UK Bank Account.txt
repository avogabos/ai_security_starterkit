Hi Charlotte/Steve

Could someone get back to me regarding the status of the UK bank account
and VAT registration.

This is getting urgent now.
Thanks
Chris

Hi Charlotte

Thanks for your time the other day, we both found it very useful.

Do you have any update regarding the UK Bank Account/VAT registration.

We have a current client that is being billed from another company and we
are very keen to move them over to ACS,

So we really need everything setup in order for this to happen.

I should also be hand delivering Anthony''s bank forms this afternoon.

Thanks
Chris
