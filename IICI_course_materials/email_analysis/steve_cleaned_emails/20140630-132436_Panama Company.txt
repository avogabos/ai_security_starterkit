Dear Mr. Smith

Thank you for your interest in our services.
Our company is a highly experienced and reputable Canadian federal
corporation, member of the Better Business Bureau, member of the Canadian
Federation of Independent Business and an official Corporate Search House
registered with Industry Canada. Please read about our company at
http://www.apintertrust.com/our_company.htm

It was a pleasure to speak with you over the phone earlier. As per our
phone conversation we can assist you with forming either a new Panama
Company or purchasing a Panama shelf company. For your convenience I have
included additional information below about our Panama packages. I will
also send you a separate e-mail with other services we offer which may be
of interest to you.

All our incorporation fees listed below are in US Dollars and include
Panama registered office address, Panama registered agent, and Panama
government fee for the first year.

We offer two convenient Panama packages to fit your business needs.

1) Panama IBC costs $1,100.
If you are planning to get a Panama company and open a corporate bank
account by yourself, this package is for you.
The package includes all documents required for opening a corporate bank
account with most international banks.

2) Panama IBC Package costs $1,690.
If you would like to get a Panama company, legalization of corporate
documents with Apostille, a corporate seal, and our bank introduction
services for opening a corporate bank account, this package is for you.
You may select one of the banks located in Singapore, St. Vincent, Latvia,
Seychelles, Belize or Nevis.
The package is recommended if you do not have established relationships
with an international bank, and would like to get our assistance with
opening a bank account.
Please read detailed information about the packages at
http://www.apintertrust.com/offshore_company/panama_ibc_packages.htm

Please note that in order to incorporate a company in Panama a minimum of 3
directors is required in order to incorporate a company. Nominee services
are available for an additional fee and may be added in the order form.

Everyone listed in the order is required to submit all due diligence
documents on our website at:
http://www.apintertrust.com/know_your_client.htm

It usually takes 1 business day to incorporate a Panama company and 6 to 9
business days to prepare all corporate documents and legalize them with
Apostille.

Shelf (already incorporated) companies are available immediately, but they
cost more. Please request a price before placing your order.
Our list of shelf companies is published at
http://www.apintertrust.com/offshore_company/shelf_company_list.htm

The annual renewal fee for Panamanian companies is $800.
It is payable from the second year.
Please read information about the annual fee at
http://www.apintertrust.com/help/annual_fees_details.htm

We also form Panama Foundations. You may read more at:
http://www.apintertrust.com/offshore_company/panama_foundation_packages.htm

Our company process orders in accordance with the Order Processing
Procedure published at
http://www.apintertrust.com/order_processing_procedure_international.htm

If you need any additional information, please let us know.


*Please note that our office is closed Tuesday July 1, 2014 for the Canada
Day Holiday. Our office will re-open Wednesday July 2,2014 at 9 am ET.*

Thank you.
