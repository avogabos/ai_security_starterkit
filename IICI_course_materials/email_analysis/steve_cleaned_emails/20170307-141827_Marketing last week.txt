Dear Team

 

Last week we had even more traffic - great news but we need to convert into
sales. 

 

Please update me with how many email you sent last week with each of the
offers, and if not done yet explain what you will do this week to try and
increase sales from agents and customers etc

 

Some offers would only be relevant to agents, and its important to maintain
strong contact with agents to ensure we are getting all the business we can
from them

Signing up new agents is the next big push

Having marketing databases never work, its always a case of picking a
location, and then googling every accountant there and emailing them an
introduction to Formations House, and letting them know what we do.

If you need an email template for this please let me know.

 

In the next week or so we will also be doing a push for specific accounting
services to tie in with fiscal years ends for corporate and directors (as
most UK directors must file Self Assessments now). There is a specific
budget for this marketing and I hope that the budget is well spent and we
see an increase in sales.

 

Comms will be go this week.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
