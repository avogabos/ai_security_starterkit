Dear Gian

 

I've just arrived back from Italy today, I will get Steve to update you
about the 2nd  Delaware company as I still think this must outstanding.

 

Steve when you start work today, could you please update Mr Rundini about
the formations of these Delaware companies, so that LLP companies can also
be incorporated this week?

 

Regards, Tahir

establishment of two companies of Delaware and two other London-based.
Expecting a report on the meeting and the situation of the constitution of
the society, but to date I have not received anything.
Please keep me informed about the situation.
