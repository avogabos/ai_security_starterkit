Thanks Steve for the great reply!

3 questions:

I am a UK citizen without a USA passport or green card, i only have a temporary visa to work in the fashion industry here and have to practice my MrHealth.com <http://mrhealth.com/> outside the USA. I am classed as an alien resident here as i pay tax here and live here 6 months of the year. Can i not open the bank account on the basis of me being a UK citizen?

I am not interested in registering in the UK, just offshore. What are the different prices for your off-shore locations above, also is there a minimum payment into my bank account to hold the company in each respective country?
I am interested in BVI as it is only 4hrs flight from New York if ever needed to visit.

If I can’t use one of your banks can i send my money from this new business into my UK account without any duties to UK authorities (I will still be paying global income tax to the USA) and connect that to my off-shore registration instead. I already have the UK account.

Thanks Martin

Hi Oliver!
Following our telephone conversation today (thursday mid afternoon) I am detailing my requirements to register my new company:
1) LLC as i am the only employee at the moment. I live mostly in New York working on a visa in a different industry but i can have a business online based outside the USA if I declare income to my global U.S. tax payment. I am launching my health website ‘
MrHealth.com
’.
2) Interested in The Gambia but please suggest otherwise if you have another alternative.
3) My company will be providing an online personal training service, blog, e-commerce suite selling affiliate and eventually my own health products e.g. training eqpt, supplements, clothing, sustainable products.
4) I need to trademark my domain name and logo. Do I need to register two names (
MrHealth.com
but also an umbrella company name - say, ‘ThehealthRevolution Ltd’? - under which other companies can be formed e.g..
MrsHealth.com
?)
5) I require a bank account and card to receive global payments.
6) A virtual office is required in London with telephone forwarding/answering/mail forwarding.
7) What extra costs shall i expect, are there any payments/registration necessary to UK authorities?
8) Any other info you think i may want to know to avoid surprises/difficulties in the future..?
9) I have passport copy and address proof/bills etc at my apartment here in NY.
Thanks Oliver! I hope to call you tomorrow and register the company.
