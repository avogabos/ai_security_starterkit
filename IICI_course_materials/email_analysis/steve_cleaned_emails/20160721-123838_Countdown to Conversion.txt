Steve... here are two+ very important dates for your company diary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear SteveKeeping you fully up to date about the Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements
of the Companies Act 2014

In this month's Ezine I'd like to draw your attention to not one but...
...two+ very important company legal administration dates in 2016.

Could I urge you to mark both of these dates in your diary now,  immediately, while
they are both fresh in your mind.

You see, both of these dates relate to an important decision that affects just about
ALL existing Irish registered private companies that are limited by shares.

* Your first date for your diary is the 31st August of this year
- which is closer than you might think.

* Your second date for your diary is three months later, on the 30th November of
 this year, and this is a deadline date which Companies Registration Office (CRO)
in Ireland has warned everyone not to overlook!

So important are these two dates in relation to your Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements of the Companies Act 2014,
that I'd added an extra calendar page below for your consideration.

My reason for including this extra call-to-action calendar page is because some 
days ago Companies Registration Office (CRO) in Ireland warned that as we get closer
to the  30th November 2016 deadline the expectation is that there will be a gigantic
upsurge in the number of applications being submitted for processing - so much so
that CRO may not be able to process all of them in time to beat the cut-off deadline
of the 30th November.

Whatever you do, don't let this happen to you or to any limited company that you
have a responsibility for... or an interest in.

With such important changes happening this year, I'd particularly like you to know
that you are very welcome to call either myself or my colleague, Sue Jesper, on 
01 664 1111 or email Sue on sue@formations.ie [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001nd3pxn8bWBgkY4luFD0O_4kIDxDlcqIklyTpxwKJ-_xnAQi3iB76zCpXQbnyexT5uB-Aut06YzUJeIYm89NRDk3GnCRyO9eRWlz7Hqi-yYbkPP0JNJfW62RoXbSgug1tvy8RdNs0n41DTTIzRyMw58dXGveEqi3Mob-ZCCP5k4I=&c=Q1QHBOcRhGEoNzvG0Oph2F9BsEXaDBTo0U2fP8-G5mgtkN79mBBjvQ==&ch=Nyd4LVROtb96KIpggmKXiMddiOlC1Fd8-yx-T3c4EGE4OPAXX7LAqg==]and we'll give you all the help and advice you need.

Yours sincerely,

A brief summary of what is happening + a very useful Fact Sheet for you
With the introduction of the Companies Act 2014 on 1st June 2015, all existing private
companies limited by shares, have to decide whether they wish to be a DAC or opt
 in to being the new simplified LTD.

If no choice has been made by a company as of 30th November 2016, they will automatically
be converted to an LTD.  However, failure to take action prior to this date may 
result in a corporate form that is unsuitable for the business of your company, 
and indeed may be deemed as a breach of the Directors' duties.

In order to help you decide on the best option for your company, we have put together
a fact sheet on the conversion process, together with a snapshot of the main differences
between a DAC and an LTD.  We can also provide you with guidance and paperwork in
order to convert to your desired company type in advance of the deadlines.
Click here to view our Fact Sheet

With conversion packages to LTD from as little as ?189* + vat per company (*Discounts
for multiple companies are available)  it makes excellent economic sense for you
 to contact us to see how we can help with a cost effective and efficient solution
for all your conversion needs.

NOW
is perhaps the best time of all for you to attend to the necessary secretarial work
to convert your company.

If a company is making an application to be restored within twelve months of being
struck off or dissolved it can apply directly to the Companies Registration Office.
This will avoid the necessity of engaging a solicitor and barrister and seeking 
a hearing in the High Court.

Company Formations International Limited | 22 Northumberland Road | Ballsbridge | Dublin | 4 | IrelandIreland's Company Formation & Company Secretarial Specialists
Dear Steve,
Just twelve short months ago the Companies Act 2014 was the new kid on the block and the end of the transition period, for existing private limited by shares companies to convert to either the new form LTD or the DAC model, seemed like a lifetime away.
But we are now just
41 days
away from the deadline to pass your resolutions to become a
DAC!
Whilst most companies will be best suited to the new LTD model, there are still a number of companies who must convert to DACs under statute, or for whom the DAC model simply suits better. These companies must pass their resolutions no later than
31st August 2016
and it's important to note that under section 198 of the Companies Act 2014
a resolution is required to be filed, within 15 days of having been passed.
It's interesting to note that whilst the numbers of companies converting to DAC are small in comparison to those converting to LTD, two-thirds of the applications filed have been lodged since January this year and a final surge of applications is expected to hit the CRO in the coming weeks.
Whilst the time line for converting to the new
LTD
model is a more generous
132 days
away, the advice from the CRO is that due to the volume of applications being received (currently in excess of 13,000), they recommend forms are filed no later than the end of October in order to ensure they are processed prior to the end of the transition period on 31st November... so that's 31 days less than we thought we had!
In order to help you decide on the best option(s) for companies under your care and to explain the process in more detail, we have put together a comprehensive factsheet on the procedure and a snapshot of the differences between the two new private limited company types. With conversion packages from as little as €189* + vat per company, we can provide you with cost effective and efficient service and a friendly guide through the process.
* Discounts for multiple companies are available
With the peak season for the filing of annual returns rapidly approaching, combined with impending tax return deadlines,
NOW
would be a the ideal time to deal with this issue.
Why not click here to download our easy to read
Fact Sheet
and
Guide
or call one of our "Conversion Team" Sue, Karen, Stephanie or Sean today on 01 - 664 11 11 to talk through the options available.
Yours sincerely,
