Hello
Steve
We
are very disappointed with this situation! As you can  see in the email
below that the EPB sent me, they haven't received the documents. Please tell me
what's happening? Why Formations House haven't send the documents to the bank?
Please send me the documents...I need you to help me finish my two companies
process...Please!!!

Hi Angela
To confirm I
have still yet receive the corporate documents from Formation House, could you
please ask them to send them through.  Also regarding the bank statements
they are not CREDIT CARD statements are they?  As mentioned before the
bank does not accept CREDIT CARD statements.
Thank you,
Regards,
Wade Lambert
