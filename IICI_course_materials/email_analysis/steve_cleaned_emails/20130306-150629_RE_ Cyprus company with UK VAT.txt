It is dependent upon what is being supplied and where the invoicing is
raised from and being delivered to. In most cases it is charged at 17% in
Cyprus, but if the goods are coming from UK and going to UK then they should
charge 20%

Hi

 

 

Customer needs a Cyprus company, most of their services will be to companies
in the UK, how would they handle the VAT charge on their sales invoices.
