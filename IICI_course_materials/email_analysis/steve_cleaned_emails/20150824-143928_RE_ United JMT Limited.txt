We did had
problems in processing bank accounts for our Syrian national clients therefore
we are not offering bank account service to Syrian nationals. But for company formation

We have
forwarded your given information to Seychelles and we will update you as soon
as we have an update.

 

Regards

 

Steve

  Mr. Steve   / Jaohar

Good day,

 

Actually for this reason we asked your goodself if there will be
any problem for Syrian national.

 

However, please note Syria is a high risk country due to war
going on, however I am myself a Syrian resident in Sweden,

graduated from the UK Liverpool John Moores University. Worked
in many places around the world but in in Syria even in the safest time.

 

Meantime, we do not have any bank reference, the bank statement
you already have, we can provide you with general details of our bank in
Sweden, however they will not provide you with any info about the clients for
sure.

 

For professional reference, we can provide you with the below in
Sweden, we have plenty of references world wide but I hope the below is enough
for starting the company and have the documents at earliest.

 

Onexes Maritime Services, Sorbyplan 14, SE-163 71 Spanga, Sweden.

Capt M. Fkhir, owner/ managing director of
company: +46723333418.

 

I hope the above are enough for starting the
company.

 

Best regards

A Jaohar
