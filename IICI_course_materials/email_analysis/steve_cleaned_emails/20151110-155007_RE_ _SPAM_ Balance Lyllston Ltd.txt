Dear Sir,

 

Thank you for your mail regarding Annual Account for our company LYLLSTON
LIMITED for the accounting period ended 28th February 2015.

I do approve over the accounts so you may proceed with e-filing of the same
with Companies House.

 

Can you inform us the way to pay the Corporative Tax, (87£) to Companies
House ?

And also tell us when you filled the CT600 Form.

Thank you for your attention,

 

Best regards,

 

Eric Gilly
