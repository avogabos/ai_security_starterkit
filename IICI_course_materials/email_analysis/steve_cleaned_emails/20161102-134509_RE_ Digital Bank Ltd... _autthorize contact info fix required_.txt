Hi

VALID ID Documents for Ng Kok Kiong are required because you are main authorize contact person for all your orders and since UK laws have changed we are now required to maintain valid id documents for authorize contact person as well as appointed company director/s and shareholder/s. Therefore AI LTD and DIGITAL BANK LTD we will need valid id documents of Ng Kok Kiong.

Please send these as soon as possible.

I will arrange invoice for Digital Bank LTD with additional services later today.

Regards,

Steve...
