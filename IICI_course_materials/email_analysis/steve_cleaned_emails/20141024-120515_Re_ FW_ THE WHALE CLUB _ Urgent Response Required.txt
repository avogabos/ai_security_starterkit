Steve,

Thank you for your assistance with this.  On the Memorandum of 
Association, I was wondering if you knew which field the "Subscriber" 
was pulling from: Director, Secretary or Shareholder? I need to check a 
few things here but at some point I may want to change the Subscriber 
from my personal name to the USA company name and would like to know how 
to do that.

Again, thank you for your assistance,

Mark
