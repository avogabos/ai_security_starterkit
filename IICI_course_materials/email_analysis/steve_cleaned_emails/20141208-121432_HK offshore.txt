Good Morning,

Could you send me an up-to-date registration form for HK and whole docs,
please.
I have few questions, which I would like to consult with you first. I would
appreciate your fast reply:
The company:
1. How to draw the money from the company in a legal way? Any documents?
Or do I simply go to the bank and withdraw the money without any questions?
What happens if I spend or lose the withdrawn cash? Should documents
reflect that?
Will there be any questions about the spent/lost money from the HK company?
Let’s say I took money for an invoice, e.g. for distribution of leaflets,
and the same situation happens (I lose it or spend it) – what then? I would
like to know what happens with taxes in such cases when the money is
withdrawn and spent, but it is not my wage.
2. Is there definitely no other costs except from the preliminary fee and
the renewal of the license after a year? I understand that the fee covers
the cost of setting the business, opening the bank account and the annual
service. After a year I pay 595 GBP for the renewal and that is the only
cost. Is that correct?
3. Since I do not pay any taxes in HK, I could, theoretically, issue the
invoices around to anyone, couldn’t I?
It seems that the HK company does not need any costs, since there is no
taxes to be paid.

The matter of the bank is really important to me and I am not sure how to
verify it:

4. What is the cost of international bank transfers?
5. Is there any limit on cash withdrawals/internet payments?
6. Is there any fees for card payments outside HK?
7. In which currencies can I have my account? Is there any fee for issuing
the card or account maintenance?
8. Is it possible for the HK company to have an account in UK as well? Can
you help with that? Is it possible to open it via internet or is a
representative necessary?
9. Can I have a nominee service in HK? If yes, what would be the cos of it
(set up/annual fees)?
10. Regarding the functioning of the company, what is my position? Should I
hold any particular post or am I just an attorney to handle all matters
including the money withdrawal?

Thank you in advance for your feedback.
