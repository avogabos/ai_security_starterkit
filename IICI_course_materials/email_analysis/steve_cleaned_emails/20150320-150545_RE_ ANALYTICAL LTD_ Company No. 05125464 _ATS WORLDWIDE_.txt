Hi Delphine and Steve,
 
At the beginning of the year you helped me to finalise the purchase and set up of the above established company. I have just had someone come back to me stating that according to Companies House there are no appointed directors at the moment for the company!? 
 
The other point is that the records also show my personal home address as having been a registered office, which was stated initially as this would not occur. Further to this the previous address shows as being from www.buy-this-company-name.com. This should only show the 29 Harley Street aspect not the company description. Can you please get them to amend the records immediately to remove my home address as well as this description!?
 
Many thanks,
 
James

Hi Delphine,
 
I hope you had a good 
break..
 
Thank you very much for these. So just to confirm, I 
need to sign them and send them to Companies House for them to lodge? Do I 
need to provide any specific instruction for them to complete 
this?
 
Kind regards,
 
James
