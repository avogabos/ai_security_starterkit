Dear
Praveen
Reddy and
Karin Bergmann
Thank you for sending the documents which are being reviewed by
our due diligence team.
Meanwhile I like to inform you that, you have choose Director
Privacy Service GBP 150 (per annum), service hides director/s address in public
records. Since both director/s are also shareholders then you will also need
Shareholder Protection Service GBP 150 (per annum). Whether company director
and shareholder are the same entity or different entity, company registrar
consider director and shareholder as two separate entities.
Therefore Director Privacy Service
will not have an effect on Shareholders information and their address will be
visible in public records.
Please
advice if you wish to add Shareholder Privacy Service GBP 150 to your order?
For SIC
code please see attach file.
And provide
PSC information with SIC code as both information should be submitted together.
If you
require further information or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone
or by live chat on our website.
