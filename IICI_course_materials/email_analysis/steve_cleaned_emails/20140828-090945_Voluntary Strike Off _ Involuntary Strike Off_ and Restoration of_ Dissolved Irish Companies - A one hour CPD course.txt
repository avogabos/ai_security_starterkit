Do you need a Company Secretary for an Irish registered company?
Dear Steve,
A 
                              while back I got together with Diarmuid O'Donovan, 
                              the founder of the excellent CPDWise website and 
                              together we created a 1 hour online course entitled 
                              '
Introduction 
                              to Company Secretarial Practice.
'
This 
                              proved to be quite a success at that time and indeed 
                              this course consistently ranks in the top five courses 
                              on Diarmuid's site each year. Users like the jargon 
                              free and pragmatic approach adopted AND the auto-generated 
                              CPD certificate at the end.
Following 
                              on from this, Diarmuid and I decided to look at 
                              the more specific topics of...
-
Voluntary 
                                    Strike Off
-
In-Voluntary 
                                    Strike Off
-
Restoration 
                                    of Dissolved Companies
With
thousands
of companies being struck off each 
                              year, this course will be of great interest to:
-
Accountants
-
Solicitors
-
Tax 
                                    Professionals
-
Company 
                                    Directors
-
Apartment 
                                    owners/Property Managers
So 
                              why not visit the
course 
                              description page
to watch my video introducing 
                              our course and to see a detailed list of the issues 
                              covered. I think you will be impressed.
As 
                              an introductory offer and for a limited time only, 
                              Diarmuid has reduced the cost of the course from 
                              €37 to €27 saving you €10.
This 
                              is great value considering the relevant content 
                              and the ability to complete it
online
and
at any time 24/7
, without having 
                              to leave your home or office.
Please 
                              do try this course (
