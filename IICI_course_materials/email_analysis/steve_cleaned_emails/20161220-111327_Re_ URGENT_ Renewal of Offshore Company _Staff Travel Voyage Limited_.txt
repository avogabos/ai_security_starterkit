Hi Steve

Is all complete re below now so that I can make amends to the
shareholders/directors per your previous?:

*Once above services are renewed then you can login to your account and use
online company administrator to generate resolutions for appointment of new
director and shareholder. You need to download these resolutions, print,
sign and send it to us by email, which then will be forwarded to Seychelles
registry for processing.*



*------------*

*Regards,*


* Steve Smith*

FYI Steve, the new shareholder will be in the form of a BVI company, can
you advise what info you require for this?

Best regards
Phil
