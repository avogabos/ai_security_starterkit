Dear Customer,

We apologize for the delay, please note that you have made some changes
with the company share structure and it seems these forms have not been yet
submitted to Seychelles registry and therefore their records are not
updated and hence this took so long.

We are preparing the share transfer forms and share certificates for you to
sign and email us back the copies and we shall forward this to registry so
that they can make changes and provide us with the updated draft of
incumbency which will be then email to you for approval.
