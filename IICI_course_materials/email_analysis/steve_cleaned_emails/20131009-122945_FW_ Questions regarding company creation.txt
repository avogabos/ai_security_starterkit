Dear Oliver,

we talked this morning in the online chat.

I've been planning to open a UK Ltd. for some time, but the plans got
delayed several times for various reasons. But now things are moving
forward, so I looked on your website again.

There I discovered the Global Company, but I am not sure it is a good choice
for me. Is it visible to European customers that the company is registered
in Gambia? And do you really NOT need to submit an annual tax declaration
for this type of company?

I also saw that apparently your products on the 2nd page for the UK Limited
have changed a bit. I'd be the Director, and my wife would be the Secretary.
I know I would need the Value Accounting so you do my annual tax
declaration, the Online Company Administrator, the Registered Address, and
maybe the Company Protection Service and the Directors Privacy Service. I
would also order the Web Hosting package with the emails.

But the one thing I don't understand is that on page one of the process, it
says that the price for registering the UK company is £50. On page 2, I can
select the Company Formation (Limited by Guarantee) for £150. I remember
that the last time I checked, the company formation cost £99. I am a bit
confused as to what I need. Have you reduced the price of the standard
company creation? And if I see this correctly, what is the advantage of the
Limited by Guarantee item? And if I don't select this, is then the company
created for £50 and it is limited by shares?

I know I've asked your colleague a couple of questions some time ago
already, so apologies for asking again, I just want to be sure to select the
right items.

Thanks for letting me know.

Kind regards

Joachim Trensz
