Dear Sir

Re - Markled Limited - 7232312

Companies House will require the following documents, with regards to Administrative Restoration:-

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration.aspx<http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration.aspx>

3)  Annual Return form for the year ending 22nd April 2012, with the filing fee of £40..

4)  Accounts for the period ending 30th April 2012.

Having checked our records, as the above company was struck of the Register, prior to filing the Accounts for 2012, no late filing penalty would been generated, upon its Restoration.

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.

Restoration Department.
