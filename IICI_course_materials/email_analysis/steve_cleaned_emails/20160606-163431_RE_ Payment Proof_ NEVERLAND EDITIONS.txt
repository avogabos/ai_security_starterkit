Hello Steve,

 

I just did as promised the bank transfer payment for the 325£ for the Registered Address and the Virtual office Infinity Mail. AND i’ve added as i told you on phone 30£ to be put in Neverland Editions « wallet » to pay for the mail shipping of the letters, so i’ve sent in fact 355£ ( see PDF of the bank confirmation below ). I’ve added the 30£ because i can’t put money in the wallet directly from my Mac on your site, it just doesn’t work.

 

Thanks to add these 30£ in the wallet and to ask for the forward of all letters which are waiting for at the usual address that you have for me in Paris.

 

Best wishes,

 

Alain Littaye

Neverland Editions
