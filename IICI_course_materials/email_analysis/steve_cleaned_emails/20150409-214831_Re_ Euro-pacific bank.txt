Hi Steve

I've completed the steps on formationshouse.com that you have outlined 
for me in your email below. We ordered the Apostille, the Certificate of 
Incumbency and the Off-Shore bank account (euro pacific) at once, total 
paid 920 for the 3 items which was sent by wire transfer. Please see 
the attached proof of payment.

We need to know from you about the next steps. What do you need from us 
next to complete the Euro-Pacific bank account setup for Inforbis Ltd?

Thank you.

this is their options for investment management after.
              Once account is opened
              you can then directly communicate with bank for this

Re: Euro-pacific bank
Hi Steve
Thanks for the feedback.
My partners and I trade and broker IT equipment
                (hardware and software)
                globally. We operate two companies for this business.
                Since we are physically
                in South Africa, we have a South African registered
                company whose sole purpose
                is to provide this brokering service to our UK
                registered Inforbis Ltd. In
                other words, my partners and I close deals from Cape
                Town, South Africa. The
                details of the deal are then passed on to our UK company
                to be fully processed
                and handled. The UK company then pays a commission fee
                to the South African
                company for finding the deal.
The Euro-Pacific bank account is needed for the UK
                registered Inforbis Ltd
                strictly for paying suppliers, receiving money from
                customers, and paying
                commission to us in South Africa, as well as paying any
                other related operating
                costs.
Gradually, profits from deals will accumulate in the
                Euro-Pacific bank account.
                We are very interested in exploring investment
                opportunities offered by
                Euro-Pacific.
If there are any other questions in regards to our
                business activites, please
                don't hesitate to ask.

Re: Euro-pacific bank
Hi Steve
The total cost is more than £500
                    for us since there are
                    Apostille documents, etc. that we need prepared by
                    you and as a start-up, it all
                    adds up, but that's all manageable. We just want to
                    know what the chances of
                    success are so I would really appreciate an answer
                    the following questions from
                    my last email.
We realise that the decision is the bank's in the
                    end, but what is your total track
                    record of successful applications at Euro-Pacific
                    bank? What is your track
                    record of successful applications for citizens of
                    South Africa at Euro-Pacific
                    bank, if there have been such applications in the
                    past?
Thank you Steven.

Euro-pacific bank
Hi Steve
My partners and I want to proceed with opening a bank
                  account at Euro-Pacific
                  Bank. Since the total fees for this service are quite
                  significant, we'd like to
                  ask a few more questions.
One of the requirements was that we have CVs ready.
                  How comprehensive must this
                  CV be? What does the bank need our CVs for? How many
                  years prior to today
                  should the CV account for, if not full
                  history/lifelong CV? We'd like to know
                  in order to complete the best possible version.
When it is time for the skype interview with the
                  Euro-Pacific bank, will you
                  prepare us for it? What kind of questions should we
                  expect?
What is your total track record of successful
                  applications at Euro-Pacific
                  bank? What is your track record of successful
                  applications for citizens of
                  South Africa at Euro-Pacific bank?
Please reply to all cc'd addresses, those are my
                  partners. Thank you.
