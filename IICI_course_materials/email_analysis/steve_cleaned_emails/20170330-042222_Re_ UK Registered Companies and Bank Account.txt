Dear Steve,

Thanks a lot for your email and details provided. I'm interested in Basic
UK Ready Maid Companies specifically with "BIZ TRAIDING LTD" Company No:
08281892. however, it shall come with active bank account at Barclays UK.
VAT Registration is not necessary. Please advise total purchase price with
the active bank account. I assume this will be £2500 all together.


Please also advise if you would be in a position to negotiate the price of
the : *INTERPATH LTD *which is the first one listed below?
