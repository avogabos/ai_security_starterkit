Dear Steve;

Hello, sorry for the delay in replying to your E-mail due the the problems
we have in Libya.
I have advised Mr. Ayoub to proceed closing the company, as the company
has not done any work so far any where so would you please do what's
necessary for closing it.
the company has no return at all as I said it was formed to work in Libya
but man proposes and Gud disposes the entire country is demolished and no
business was conduted.

I thank you very much in advance and look forward to RCVE from you again


Regards


Saied Bazik
