Osborne considers cutting CGT

The Times reports that George Osborne is considering cutting CGT as a way of encouraging people to sell their second homes. Treasury officials have been asked to look at cuts to the top rate from 28% to 20%, while the charge for basic rate taxpayers would drop from 18% to 15%. Another alternative could see the merging of CGT with IHT, although the Times suggests Mr Osborne will not want to undermine the promise made in the autumn statement to abolish IHT for couples with less than £1m of assets. Lord Bilimoria, the crossbench peer, stated: "CGT should be lowered to open up greater wealth creation. The current rate of 28% is far too high, considering that the rate used to be 18% during the last Labour government, when entrepreneurs' relief was far more generous." Elsewhere, the Standard notes that over a third of Londoners are in favour of a tax being introduced on properties in the capital that are left empty for a long period of time.

Budget: What to expect?

The Standard debates what George Osborne will announce in the Budget today. The paper suggests that the Chancellor is set to crack down on tax avoidance by multinationals, with plans to cut tax relief for debt interest payments likely to form one pillar of a so-called business tax roadmap. More measures on tax evasion are also expected as well as plans to digitise HMRC to make it easier for individuals to keep up with their taxes. The paper adds that there could be an announcement on business rates and potentially a rise in fuel duty. Meanwhile, banks will be hoping that the Chancellor opts to leave the bank levy alone, while a potential sale of former Bradford & Bingley mortgages held by UKAR could be announced. Elsewhere, the FT predicts that tax rises are likely to exceed any cuts, while the Telegraph says insurers will be most affected by the Chancellor’s plans to raise the insurance premium tax to 12.5%. Meanwhile, Larry Elliott in the Guardian suggests that a few “modest” tax cuts will be paid for by stealth taxes.

Budget is chance to reform HMRC’s relationship with business

Chris Sanger, head of policy at EY, writes that a particular interest in tomorrow's Budget will be the Business Tax Roadmap, which will outline how companies will be taxed for the remainder of the decade. The roadmap could provide an opportunity to reinvigorate the relationship between HMRC and big business and the government should take this chance to set out clearly what HMRC expects of large businesses and what large businesses should expect of HMRC, he writes.

Buy-to-let attack could worsen housing crisis

Writing in the Telegraph, Conservative peer Lord Flight criticises the Government’s introduction of higher taxes in the buy-to-let sector. He says the policy will not necessarily make it any easier for first-time buyers to get on the ladder, and predicts it could actually lead to a decline in the number of rental properties available. Many smaller-scale landlords who are hit by the additional taxes are the very people Conservatives should be supporting, he adds.

Time to tackle tax avoidance

Simon Bain writes in the Herald that the Chancellor should look at outlawing employee benefit trusts as part of a crackdown on tax avoidance in his Budget. He cites Elaine McInroy, tax specialist at Saffery Champness, who says that we should expect more changes to tackle perceived abuses. She adds that there is a “cultural and political shift occurring and we might expect further alignment of HMRC and the judiciary with public opinion”.

Are tax havens such a problem?

In a blogpost for the Adam Smith Institute, Tim Worstell questions whether tax havens deprive governments of as much revenue as is often claimed. He highlights a recent report by Oxfam which estimates the Treasury is losing around £5bn a year from British “tax-dodgers” holding more than £170bn in tax havens. Mr Worstell calculates that global tax revenues are around $23trn, which means – based on Oxfam’s research – that the value of tax dodging is equivalent to just 1% of government budgets.

Channel Islands tax representatives face EU committee

Representatives from the Channel Islands have faced questioning from MEPs on taxation systems. Guernsey tax director Rob Gray and Jersey international affairs adviser Colin Powell answered questions on tax avoidance and exchange of information. Meanwhile, Jersey chief minister Senator Ian Gorst said it was important to comply with “all relevant information standards”.

Insurance tax hike unfair, says insurer

The chief executive of Hastings has voiced concerns over a likely increase in insurance premium tax, despite the car insurer benefitting from rising insurance taxes. “This is a tax on consumers not on the industry, and it’s a tax on a product that’s compulsory,” said Gary Hoffman.

Messages cost charities millions in tax

The Times reports that charities have been denied millions of pounds after donors wrote personal messages on the JustGiving fundraising website. HMRC instructed staff at JustGiving to remove gift aid where a personal message had been left that referred to more than one person.

Accountants fear financial advice requests

A report by Bower Private Clients has found that accountants are becoming concerned that growing demand for personal finance advice from clients is putting them at risk of exceeding their professional expertise. A survey of 105 accountants found that 36% had seen an increase in demand for financial advice over the past year. Of these, 31% said they are worried some of the advice they are giving goes beyond their core expertise. Almost half, 45%, of the accountants polled believe their work with independent financial advisers will increase over the next 24 months as a result of recent changes to pension rules.

How to get a job at Deloitte

Dan Butcher explains how it is possible to get a job at Deloitte, which only takes on 4% of the roughly 500,000 applications it receives every year for experienced hires. Patty Pogemiller, the national director of talent acquisition and mobility at Deloitte in the US, says one of the ways Deloitte takes on experienced hires is through recommendations from its current group of employees. She also notes that even at graduate level Deloitte looks to take on people who have had exposure to the business. “As early as high school we’re building relationships, and during college we invite students to come to events and interact with recruiters,” she explains. Elsewhere, the Standard profiles Deloitte’s BrightStart scheme, which offers apprentices the chance to learn on the job while earning a salary.

Scott-Moncrieff celebrates Audit Scotland success

Scott-Moncrieff has revealed that it has been named in the recent Audit Scotland external tender. It is the only firm to secure appointments in all four lots. Scott-Moncrieff’s public sector team will work with bodies across Scotland within lots for Central Government, Local Government, the NHS and Further Education, with the specific workloads to be allocated by Audit Scotland over the next month.

Budget: What should SMEs expect?

The Times identifies several announcements that SMEs should be looking out for in today’s Budget. They include reform of business rates, with the FSB calling for a tax relief for the smallest companies to be made permanent. An overhaul of NICs to reduce administrative burdens for employers and simplify the system for workers has also been mooted. And adjustments to entrepreneurs' relief and EIS are also said to be under consideration.

Start-up funding needs to develop

Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal & General, says Britain needs to develop a culture of lending to SMEs, after it emerged more than half of start-ups are funded by credit card. He said the borrowing figure underlines why the UK struggles to turn start-up firms into thriving 'grown up' businesses.

Competitor says peer-to-peer lending heading for meltdown

David Postings, chief executive of Bibby Financial Services, says people lending directly to SMEs through peer-to-peer websites could face heavy losses because the market is “overheating.”

Taking advantage of Isas and tax-free allowances

James Connington in the Telegraph offers a guide on the changes to Isas and tax-free allowances. He looks at Cash Isas, Help to Buy Isas, Stocks and Shares Isas, Innovative Finance Isas, Junior Isas and the rules for withdrawal. Elsewhere, the Mail claims that HMRC is making “huge errors” in calculating savers’ tax liabilities, with some taxpayers being told by the Revenue that it expects them to earn up to six times as much interest this year than they will actually receive.

ECONOMY

 

British bosses’ biggest worry is not Brexit

Bloomberg columnist Lionel Laurent comments that Britain’s chief executives’ biggest worry is not a possible Brexit, but concerns over a potential slowdown in emerging markets. He notes that in terms of revenue, top UK companies are more exposed to emerging markets than they are to Europe. Some 28% of the FTSE 100’s revenues come from emerging markets, compared to 15.5% from the EU. Meanwhile, a survey by PwC suggested that UK CEOs rank China as a greater source of growth than Germany over the next 12 months.
