Ok thanks Oliver. 

Which ID and information would you require from me? I'd like to limit my connection with the company to as little as absolutely possible. There is nothing illegal about what I'm doing, I'd just like to protect the asset as much as possible - legally. 

Could you please advise?

Kindest Regards
Kyle

The bank account opening for Seychelles company will be done either with

 

FBME (Cyprus)

Or

Rietumu (Latvia)

 

We do not offer merchant card processing, after the business bank account is opened 

You can deal with any other provider for merchant processing
