Subject: Certificate of Incumbency, Bank Account

Hello Steve,

I have received the documents.  Thank you.  There was no Certificate of Incumbency with the documents though which is also generally required by the banks:  how can I get one sent to me?
I also have no heard anything back about the appointment with the bank in Singapore for next week.   
As its too close to the date now it will need to be pushed back to week of April 5th.
I can't remind you again how important this is as I'm having to use personal funds for my business expenses without a bank account, and we're working on this since December last year.  As I'm paying extra for this service I find this not very acceptable.

Kind Regards,

Reto
