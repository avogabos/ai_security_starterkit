Hello steve

I have a company based in uk for which I need a bank account + merchant account for web hosting, web development services.

Can you provide assistance for creation of bank account + merchant account services.

I am sole shareholder and a non uk resident.

I can consider offshore account also.

Plz suggest and revert back with costing.

Regards
