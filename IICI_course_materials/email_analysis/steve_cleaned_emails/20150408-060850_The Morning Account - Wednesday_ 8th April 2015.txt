TAX

Labour will scrap non-dom tax status
Ed Miliband is to announce plans to abolish the non-domiciled tax rule. In a speech in Coventry, Mr Miliband will say non-dom status is being wrongly used to avoid paying UK taxes and that some who have lived abroad and return to Britain qualify for the status on the basis of little more than an overseas newspaper subscription, a burial plot abroad and a foreign bank account. The move could further alienate Labour from the business and finance community who are concerned about Labour plans to reintroduce the 50p tax rate and introduce a mansion tax. Mr Miliband will say: "There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain like you and me, are permanently settled here in Britain like you and me, but aren't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200-year-old loophole. There are now 116,000 non-doms, costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country. It can no longer be justified.” There will however be exceptions for students and those working in Britain temporarily. Mr Miliband’s announcement comes as 30 more UK business leaders sign a letter declaring their support for Tory-led economic policies.

Mansion tax could tilt the balance in London
Research from Savills has suggested that the mansion tax could tilt the balance in marginal seats in London. Savills’ data has shown that since 2011, a quarter of sales of London homes over £2m were in Labour-held seats, leading the property experts to conclude “the mansion tax could be a significant issue for the electorate in a number of key constituencies in London.” Constituencies thought likely to be particularly affected include Battersea, Hampstead & Kilburn and Hammersmith. Labour has said that owners of homes worth between £2m and £3m will have to pay around £250 a month, with the rates for higher property value bands not yet revealed. Labour estimates the tax will contribute approximately £2.5bn a year of extra funding.

Starbucks used UK holding company to avoid tax
Starbucks is under investigation by the European Commission after allegedly using a now-defunct UK business, called Alki LP, to enable it to pay a tax rate of less than 1% in the Netherlands. The company was registered to handle Starbucks's intellectual property. A Wall Street Journal investigation found Alki LP had no employees, never filed proper accounts and was registered at the offices of Starbucks's tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie.

Businesses holding back on investment
A survey of 500 chartered accountants working in British firms by the ICAEW has found 70% of businesses are holding back investment spending due to low confidence in the economy. Stephen Ibbotson, ICAEW director of business, urged the next Government to confirm new investment tax relief rates as soon as possible. He said: "We don't want to see firms just battening down their hatches which could stop our recovery in its tracks."

Lib Dems tax cuts funded by tax dodge clampdown
Nick Clegg has said a Lib Dem crackdown on tax dodgers and an increase in tax on shareholders' dividend payments will help fund a rise in the threshold at which people start paying income tax to £11,000 next year, and then lifting it to £12,500 by 2020.

PENSIONS

Young savers demanding access to pension cash
Pension firms are reporting a surge in interest from customers as young as 23 in taking out pension money under freedoms that came into effect on Monday. Anyone taking their money under the age of 55 will be considered by HMRC to be making an "unauthorised withdrawal" and be subject to a tax of 55%. Richard Parkin, head of retirement at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said some people were aware of the penalties but were demanding access to their cash anyway. Fidelity blocked access for a customer in his forties believing he had been targeted by a "pension liberation" scam. Separately, the BBC reports that some companies are not allowing savers to withdraw repeated lump sums from their pension pots. Others will not allow their clients to cash in the whole pot - and cannot promise to do so in the near future.

UBP chief defends Swiss private banking
Guy de Picciotto, chief executive of Union Bancaire Privée, has defended Switzerland’s credentials as a private banking centre after suggestions that the sector is entering a period of decline. The erosion of the country’s banking secrecy law, the appreciation of its currency and low interest rates have been cited as factors that will make it harder for Switzerland to compete with the likes of Singapore and Abu Dhabi. However, Mr de Picciotto told the FT: “The high level of expertise we have, as well as the stability of Switzerland and its low debt levels, still make it an attractive place as a custodian of wealthy people’s assets.”

ECONOMY

Service sector picks up speed
Activity in the UK’s services sector accelerated in March at its fastest pace since August last year, according to the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index. The index rose to 58.9 from February’s reading of 56.7. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. Markit said the increase in activity was the result of the wider economic recovery and improved confidence. Employment activity remained high within the sector while companies had also lowered their costs, Markit added. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the survey results “bode well for the upturn to retain strong momentum as we move through the spring”.

FPC warns of deficit threat to market confidence
The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee has warned that Britain's current account deficit could hit market confidence in Britain if the economy slows down. The Bank of England said that as long as investors remained confident in the UK, and the Treasury retained a "credible" fiscal policy, the current account deficit could be financed, but it added that the deficit's size meant that a shock to the system could trigger panic. Elsewhere, the IMF has warned that the global economy is facing a period of prolonged low productivity, as leading economies’ working age populations shrink, business investment remains low and QE stimulus packages fail to lift the real economy. Separately, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser to PwC, outlines risks to the global economy in the Times.
