Hello Craig

First of all I want apologize that I have not been able to take your call, I am very very sorry about that. I tried calling you now but your number was on voice mail.

I am forwarding this information to technical team and tomorrow when I will reach office first thing I will do is I will call you that will be around 1pm UK time.

Once again very sorry.

Regards

Steve
