Dear Steve,

Need help,may I do the business before VAT register? I want to VAT return,I already apply for VAT on Aug 22,2011.
Will take the number in three weeks. But I really hurry to purchase something. And I will get the invoice from supplier after 4months. So,this business can apply for VAT return? I mean that purchase something before get the vat number,I can ask for supplier make the invoice after I get the vat number,is that okey? 
Otherwise,I have to wait the VAT number and then can run my first business? Or can give me a VAT number for temporary need ?
Another question,my supplier will be sent invoice to me in the future,the invoice can sent to you? I mean you can help me prepare the accounting.



Wait for your reply!

Best regards,
