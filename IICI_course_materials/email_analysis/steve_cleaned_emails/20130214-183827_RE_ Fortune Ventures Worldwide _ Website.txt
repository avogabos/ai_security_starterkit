Re :  Your Designs.
 
 
I have received your designs., I would request you to keep it on hold for few days, as I am also working on the designs.
 
The logo and the designs need to be carefully finalised. Once its done you cant do anything on that. 
I will keep you posted once I am ready to share some designs with you and Ms. Charlotte for finalisation.
 
May I request you to kindly let me know the position of the US and Hong Kong Office ?? In which place of US are we getting the address . Charlotte had said it would take approx 20 days. That would be required to finalise the designs
of the Letter Pad and the Visiting Cards also.
 
Thanks for your support.
 
 



With best regards and compliments.
