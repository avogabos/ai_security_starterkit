Dear Steve,
even if I've not received an answer from your Company, I
just made the bank transfer of 90 GBP (127.00 €uros) to pay the Annual Return +
filing fees for my Company.
Remember that actually the CBMCo.Ltd is a "non
trading" (dormant) Company.
Please, kindly provide to send the document to  HMRC
and Company House.
When done notice me and send me
a copy of it.
Here attached you can find the
bank transfer order.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely yours
Edoardo Figliolìa
