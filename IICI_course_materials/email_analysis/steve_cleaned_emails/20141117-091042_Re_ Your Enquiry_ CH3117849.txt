Dear Mr Smith

PHONE CORPORATION LTD

Thank you for your enquiry of 13th November 2014 concerning the restoration of the above company.

The company was dissolved because the Annual Return for the date of 26th July 2012 was not submitted despite sending reminder letters.

There are two procedures for restoring companies to the register, which are:
            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
            - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - http://www.gov.uk<http://www.gov.uk/> and search for ?waiver letter?).

3)  Annual Return form for the year ending 26th July 2012, 2013 and 2014 each requiring a £40 filing fee.

4)  Accounts for the period ending 31st July 2012 and 2013.

Having checked our records there are no late filing penalties.

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court .

Information regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website - ?http://www.gov.uk?  and search for ?guide to company restoration?.

If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may use the same name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

Yours sincerely
