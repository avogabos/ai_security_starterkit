Dear Mr. Steve,
 
Greetings !!!!
 
We are facing a problem regarding the SIC code for Annual returns.
 
The fact was that when we first went to your office and spoke in details with yours Ms. Charlotte we had said that the main objective of our business activities would be as follows :
 



To carry on business through Direct selling of all kinds
of products and services. To operate as a Direct selling company for all kinds
of consumer related products and services and to manufacture, purchase , sell ,
trade, import, export, raise and also provide consultancy for consumer goods
and services through Direct selling system. To appoint Direct sellers to sell
or market our products, through the companies own system and structure. 


But somehow we could not start our activities and operation. In the table of SIC code as provided by you I could not locate any code which exactly matches to our main objectives. The only one which is somewhat near to our objective is number  47990.
 
Kindly guide and advise us :
 
Normally across the globe while opening a company there comes few Main objectives of the company followed by all other activities possible. Which means that initially the Main Objectives as stated in the MOA will identify the mode of operation of the company but in future the company can do any sort of legal and valid business.
 
I hope it is the same in UK companies also. Just let me know that if we file our Annual Returns through any one of the SIC codes can we change that in the next year while filing the Returns ??
 
So far your list of SIC codes is concerned number 47990  looks OK with us. Kindly cross check once for our sake if there is anything which is closest to our objective as written in blue above.
 
Will wait for your confirmation. Sorry if we are bothering you.
With sincere compliments & best wishes....
