HI Chris,

 

I did send it to him before xmas, and I have tried to email him to confirm
several times. I will see if I can order another copy of the same letter,
and I have a photocopy of it in the office, but if they want the original
then he needs to check in his haymarket branch

I will once more try and make contact

 

Thanks]

Hi Charlotte/Steve

 

Our UK Bank Account is still not open.

 

I believe Raj is waiting for a revised document from the Seychelles

 

Can you let me know if this has been sent to him, so we can chase him

 

Thanks

Chris
