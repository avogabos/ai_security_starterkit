Dear Steve, 

 

Thank you very much.

 

Answers to your questions:

 

1)Company Source of Funds: The company shall be funded by equity capital by
the shareholder and by a loan from the Shareholder as a deposit for the
property.  It is anticipated  that 50% of the funds required to purchase any
property shall be funds by banks.

 

2) Business Activity: Purchase a real estate for investment.

 

3) Directors occupation : property developer.

 

 

I am assuming that both companies are being incorporated.   Laskaris
Properties One and Laskaris Properties Two 

 

 

 

Best Wishes,

 


Yours Sincerely

Dear Bhisham Dindyal

 

 

The documents seems to be fine. We are forwarding these to registrar to

-          Company Source of Fund

-          Company Business Activity

-          Company Director's Occupation
