Dear Steve,
Happy new year!
I am attaching something that was sent to our office address
at Harley street it has been signed for and it was never forwarded to me as
well as an envelope from De Grisogono jewelry one month ago.
Please be kind enough to tell me who received my items and
why have I not been notified? I thought that everything received would be
forwarded to me at home in Faringdon. I am paying for his service right???
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Maria
