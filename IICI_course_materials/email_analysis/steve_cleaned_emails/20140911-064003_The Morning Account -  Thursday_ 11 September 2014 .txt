Small firms win RTI reprieve
In the latest relaxation of RTI rules, HMRC has announced that it will exempt small employers with 49 or fewer staff from RTI late filing penalties until March 2015. Until that date, they will be allowed to submit PAYE information monthly. "We know from our experience of rolling out of RTI that to ensure a smooth transition for our customers it's best to introduce changes in stages. This will allow us to update our systems and enhance our guidance and customer support as needed. We know that those who have had most difficulty adjusting to real-time reporting have been small businesses, so this staged approach means they have a little more time to comply with the new arrangements before facing a penalty," HMRC’s director-general for personal tax Ruth Owen comments. The exemption was welcomed by the CIOT as a “positive step”, however, it warned that wrinkles remain in the overall system. It warns that the taxman is guilty of firing off erroneous message to small firms, accusing many of these firms of late filing, non-filing and late payment. This results in additional form-filling for these businesses, and often requires a lengthy appeals process.

Diversity in City and State
A survey from the Green Park Public Service Leadership has found that ethnic diversity in local authority leadership is so low that it "almost defies analysis". Researchers said that although the leadership of FTSE 100 firms suffered from a "diversity deficit" it was still better in many respects to that achieved by the state. Meanwhile, the Independent notes that despite over half the UK population being female, only four FTSE 100 CEOs are women while just one blue-chip firm is chaired by a woman. Véronique Laury will become the fifth female FTSE 100 CEO when she takes over from Sir Ian Cheshire as chief executive of Kingfisher in January. Grant Thornton’s International Business Report last month found the number of world business leaders in favour of gender quotas has increased from 37% in 2013 to 45% in 2014.

Tackling tax avoidance must be central to SDGs
Writing in the Guardian, Thomas Pogge of Yale University, comments on UN negotiations over new sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the opportunity to synthesise these with reforms against tax abuse. Mr Pogge cites think tank Global Financial Integrity’s estimates that $4.7tr (£2.9tr) were siphoned out of developing countries during 2002-11 through trade misinvoicing by multinationals. However, Mr Pogge also points out that although the SDG draft text talks of curbing illicit flows from developing countries it fails to make any specific demands on richer nations to stop facilitating this drain on development. Mr Pogge concludes that lobbying efforts to prevent or dilute any reforms must be resisted in order to build a more transparent financial system and eradicate poverty.

Ten years of uncertainty
Edward Fennell talks to experts on both sides of the border about the practical outcomes of a Yes vote in the Scottish referendum. On pensions, commentators point to the consequences of having to fund cross-border schemes which could result in a pensions black hole worth several billion pounds. Baker Tilly’s George Bull adds that differences in income tax rates could result in “a horrible mix of red tape and loopholes for tax avoidance (or even evasion) as workers and companies flit across the border to wherever the rates are lowest.” Dorothy Livingston at Herbert Smith Freehills predicts at least ten years of uncertainty in the event of a Yes vote as new laws and institutions are built and tested and international treaties are negotiated.

Acceptance-in-Lieu data
New figures have revealed that works of art and other heritage worth over £100m were accepted by the Government instead of tax, as part of an Acceptance-in-Lieu scheme, between 2009 and 2013. The data emerged following a Parliamentary question asked by MP Andrew Smith who wanted to know the total value of art works accepted in lieu of inheritance tax in each of the last five years.

PwC to face Colonial lawsuit
PwC and Crowe Horwath are to face a lawsuit accusing them of professional malpractice and breach of contract for failing to detect a fraud that led to the 2009 collapse of Colonial Bank, a federal judge in New York has ruled. U.S. District Judge Keith Watkins rejected the auditors' motion to dismiss complaints that the firms made "reckless and grossly inaccurate" reports to the bank's board, allowing Colonial to conceal a seven-year fraud that drained it of $1.8bn. PwC and Crowe are also facing a lawsuit from Colonial’s receivers, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which claims the accountants missed "huge holes" in Colonial's balance sheet caused by the diversion of money to now bankrupt Taylor Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. Caroline Nolan, a spokeswoman for PwC, said it audited Colonial "in full accordance with professional standards". The case will now go forward in district court.

Campaign launched to target engineering skills gap
The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) has called on MPs to play a part in plugging the engineering skills gap by encouraging employers in their constituencies to work with schools to teach young people about the opportunities available. The IET said that more than half of employers are having difficulties recruiting the staff they needed for their businesses to expand. Recent research found that the UK needs to almost double the number of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) graduates it produces in order to meet demand.

Britain must take risks
Lord Digby Jones, the former head of the CBI, will issue a warning today that Britain has become too “risk averse” and that government and industry must work together to break down the barriers holding back growth. He will add that smaller businesses in general needed greater support if the economic recovery is to be sustained. Speaking at the Institute for Turnaround conference, he will say: “With any small business, especially one in its early stages, there are obstacles to overcome and calculated risks that must be taken in order to generate wealth. Too often the emphasis is put on failing businesses - without the appreciation that there always exists a risk reward aspect to growth and generating profits.”

Banks confirm move south if Scotland votes Yes
Lloyds Bank has announced that it will move its legal headquarters from Edinburgh to London if Scotland votes for independence, with RBS and Clydesdale Bank indicating that they will follow suit. A number of banks have reported an increase in the number of customers shifting accounts to English-based banks amid fears that their money may not be secure if there is a Yes vote and to also ensure protection from UK regulators. Experts believe difficult and protracted negotiations could see investment put on hold with capital and businesses migrating south. Elsewhere, investor George Soros writes in the Financial Times that: “A vote for independence would weaken, in political and economic terms, both a truncated UK and Scotland.” The Guardian cites industry insiders who suggest banks may transport extra cash to Scotland to "ensure appropriate liquidity" if customers want to withdraw more cash and reduce exposure and risk by limiting the loan-to-value offered to people seeking mortgages, while the Telegraph notes BoE governor Mark Carney’s comment that Scotland could need £150bn in financial reserves to ensure stability.

Standard Life issues independence threat
Standard Life has warned that it is planning to shift large parts of its business to England in the event of a Yes vote in next week’s Scottish referendum. The pensions and insurance group said that “if there was a need to do so”, it would make drastic changes to its business structure to cope with Scotland seceding. David Nish, the company's chief executive, said: “Standard Life has a long history in Scotland – a heritage of which we are very proud – and we hope that this continues but our responsibility is to protect the interests of our customers, our shareholders, our people and other stakeholders in our business.” Standard Life has raised concerns about what currency an independent Scotland would use, its membership of the EU, and the shape of financial regulation and taxation regimes.

New EU president Jean-Claude Juncker has appointed Lord Hill of Oareford, the Conservative Peer, to oversee Europe’s financial services sector.

The powerful Socialist bloc of MEPs in Europe have warned that Lord Hill’s appointment will be vetoed unless he enforces an EU cap on banker bonuses.
