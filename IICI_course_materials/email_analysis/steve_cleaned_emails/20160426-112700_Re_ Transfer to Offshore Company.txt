Dear Steve,
Many thanks for your prompt reply.
Yes, I am interested in registering a new offshore company. My main reason
are taxes, so probably for this reason I would need to close my UK company?
I am a German citizen living in Dubai but I might move to the UK soon. What
is important for me that either ways I would avoid paying both company and
income tax.
Could you confirm this?
Best,
Stefanie

Dear Steve,

I hope you are doing well.

I am interesting to transforming my company to an offshore company to avoid
taxes.

I am a German citizen presently residing in Dubai but there is a chance that
I am relocating to the UK soon.

Would be great if you could advise me accordingly.

Many thanks in advance,

Stefanie
