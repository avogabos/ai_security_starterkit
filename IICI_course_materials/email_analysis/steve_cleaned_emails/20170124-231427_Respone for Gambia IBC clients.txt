Hi,

 

You can use following information to reply queries from Gambia IBC clients,
new and existing.

Dear Customer,

 

We apologies for the delay in answering your concern, we wanted to recheck
the current status of The Gambia.

 

The government has a lot of unrest at the moment and there have been
multiple changes in the ministry positions. They have withdrawn the notices
as these were replaced by a new minister who wanted the evidence of the
signed Presidential Decree approving the implementation of the iCommerce
Registry in Gambia and the Commerce Zone near Banjul Airport.

 

iCommerce Registry website has been taken away from public access, and
access is limited for forming new IBC's. We have left the product on our
website as it enables potential customers to contact us and discuss an
alternative option unless they wish to go ahead with the IBC as according
the contract between iCommerce Registry and The government of Gambia which
is still valid and has not been formerly revoked.

 

Formations House however is currently working with several new jurisdictions
to offer another option in the same vein as Gambia but in a country with
much less instability.

 

If you wish to renew, you may. We can offer in the future once the new
jurisdiction are available, the option to relocate the company, with same
name and if possible the same company number. We would look to do this at
minimal cost.

 

I hope this email has helped clarify the position, but please do feel free
to ask any further questions.

 

Regards,

 

Customer Support
