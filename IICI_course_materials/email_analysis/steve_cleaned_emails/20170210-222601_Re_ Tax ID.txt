Hi Cindy
Yes share
transfer is complete. But we have not increase the share capital, before we
increase it I just want you to know allotting maximum number of shares can
cause tax liability on company at the time of annual filing and will conflict
with company status which is DORMANT.
The best
option is to keep share allotment minimum to 1. Since only 1 share is issued and
there are no other shareholder, so current shareholder is considered 100% owner
of the company.
Please
advice how you wish to have the share capital.
And there
is small issue which we will get it fixed by next week but it will not affect
company operations in any way, the issue is we have appointed current director
as PSC but we are not able to remove our person form the PSC, it will be done
by next week as Companies House and we are looking at our systems to resolve the
PSC termination issue.
