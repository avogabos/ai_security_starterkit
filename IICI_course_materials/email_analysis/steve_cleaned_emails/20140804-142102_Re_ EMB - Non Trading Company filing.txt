Dear Steve and Oliver,

have you received the UTR code from HMRC?
Does this prevent you from filing the non-trading accounts with Company
House (reminder the deadline is Wednesday 6 August 2014).

Thank you for your kind help
Kind regards
Catherine

Re: EMB - Non Trading Company filing
Dear Steve,
We have looked into all papers.
We have not received any papers from HMRC. And we do not have the Company UTR.
Can you double check whether
Formations House received a paper from HMRC after the cy incorporation?
I do not know how to obtain the
UTR from HMRC? And would appreciate your advice.
Kind regards
Catherine

Re: EMB - DCA filing
Dear
Oliver,
Ok this
is clear.
Just
one last question: do you confirm that EMB qualifies for Dormant Company as
-
the cy has not traded
- BUT
EMB has made expenses (eg IT costs).
If EMB
qualifies for DCA filing, then I will have the money transfered to your account
(75GBP) and you will be able to go ahead.
Many
thanks for your kind help
