?Hi


I am very confused by your payroll service - in the past I have used payroll services and it means that the payroll is done for us.


All we have to provide is the employees details and they amount paid in the month and all the filing is done for us.


All we then have to do is pay a cheque to the HMRC.


You now mention e-filings?  What is this? How do we do this?


In the last financial year we paid:


Marija Kozlova £5000 on 20/02/15 and £5000 on 31/03/15


Can you please add this to the payroll for last year - then tell me what to do to get the HMRC records up to date so we do not have to pay this estimate.


Also how do can I get payslips for Marija.


Thanks

Chris
