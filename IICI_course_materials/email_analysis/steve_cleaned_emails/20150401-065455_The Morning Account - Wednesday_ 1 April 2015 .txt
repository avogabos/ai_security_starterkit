TAX

Business opposes Labour’s corporation tax rise
Labour has defended its policy of raising corporation tax in order to help small businesses after opponents claimed the move could cost thousands of jobs. Ed Miliband has promised 250,000 smaller firms a £400 cut in business rates but the Conservative party attacked the plan for being funded by a corporation tax hike. Meanwhile, the Telegraph publishes a letter from over 100 business leaders arguing that deviating from the Conservatives’ economic policy will threaten jobs and deter investment. It comes as David Cameron and George Osborne pledged they will not raise income tax, NICs or VAT for the full five years of the next Parliament.

Tories warn of SNP tax threat
The Conservatives have warned that the SNP would try to use a hung parliament to force Ed Miliband to increase taxes, after publishing figures showing the party’s replacement for stamp duty would cost homebuyers £30m more. The Tories say the Scottish Government’s Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) would have generated nearly £194m if it had been in place last year, whereas stamp duty would have raised less than £165m over the same period.

McDonald's under EU tax scrutiny
The Guardian reports that EU antitrust regulators have asked Luxembourg for information on McDonald’s tax affairs. It comes after unions from the US and Europe last month urged the European Commission to investigate issues with around 1bn euros ($1.07bn) in tax between 2009 and 2013.

INDUSTRY

Executive pay falling in real terms
Research by PwC suggests executive pay is falling in real terms, with just under half of chief executives receiving no rise in their salaries this year. The report says bonus payments to CEOs of the FTSE 100 have increased by 3% after three years of decline. However, total pay for CEOs – including salary, benefits and payouts from LTIPs – rose by an average of 0.7%, to £3.5m, meaning executive pay is falling once inflation is taken into account. The report reveals 45% of FTSE 100 companies have frozen CEO salaries this year, up from 25% last year. One in five of those chief executives have chosen to waive their salary increase. Overall, salaries have gone up by 2% on average.

Seaside towns have most insolvencies
New figures from Experian show that seaside towns and those in the North of England tend to have the highest rates of insolvency. Torquay, Scarborough and Penzance have the highest rates of personal insolvencies anywhere in Britain, while 19 out of the 30 towns with the highest rates of insolvency are in the North of England and north Wales.

Auditors urged to engage with boards on cyber security
A survey of 800 internal audit professionals, including chief audit executives, conducted by Protiviti, has found that organisations whose boards of directors are highly engaged with security risks are more likely to meet cyber security and data privacy standards.

EY commits to St Peter's Square
EY has become the first firm to sign-up to move into Two St Peter's Square in Manchester. It has agreed to lease three floors of offices in the 11-storey building.

PENSIONS

Public sector workers still better off
Analysis by the IFS suggests public sector workers such as teachers and doctors will still be better off in retirement than most private sector workers, despite reforms which will see them lose their "goldplated" pensions today. The research shows that the taxpayer will still pay the equivalent of £4,800 each year into the pension pot of an average public-sector worker earning £27,000. Conversely, a private-sector employer would give an annual pension contribution of only £1,400 of the average private-sector salary of £27,800.

SMEs

Regulator targets control of money transfer systems
Hannah Nixon, MD of the Payment Systems Regulator, says the watchdog intends to take control of the money transfer systems from the large high street banks. The regulator, which launches today, will open up access of the infrastructure underpinning financial transactions, from mobile payments to house purchases. "We want to break open the control of payment systems, so it's not just the big banks that control them who can use them," said Ms Nixon.

Individual savers invest in SME loans
The Mail reports that billions of pounds are being invested in loans to SMEs by savers hunting for better interest rates. A growing number of individuals are looking to peer-to-peer loans with the aim of getting a better return than they would from a bank or building society.

ECONOMY

Economic growth revised up
The UK's economy grew at a faster pace than initially estimated last year, revised official figures show. The economy grew by 0.6% in the final three months of 2014, up from the previous estimate of 0.5%, the Office for National Statistics said. The unexpected increase meant growth for the year was 2.8%, higher than the earlier estimate of 2.6%. The revised rate marks the highest pace of annual growth since 2006, when the economy grew by 3%. An expansion in both production and services as well as household spending helped to drive the increase, the official data suggested. But the biggest contribution to the revised figure was a strong performance of exports, the ONS said.

Indian HSBC tax evaders given ultimatum
The Indian government has told HSBC customers suspected of tax evasion to locate a legal representative in Switzerland within the next month, or face being ousted in the country’s official gazette. A letter sent to the alleged evaders shows that Switzerland will support Indian tax authorities in their investigative efforts, possibly by handing over in-depth details on accounts involved in the scandal, and advises clients to legally challenge the disclosure of such information within 30 days, or come forth and cooperate in the repayment of owed sums.

Organised crime in the EU worth €110bn
A study by the Organised Crime Portfolio, co-funded by the European Commission, has found that revenues from organised crime in the EU are worth at least €110bn a year. The research suggests illicit markets — including drugs, arms, human trafficking, counterfeiting and tax fraud — are equivalent to 1% of EU GDP.

Professionals happier at home
A poll by recruiter Robert Walters has found 50% of professionals say they perform best when able to work remotely, but a third of employers still do not allow it. Despite the high cost of commuting and long travel times, Londoners are least likely to work remotely than other professionals across the UK.
