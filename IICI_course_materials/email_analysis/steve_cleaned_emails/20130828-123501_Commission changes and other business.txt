Commission for August onwards

 

Flat 4% on all standard orders from Formations House Customers

Does not include government charges etc.. I wont deduct gov charges on
offshore at the moment, as they vary so much in each jurisdiction however if
its a restoration then we have to. 

 

5% flat on any Gambia Licence orders minus the cost of the licence from
iCommerce as we have to pay this.. 

 

So that means on a bank licence you sell to UK customer at £40k minimum and
our cost for government fee is $40k (working out at about £25,000) other
services on top are classed as 5% on charged amount so its best to upsell
everything.

 

No more targets, as its impossible to set at the moment however, I expect a
general increase in business form everyone from September onwards. 

 

I appreciate August is the toughest time of year due to holidays globally so
we have done well to keep the order volumes as they are. 

 

Staffing will be addressed also in September as we are expecting new
recruits in Sales and Support to help you guys focus on new sales.

 

From October I will implement commission sharing on ICommerce agents
business, meaning you need to be motivated to keep signing up agents. The
details of how the sharing will work will be given later in September, but
rest assured everyone will benefit from the company working together to
bring in sales by recruiting and support agents to offer their customers
Gambia companies and licences.

 

This means each of you have 2 channels for commission, you have direct sales
through Formations House, and also indirect sales through supporting and
recruiting agents for icommerce. 

 

More PR is being done over the next 2 weeks for ICommerce including articles
printed in the FT and hopefully the Economist. This will bring agents to us.

 

The Bank account situation in Gambia is also being addressed, ECO Bank are a
good bank and are fast in opening however we underestimated how many things
they ask for before processing. So far 1 is open for one of our own
companies, and they have provisionally approved others but want the Tax IDs
before committing.

 

FBME and Rietumu are open provisionally agreeing to open accounts for
Gambia, this should become active in the next 3 weeks and then of course we
know exactly what the time frames are. We can then sell Gambia all day long
to Formations House customers, and agents will be very happy to offer gambia
if they can give known bank accounts too.

 

Hong Kong companies will be added to Formations House shortly, I personally
get a lot fo interest from our clients for HK companies, and we need to play
up on the disclosure issues in other jurisdictions such as BVI, Panama and
Mauritius in order to push Gambia and HK.

 

On another note, I am working from home tomorrow and doing some other
personal business. I will check emails etc time to time, but Alisa and Tahir
are in the office to assist otherwise.
