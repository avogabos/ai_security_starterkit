Dear Steve,
I can not thank you enough for your professionalism.
There is one very imprint issue though.
My flight arrives at Heathrow airport at 2.00 on the 24th December hence telling you that the 29th and 30th of December as the dates I would be available from he beginning for the meeting.
Can we do something about this please?
Waiting with anticipation your response I remain at your disposal.
Kind regards,
