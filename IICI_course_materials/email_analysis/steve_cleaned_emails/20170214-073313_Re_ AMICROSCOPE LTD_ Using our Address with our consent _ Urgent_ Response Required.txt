Hi Steve,

We are very disappointed about this. We are not UK company and we don't
know about those details about different mails. We never know that mails
from HMRC for VAT will be singled out of our registered address service.

Have you returned the VAT letters? We urgently need those letters. If not,
we'd like to have these letters forwarded (you may charge one time fee for
this).

Is trading address including Value Accounting and OutSource Accounts
Department ONLY? I don't want to have other surprises in the future.

Thanks,

Dear Andrew Wu
It has come to our knowledge that your company AMICROSCOPE
LTD (Company number
08256434
) is using our
address as TRADING Address with VAT office WITHOUT our consent and payment for
service charges.
Please note that as per our agreement for REGISTERED
ADDRESS service you can only use our address to receive official mails for
company from Companies House and HMRC (corporation tax) and those will be
forwarded to you, for VIRTUAL OFFICE MAIL ONLY can only be use to general mails
but it do not include our address to be use as TRADING Address for VAT purpose.
Also as per our terms and conditions TRADING ADDRESS,
Virtual Officer Mail only and Registered Address are 3 separate services.
Therefore please change your company’s trading address and
remove our address with VAT office as soon as possible. OR if you wish to use
our address as your company’s TRADING address with VAT office then you need
purchase following services:
-
Virtual Office InfiniOffice Mail only 12 months : GBP
225 (per annum) – you already have this service and it is expiring on 23 Feb
2017.
-
Value Accounting : GBP 300 (per annum)
-
OutSource Accounts Department : GBP 300 (per annum)
Note that since you are using our address as TRADING Address
without our consent and without paying service charges any mails from VAT
office received for company will not be forwarded to you, which can cause
company to go into bad standing and government can impose financial penalties
on company and we will not be responsible for it. Currently we are receiving
mails from HMRC for VAT which we are unable to forward it to you and those have
been returned to VAT.
Please change company address as soon as possible or if you
wish to use our address then please make arrangements as mentioned above.
If address is not changed or if we did not receive your
response within 3 working days, then we will report it to VAT office.
