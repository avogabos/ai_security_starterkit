Dear Steve,
Since the company has started after 10 January 2017, the company will not be dormant for the period from 1st July 2016 to 30 June 2017 and after reviewing the transactions, the preparation of Annual Accounts will take around three weeks.
Further, as far as the VAT is concerned, since the goods are not physically being in UK, there will not be any implication on UK VAT.
We also provide payroll and self assessment services, therefore, you are at the best position to quote the prices regarding these services.
Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.
Regards,
Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
