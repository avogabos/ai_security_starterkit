Dear Sir,

RE: LCO CAPITAL INVEST LIMITED  06707554

Thank you for your email.

A company that wishes to continue to trade may be restored to the register either by Administrative Restoration or by Order of Court. Information on both procedures can be obtained on our website at: www.companieshouse.gov.uk<http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/> (please refer to "Guidance" on our homepage and then select guidance GP4 - Strike off, Dissolution and Restoration").

Should the above company apply for Administrative Restoration the Registrar will require the following documents and filing fees to complete the application:-

Form RT01 (application form for administrative restoration) with its £100 filing fee

The Treasury Solicitor?s waiver letter. This can be ordered online at bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration/aspx. Please note that the filing fee for form BVC14 is £69 made  payable to the Treasury Solicitor.

Accounts for the period ending 30th September 2010 and 30th September 2011

Annual Return (form 363a) for the year ending 25th September 2009 with its £30 filing fee ( Please note, from the 1st October 2012 no fee is required for any Companies Act 1985 forms, therefore, if the form 363a is submitted on or after this date you will not have to pay the filing fee)

Annual Return (form AR01) for the year ending 25th September 2010 with its £40 filing fee
Annual Return (form AR01) for the year ending 25th September 2011 with its £40 filing fee

Please note the Annual Returns forms can be downloaded from our website www.companieshouse.gov.uk, there are 2 different 363a and AR01 forms, if you require any assistance, to ensure the correct form is printed, please telephone our contact centre on 0303 1234500

I confirm that there are no late filing penalties.

It would be advisable to submit all documents and payments in one package, ensuring it is marked for the attention of the Restoration Section.

If you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully,

Maxine Hartrey
