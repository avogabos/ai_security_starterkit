Re: Technology Digital Ltd - Documents
OK Thanks.
Apologies for chasing but I have a client who needs to send me a contract and I need to invoice.
My client also sent me this which I presume will be taken care of with your submission?:
The shares of the company are still being updated.
I looked on the previous annual returns which shows a company named Nominee Director Ltd owns 100% of the shares.
As we are unable to confirm who owns the shares within the company, we will not be able to engage until these details are uploaded to companies house.
Please confirm. Thanks.
