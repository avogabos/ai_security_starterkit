Hi Thomas

 

 

Do as well need ACME SUPPORT LTD, which was your previous order.

 

 

Also just to inform you that companies with price 150 GBP are also for 165
GBP because we will need to file Annual Returns after company transfer and
Government fee for Annual Returns is 15 GBP per a company.

 

Also we will need to add Nominee Shareholder 25 GBP per annum per annum.

 

You will need Natural Person Nominee Director 500 GBP per annum for UK
companies because as per law there must be atleast 1 natural person as
company director.

 

Nominee Director 400 GBP per annum gives you a corporate director. We can
remove Nominee Secretary service because it is not a mandatory requirement.

 

 

Please provide confirmation for above and I will update you on discounted
price.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve

Steve,  

 

I am interested in purchasing  the   above companies all with  nominee
directors, and registered address in the UK the purpose is  to  satisfy
requirements for merchant processing solutions offered by acquiring  banks.
No requirement for bank  accounts or anything else, companies will not
trade directly therefore there will be no turnover.

 

Please offer package pricing, we are prepared to purchase immediately if
pricing  and  terms   are acceptable, also will  have ongoing   requirement
for  approximately  three companies monthly.

 

 

 

Thomas Wells
