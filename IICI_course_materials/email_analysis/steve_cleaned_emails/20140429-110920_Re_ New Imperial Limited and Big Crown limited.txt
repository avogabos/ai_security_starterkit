Dear Steve,

Any news from a Comoros bank regarding posibility to open accounts for 
Gambian IBCs?

If this issue is still uncertain our clients may consider the option of 
having UK shelf-companies instead.

I look forward to having your vision how we can settle this situation in 
mutually beneficial way.

Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Steve,
Thank you for your email. I informed our clients accordingly
            but they are not
            interested in establishing companies in BVI or Seychelles.
            They asked whether
            it is possible to open banking accounts in other banks
            located outside Gambia.
Best regards,
Andrei

Dear
              Andrei
Unfortunately
till
              now it is not possible to open bank account for a Gambia.
Other
option
              is to have a BVI or Seychelles company for which we can
              open bank
              account with FBME Cyprus.
The
cost
              will be:
-
Seychelles company with bank account 895
              GBP
-
BVI company with bank account 1600 GBP
If
you
              wish to proceed, you can pay the difference and we will
              then proceed.
Regards
Steve

Dear Steve,
I hope that this email finds you well. Our clients who
            incorporated two
            companies in Gambia, i.e. Big Crown Limited and New Imperial
            Limited in 2013,
            also ordered the service of corporate account opening in
            Gambian Eco Bank.
            However, as we understand your negotiations with the bank
            have not lead to
            positive outcome. Thus, they request to return money paid
            for incorporation of
            these two companies and bank accounts opening. Therefore, I
            would like to know
            your view of this situation before addressing their
            requests. What can be done
            from your end in order to settle this situation amicably?
Best regards,
