Dear All

I really do not understand why we are not getting 1 email with all what you
need so we do not waste time, everyday we are receiving some new requests
from your company, we know Formation House is one of the oldest and most
reputed company in UK for registering company but it seems this time we are
not getting a right approach. Please clarify if we need more documents so
we send everything in 1 shot.

Your soon reply will be much appreciated.


Regards
