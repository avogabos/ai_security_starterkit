An LLP allows for a tax-efficient
strategy as they are considered “fiscally transparent” by HMRC, so
the Partnership itself is not taxed; only the profits that go directly to the
partners are taxed. As the partners are taxed directly, this means:
- Non-UK residents will only pay UK

the UK will only be taxed at the partner’s usual tax rate, depending on
their country of residency;
The cost to register a LLP company
in the UK is 500 GBP; the time required to complete the procedure is 3-4 weeks.

UK LLP are:
