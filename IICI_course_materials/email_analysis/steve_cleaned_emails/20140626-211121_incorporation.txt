From: Ronny Karduner <ronny@karduner.co.il>

Dear Steve,

We are looking for offshore incorporation (BVI, BELIZE, SEYCHELLE etc).
It is important to receive the full service (including registration,
Nominee, Bank account opening service).
At this moment we need 6 companies.

The questions & requirement are:

1.	Prices for the full package.
2.	The opening of bank account requirement (including supporting
documents, deposit etc).
3.	The bank details (we are looking for banks with good reputation).

I represent clients for this service. The process will be done with me. Of
course you will receive all the details and documents required.

Best regard,

Ronny
