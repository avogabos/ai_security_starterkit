Please note that we can guarantee bank account opening, final is taken by bank.

 

If you are doing operations outside and if company’s bank account is outside of UK then if you wish, you can file Dormant Company Accounts and ‘0’ Tax Returns. Or if you wish to file active accounts and tax returns for your company then you only need to send annual transactions on in excel sheet format, we will then prepare and file annual accounts and tax returns. Invoices are not required.
