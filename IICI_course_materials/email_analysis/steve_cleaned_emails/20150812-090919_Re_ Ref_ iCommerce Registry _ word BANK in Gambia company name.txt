Dear Mr. Ravin Chadha
Your details were forwarded to us from iCommerce Registry
regarding Gambia company registration with the word BANK in company name.
Please note that BANK is a sensitive word and to use the
word BANK in a Gambia company name the cost of company registration is GBP
5000.
You can send few company names so that we can check the
availability. Payment can be done online or by bank transfer. Once we have the
order, payment and due diligence documents company will be registered within 24
hours.
Documents required for due diligence for company
formation:
Scan color copies of following documents are required for
company beneficial owner/director/s and shareholder/s.
If company director a Natural Person:
1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility
bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card
statement. (Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these
are not acceptable.)
If company director a Corporate Entity:
1. Company Documents presenting beneficial owner name
(Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles)
2. Proof of ID (Valid Passport) and Proof of Address
(Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal
bank/credit card statement.) of the beneficial owner of the Corporate
body.(Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not
acceptable.)
If the documents are not in English then you need to have
them translated and notorized. And send original and translated copies.
