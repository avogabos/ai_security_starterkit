Hi,


Attached are the company documents for the HK Company VISA EXPRESS LIMITED.

Customer has to sign the consent to act as director document and send us the
scanned copy via email and also the original signed by post so that we may
forward the same to HK registry.

 

Also I will be emailing you the share transfer form which has to be signed
by the client as well and send us the original by post.
