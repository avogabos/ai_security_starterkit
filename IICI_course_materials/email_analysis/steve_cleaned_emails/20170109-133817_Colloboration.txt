Dear Steve,

I hope you are well.

I believe there are many areas where we can work together. OIL Global (www.oilglobal.com<http://www.oilglobal.com>) is a leading company formation wholesaler (b2b) and we have presence in several jurisdictions where we can offer formation services, to a very competitive price, to professional introducers like yourselves. We have presence in BVI, Seychelles, Belize to name a few.

We also have a state- of the art digital platform which allows you to manage your offshore companies online, at the same time have a point of contact in the specific jurisdiction and/ or UK time zone.

Hopefully we will be able to help you and also provide a better arrangement/ terms than your current agent(s).

Please let me know if you availability, I'd be very grateful to speak to you.

Kind regards,
Victor
