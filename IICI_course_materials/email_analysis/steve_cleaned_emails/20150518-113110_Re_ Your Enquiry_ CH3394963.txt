Dear Sir
JSM DESIGN LIMITED 08514138

We will require documents to be filed to show any change of the registered office address, or any changes relating to the officers of the company.


If the company is being restored only to recover assets, we will not require accounts or annual returns to be filed  However we will require documents to be filed to show any change of the registered office address, or any changes relating to the officers of the company.

The procedure usually takes approximately eight weeks to restore the company, after the company is restored you may release the assets held in the company name.

Once the assets are released we will require a form DS01 and £10 fee to be filed, to begin the process of dissolving the company.

If the assets are solely money in the company bank account, and the amount is less than £3000,  and you do not wish to restore the company to the register, please contact the Government Legal Department Bona Vacantia Division on 0207 210 4700 for further information.
