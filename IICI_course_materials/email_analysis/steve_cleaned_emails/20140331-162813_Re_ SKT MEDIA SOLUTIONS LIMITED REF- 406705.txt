Hi Steve

Please send the following back to the bank

1. I have 5 members of staff in UK and Tanzania and Kenya. We are all studio - based creative professionals and we work remotely. We do not all sit in the same office, and conduct our business over Skype and email.

2. There is no group structure - The only registered company is SKT Media Solutions. Big Score Audio and Wavekrest Media are simply websites showing portfolios of work, rather than separate companies. They are the customer facing front end of the business. 

3. I am a resident of the UK and you have my proof of address.


Please let me know once you have sent this back to the bank.


Matt
