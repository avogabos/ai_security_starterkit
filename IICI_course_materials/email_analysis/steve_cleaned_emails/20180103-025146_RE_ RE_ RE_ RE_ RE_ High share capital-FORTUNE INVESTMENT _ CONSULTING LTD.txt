Dear Steve and Customer Support,
I need urgently the DCA (Dormant Account Express) online for the Fortune Investment & Consulting Ltd, (N.08816301), the same type done for the Salomon Werner Hab Privee Ltd.
The Fortune is in proposal of strike off from today.
Dear Steve, I authorize the payment necessary.
