Hello Steve,

Many thanks for clarification. I would like to just confirm if we need to
use Power of Attorney to sign any cooperation agreement or Nominee Director
can sign it on behalf of our company? As well please clarify me how does
Nominee shareholder work and what are potential benefits comes from this
option? As I understand, we can not open any bank account (even outside UK)
based on Power of Attorney? We would like to proceed with the registration
of dormant UK company. If you would be so kind, please provide me with
required documents and information from our side? Does the procing include
all government fees? Many thanks for your support.

Hello Steve,
Many thanks for clarification. I would like to just confirm if we need to use Power of Attorney to sign any cooperation agreement or Nominee Director can sign it on behalf of our company? As well please clarify me how does Nominee shareholder work and what are potential benefits comes from this option? As I understand, we can not open any bank account (even outside UK) based on Power of Attorney? We would like to proceed with the registration of dormant UK company. If you would be so kind, please provide me with required documents and information from our side? Does the procing include all government fees? Many thanks for your support.

Hello
Bartek,
Sorry
I made mistake in my last email.
The
message should be like this:
Company
being dormant with our nominee director only, beneficial owner can ask for
Power of Attorney GBP 500 from Nominee Director. Bearer of power of attorney
can conduct all activities on behalf of the company such as SIGNING AGREEMENTS
ETC,
except bank account opening.
Beneficial owner cannot open company’s
bank account using the Power of Attorney.
Regards
Steve

Re: Incorporation of UK entity (payment agent)
Hello Steve,
Before we proceed with the registration I would like to ask
if you support Irish companies registartions? I wonder if such jurisdiction
would be better for our purposes. We would like to keep this company rather
dormant and appoint just nominee director. Although, we would like to sign
one agreement with psp company. Could you confirm if it is possible in this
option or we need to use any other services?
Best regards,
