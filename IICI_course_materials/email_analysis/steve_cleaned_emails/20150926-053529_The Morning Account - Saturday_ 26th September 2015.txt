Wealthy pawn assets to pay APNs
HMRC’s handing out of accelerated payment notices (APNs) has led to wealthy debtors pawning classic cars and other luxury assets in order to settle the tax bills. Since last August, more than 25,000 taxpayers have received demands to pay disputed sums as the Revenue seeks to reclaim £5.5bn it deems to have been avoided. Amounts demanded from APNs typically run into tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds, cannot be appealed, and require payment within 90 days. “There are certainly many who want to settle their APNs, but haven’t got that kind of cash sitting in their bank accounts,” said Richard Morley, a partner at BDO. Michael Avient, personal tax partner at UHY Hacker Young, added that “there has always been lending for tax bills.... but the volume has risen quickly as more people now need to pay these unexpected tax bills.” Paul Aitken, chief executive of online lender Borro, said the group was increasingly doing business with clients who were borrowing to pay off APNs.

Use tax to make buy-to-let less attractive
Considering the forthcoming Housing Bill, Kate Barker, chair of the Society of Business Economists and former Bank of England policymaker, claims that in addition to increasing supply, the government should also use the tax system to make buy-to-let less attractive as an investment. Ms Barker praises George Osborne for setting out in the last budget a reduction in the tax relief for mortgage interest for buy-to-let landlords, yet bemoans that the UK planning system "implicitly supposes" more housing involves an environmental cost, noting that owner-occupied homes remain exempt from capital gains tax and increasingly from inheritance tax. Ms Barker concludes that taking the opportunity of the council tax property revaluation to introduce capital gains tax on future house price rises would be controversial, but a welcome move. Meanwhile, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has published its first report on buy-to-let since the chancellor outlined the new tax arrangements in July. The CML said the increased tax would "be likely to deter some landlords from expanding their portfolios, and may encourage others to reduce their property holdings".

Rugby stars face bruising tax demands
International rugby players starring in the World Cup could face a hefty demand from HMRC because they are not exempted from a levy that extends to their global income. Foreign sportsmen have to pay the Revenue on earnings connected to their UK appearances, meaning any income from global sponsorship deals will be fair game for HMRC. “High profile players like Dan Carter and Brian Habana, for example, make reasonably big money from endorsements, and HMRC could make a claim,” said Pete Hackleton, a partner at Saffery Champness.

PENSIONS

Part-timers denied pension tax breaks
Research by Chase de Vere has found millions of part-time workers are being denied valuable tax breaks on their pension contributions because of a payroll anomaly. The concerns surround the use of “net pay” arrangements, which are commonly used by workplace pension schemes. Whereas in “relief at source” schemes, someone earning under £10,600 gets a top-up from the government that is paid into their pension pot, in a “net pay” arrangement that does not happen. The NAPF has stated: “The current anomaly between ‘net pay’ and ‘relief at source’ is a very real, although very recent, problem for both savers and schemes. We have asked the Government to conduct a thorough review of how this issue can best be resolved and avoided in the future.”

Avoiding pension tax traps
The Times outlines how the new pension freedom rules could affect savers, amid concerns that many people are cashing in their pensions without understanding the tax implications. In a survey of 800 customers, insurer Royal London discovered that two out of three (69%) had chosen to take all their pension as a cash lump sum. Of those surveyed, 16% said they intended to use the cash to clear their mortgage or other debts, 32% intended to withdraw money to place it all in an alternative savings or investment vehicle and 23% intended to leave the cash in a deposit or cash Isa account.

Lynch: HP warned of Autonomy accounting practices
Autonomy founder Mike Lynch claims that Hewlett-Packard had been made aware of accounting practices that it now alleges were fraudulent, prior to its takeover of the British firm. A due diligence report produced by KPMG prior to the 2011 deal highlighted Autonomy's sales of hardware "in limited situations" and the way it recognised sales to resellers rather than to end customers. Dr Lynch, who stands accused of leading a multibillion-dollar fraud, says that the report showed HP management knew or should have known how his company operated.

BoE warns of buy-to-let risks
The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee has warned that UK banks are vulnerable to the slowdown in China and that the UK’s buy-to-let mortgage market is increasingly becoming a concern. The FPC flagged up a series of threats to the UK’s financial stability following its quarterly meeting as it revealed that the outlook was “challenging”. It said December’s stress tests of banks’ balance sheets will include a scenario imagining a slowdown in China’s real economic growth from 7% to 1.7% and a one-third fall in Chinese and Hong Kong house prices. It also said buy-to-let mortgage lending, which has risen by 40% since 2008, had the potential to "amplify" a housing boom and bust.

Manufacturing can still thrive
Writing in the Telegraph, PwC’s Andrew Sentance says that despite new figures indicating manufacturing growth is stalling, the sector can still drive the UK economy. He admits Britain is no longer the “workshop of the world”, but points to the success of areas such as the car industry, where production in August was 40% up on a year ago. He cites four reasons why manufacturing can still prosper: The manufacturing businesses which remain in the UK are highly innovative and productive; The backbone of British manufacturing is provided by medium-sized companies; The UK is a very successful services exporter; And the climate is right to support the growth of new companies.

Footballers’ millions can last a lifetime
The FT examines the steps taken by professional footballers to ensure the money they earn during their playing years will last them a lifetime. The average weekly salary for a Premier League player was around £31,000 in 2012/13, according to Deloitte, but as the average Premier League career lasts just eight years, the paper suggests this constitutes a much more modest figure when spread over many decades. Peter Fairchild of Smith & Williamson recommends that players consider three “pots” for their weekly wage: Day-to-day living expenses; debts such as a mortgage or a car; and long-term investments, such as funds or property. Meanwhile, Sean Scahill of EOS Wealth Management says that in a low interest rate environment, “there are three games in the world: cash, property and fund management”.
