Dear Customer,
At the moment we cannot proceed with Certificate of Good Standing for SALOMON WERNER HAB PRIVEE LIMITED as you have not submitted Annual Return after 100000 shares transferred from IOHANAN PESACH AMI BISTRITSKY HALEVY to APEX FUND.
We now request you to submit Annual Returns as soon as possible to update current share structure at Companies House and we will then proceed with Certificate of Good Standing.
The cost of Annual Return submission is 15GBP and you can submit it with the help of Online Company Administrator Service.
If you need any further assistance do not hesitate to contact us.
Kind Regards,
Customer Support
