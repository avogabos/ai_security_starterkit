Dear Team,

 

August was both a quiet and an eventful month.

 

Firstly I shall address the subject of Bernard. As you are all aware he no longer is working us. This was a mutual decision and we wish him all the luck in the future. As a matter of HR policy, all email and web accounts Bernard would have had access to have undergone a password reset. I may also remind you that our business, clients and internal affairs are strictly private and should never be shared outside of the company or with previous employees. 

 

Secondly, August was a very quiet month due to various holidays etc. Going into September I hope everyone has renewed vigour and will focus on the key products we push often. 

 

The Formations House website has had a revamp and will be live next week. We will be able to use 3D secure for Amex checkout which more or less eliminates the use of the manual charge forms from now on. 

The Hong Kong additional pricing for upgrade services will be added, and a couple of LLP accounting solutions will also be ready.

 

We have 42 readymade LLP companies all filed and up to date. These are great to sell to anyone who wants to show a company with some trading history as with an LLP we can show trading history easily with some profits but with negated tax implications. I shall be providing credit reports on a couple of these next week which will represent the credit reports for all. pricing will start at £7.5k.

 

we have many enquiries for the Ready Made with bank account however we have not closed any of these even though the price has been flexible. Let us focus on shifting a couple of these companies. 

Please also slow on selling Managing Companies right now as we don't have anyone who can act as Nominee and many of the clients approaching us want solutions that we would not consider safe to offer.

 

On the banking side, please bear in mind all banks want an apostile of the corporate documents and it is only Rietumu that does not want the ID docs notarised.

 

As Mr Qamar is away from next week and staff generally low, we may have to be more considerate about the bank application processing time. currently I am the only one who can do them which is a problem as I have little time as it is and I want to find new partners to offer for banking. So as I say, when discussing the applications with clients be realistic in adding a few extra processing days. 

 

In regards to Sales and tagging. we should not have many issues now with customers being tagged but when a problem arises I expect the sales parties involved to be considerate of each other and if my advice is sought please bear in mind I will make a decision and stick to it and I may not explain my choices. I will try to remain fair where possible but in some cases one party will feel my decision is unfair. Bear in mind that everything swings in roundabouts and patience, tolerance and dedication are what we need to move forward.

 

Rebecca will be leaving us at the end of this month, and it is with great sadness in one hand that she leaves us but great joy when we consider the reason. Over the next few weeks please do not put too many tasks onto her plate, and allow her to remove herself from the business carefully. 

 

With the many changes in Support, I would like to also announce a piece of positive news. Rachel (Preet) has worked incredibly hard over the last few months and has shown she is highly capable of managing the Support Team. From this month she is appointed as Head of Support and will work with Rizwan to ensure her team provide a high level of assistance to the Sales Team. Shawn passed the probationary period last month and we will now be relying on his skills to replace Rebecca’s tasks before she leaves. 

 

We will be hiring new support members and adverts are running.

 

Have a good month guys and as usual I am here to support you all in conjunction with Rizwan and Rachel.

 

 

 

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
