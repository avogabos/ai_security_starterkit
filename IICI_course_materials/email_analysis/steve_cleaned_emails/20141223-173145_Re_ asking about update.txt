Hello Steve!

Yes, Delphine sent me the scanned copies already.

I need to receive on my German address the company papers in original
though, right?

or better asked what is next step from the registration procedure?

Best regards,

Rozalia

Hello, Steve!
Thank you for taking care of me and updating me what is
going on
with the registration of my Honk Kong Company!
I have forwarded to you the last two mails sent to Delphine,
without any answer, nor update.
Pls let me know about the status of the registration.
Thank you in advance for your time and efforts.
Best regards,
