Barker: “I wouldn’t do the mansion tax myself”
The Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reports on remarks made by former MPC member Kate Barker that increases pressure on Labour to provide more details on their mansion tax proposals. Ms Barker says the tax could be “very disruptive” to the housing market. Speaking to the Huffington Post, Ms Barker said: “It may be a bit difficult to feel terribly sorry about the effects of house prices as they have risen so rapidly. However, you should be reasonably careful about introducing a tax that would be very disruptive. I wouldn’t do the mansion tax myself.” Elsewhere, the Telegraph notes how it wouldn’t just be Conservative grandees who would be hit by a tax on homes worth £2m or more. Labour’s Hilary Benn, Harriet Harman, Emily Thornberry, Margaret Hodge and Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper would all be at risk from their own annual charge, the paper says. Separately, the Times’ Anne Ashworth warns that the mansion tax could eventually affect those with homes worth far less than £2m. She cites James Hender, of Saffery Champness, who sees the ATED (annual tax on enveloped dwellings) as the model for the mansion tax. From April 2016, the charge, which is paid by owners of residences worth £2m stashed in offshore companies, will apply to those worth £500,000. Finally, the Mail carries comments from experts who predict the anticipated £1.2bn gains from a mansion tax would be wiped out by sellers lowering the price of their homes and costs associated with running a new valuation department.

MPs call for tax breaks for stay-at-home mothers
The Conservative MPs Jeremy Lefroy, Fiona Bruce, John Glen and Caroline Spelman, are urging David Cameron to consider new tax breaks for full-time carers and mothers who stay at home. They warn that the introduction of tax breaks for child care have created a "disparity" between couples who both work full time and families in which one parent stays at home to raise the children. Meanwhile, Andrew Tyrie has called for North Sea oil and gas revenues to be passed directly to Holyrood along with much greater control over tax and spending, in return for cuts in taxpayer funded subsidies to Scotland.

US firms disadvantaged by new inversion rules
New rules proposed by the US Treasury will put foreign firms buying American companies at an advantage over their US rivals. So-called “inversions” by US firms will be discouraged by making it harder for them to access cash held offshore. However, the rules will not apply to foreign firms – a move tax experts have described as “unfair and inappropriate”. Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor and former Treasury lawyer, said: “It shouldn’t matter whether the new [corporate] structure comes in the form of a new foreign acquirer or an inverted transaction. The fact is there is attempted avoidance of US tax on the offshore earnings either way.”

Tesco’s internal controls questioned
In light of Tesco’s recent accounting mis-statement, the Economist explores how the misrecording of revenues generally falls into one of two categories: booking revenues earned in one quarter forward or backward into another one, and fake sales. Tesco’s promotional deals with suppliers will have provided room for error, deliberate distortion and discretion, the piece suggests, noting how the auditors of several big retailers have warned over recent years of the risk of manipulation of rebates, including PwC, which pointed to this risk in its May report for Tesco. The magazine suggests that the retailers’ internal controls need “a thorough overhaul”, regardless of whether fraud was intended or if there was just a misunderstanding of the rules. Separately, the Mail notes that Tesco executives and possibly also PwC could be brought in front of the Commons business committee to answer questions over Tesco’s overstating of profits. Deloitte and Freshfields have been hired by Tesco to investigate.

No place like home?
The FT’s Maxine Boersma examines the problem of filling accounting roles globally, noting how Malaysia needs approximately 60,000 accountants to meet its goal of becoming a high income nation by 2020 and is encouraging Malaysian accountants to return home with a cut in income tax from 25% to 15%. Andrew Robb, a director in the Global Mobility Transformation practice at Deloitte UK, says: “Recent reports have stated that accountancy is currently one of the top-10 hardest jobs to fill, globally.” Uganda encourages expats to actively invest in their home country while Pakistan lures them home with private gated and serviced housing schemes. But, despite efforts by many countries, the global urge to relocate shows no sign of ebbing, writes Ms Boersma, who cites a 2012 ACCA survey of nearly 2,000 accountants across Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, which revealed 82% of respondents were interested in overseas secondments.

Steep drop in graduate unemployment
The Higher Education Careers Service Unit (Hescu) has revealed that there has been a big fall in graduate unemployment in the UK. Hescu analysed the destinations of 256,350 new graduates six months after they left university. It found that 7.3% were unemployed in January 2014, down from 8.5% in January 2013 and the lowest level since 2008. The figures, published jointly with the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, suggest 70% of new graduates were in employment by January 2014. The researchers also found that more graduates were in professional and managerial work - 66.3% of new graduates, compared with 64.9% the previous year.

Revenues grow at EY
Advisory revenues at EY were up 14.4% to $6.5bn in the year to June 30 with all four main lines of the firm’s business growing in the period. Total revenues grew 6.8% to $27.4bn with the most profitable sectors being public sector, life sciences, healthcare, technology and banking. Emerging markets proved the fastest-growing part of EY’s business. Mark Weinberger, global chairman and CEO, said: “Emerging markets will continue to drive economic growth for the foreseeable future.” Mr Weinberger commented that the profession is facing challenges to its business at a macro level, where “geopolitical issues and nationalism are popping up as countries protect local industries [ . . .] or enact local regulations to improve their financial situation.”

Tories must demonstrate business support
The Telegraph’s Allister Heath calls on the Conservatives to seize the moment and prove they are the party for business and entrepreneurs. Mr Heath says businesses are worried in the wake of the Scottish referendum and the Labour party conference and that the Conservatives should offer strong pro-growth policies, support airport expansion in the south east and make clear that a pure Tory government would cut red tape radically and further cut incentive-destroying taxes.

Money challenge as more reach 100
Analysts have said that policymakers face “huge challenges” in financing an ageing population, as centenarian numbers in the UK hit a new record high. The ONS said there were an estimated 13,780 people aged 100 and over in the UK in 2013, up from 3,040 in 1983. It also predicted that the number will rise to 33,989 in 10 years’ time, and then quicken to 83,940 a decade after that. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, commented: “Planning the transition from work to retirement needs to accommodate the expectation that at the age of 70, many of us will have another 20 or 30 years to live. The two most effective ways to deal with this are to work later and save more; neither of which is going to be universally popular, but there are not any easy answers to this challenge.”

ECONOMY

Time for interest rate rise getting closer
Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that Britain’s economy is now strong enough to handle an interest rate rise, although any increase will be “gradual and limited”. Despite the economy having “normalised” – with the strongest G7 growth, rising employment and inflation falling below target – the “headwinds facing the economy are likely to take some time to die down”, Mr Carney said. “With many of the conditions for the economy to normalise now met, the point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer,” he told an actuarial conference in Wales. “While there is always uncertainty about the future, you can expect interest rates to begin to increase. We have no pre-set course, however; the timing will depend on the data.”
