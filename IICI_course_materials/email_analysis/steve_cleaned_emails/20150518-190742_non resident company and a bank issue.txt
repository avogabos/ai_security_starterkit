Steve,

Following our conversation, can you help me to understand what do i need to open a company in UK with a British bank account?

The point is as follows: I run a company here in Russia that import industrial pumps from UK and sales it to local end customer. I need to have a British company that would sell the pumps to my company in Russia. And this British company will buy the pumps from an offshore company in Asia.

Can I open such a company in UK with British bank and with nominee director and a shareholder? How much will be the whole package?

Thank you for a prompt answer.

Best regards,
Eugene
