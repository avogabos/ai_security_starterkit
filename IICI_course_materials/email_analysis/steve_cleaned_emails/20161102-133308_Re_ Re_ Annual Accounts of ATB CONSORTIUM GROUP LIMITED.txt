Re: Re: Annual Accounts of ATB CONSORTIUM GROUP LIMITED
Dear Steve,
Client asked me maybe you already have recived tax reference
number for
ATB CONSORTIUM GROUP?
9 working days have passed. You were writing 7-10 working
days
but client asked me so much to write and ask you...
He wishes to pay corporate tax
as soon as possible.
And besides tax reference number, while paying corporate tax
сlient should write correct financial period of accounts.
Could you please write me what should he writes there as correct financial
period?
"financial year ended January 31st, 2016" or "financial
period from 1st of Febuary 2015 to
31st of January, 2016"? I am afraid to advice him any
wrong information because he really is very nervous most of the time, call to
us and shout etc. That's why i want give him all information and make him
calm till next order ))
Thank you!
Best wishes,
Ekaterina.
