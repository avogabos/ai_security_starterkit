Dear formations house

thanks for letting me know that my company has been formed. But I still 
have a few questions.

Now that I have the company - what's next? Do I have to hold an initial 
meeting and keep the minutes? If yes, then what should the meeting be 
about? And the shares - will I receive share certificates from you, or 
should I print any myself, or what are my obligations?

In addition to the above two questions - is there anything else I am 
obliged to do now for the company? Or can I just start acquiring 
customers under the name of the company and start providing my services? 
And can I already purchase things in the name of the company (not much, 
just the translations software I need)?

Also, I purchased the Value Accounting. How does this work? Should I 
simply register all income and expenditure in an Excel sheet, and at the 
end of the year send you that Excel sheet and the scans of all invoices, 
or will you send me some software I should use to enter those data?

And I also purchased the webhosting. I've seen where I can register a 
Domain. Once that has been done, how and where do I upload the website I 
want to have? And what are the requirements for that website? Can I just 
create something in Dreamweaver, or are there any particular 
requirements regarding page formats and folder structure?

When I register a Domain and want to create/use email addresses under 
that domain, what do I have to do to create the email addresses, and 
what are the data of the mailserver smtp and pop I can use to send and 
receive my emails from?

A lot of questions, apologies for this! Basically I need a heads up what 
I am obliged to do next, and how I can use the options I purchased 
together with the company formation.

Thanks for letting me know!

Kind regards

Joachim Trensz
