HI Steve,
 
Thank you kindly for your help with this.
 
One final question I have with respect to the lodging of accounts with Companies House, do you know if they offer any sort of 'urgent' service with respect to lodging the accounts? 
 
Many thanks,
 
James

Hi James

you think it is fine, then kindly submit it to Companies House by post.

 

We have

records.

 

Regarding price
of filing amended accounts since you have paid GBP 300 for value accounting
service, we will use the this amount for this process.

Hi Steve,

 

I have been dealing with Delphine with respect to setting up a premade company.
There are a couple of points that I would like to confirm with respect to the
company please, as follows:

 

- The registered address has been updated but not the change of company
name, we requested this to be changed to ATS Worldwide. Can you please
advise if there is anything further I need to do for this to be actioned?

 

- The SIC code also hasn't been updated, can you please update this
to 62012?

 

- Finally she has provided us with the amended accounts for the
company, these are all correct except for the registered address for the
company is showing as my personal address, not the actual address which
is:

 

2 PUDDLE DOCK 

BLACKFRIARS 

LONDON 

ENGLAND 

EC4V 3BB

 

Also with the accounts, can you please confirm what the cost is for these? I had
been quoted £500 for this when I was referred to Formations House for
the company set up.

 

Many thanks for your help.

 

James Neville
