Hi Raj,

It's now almost a year since our first meeting at RBS, however we are not even close to opening the bank account.

We are working on deal that should be closed by the end of the February and we need a bank account in order to register for VAT and to deposit the money.

Can we arrange lunch meeting to sort everything out and get this account opened.

Regards
