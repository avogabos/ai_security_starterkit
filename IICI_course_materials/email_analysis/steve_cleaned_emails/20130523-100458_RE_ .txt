Couple of things,

 

The nominee director does not sign to enable them to open the bank account
as this leads to serious issues about company legal and security, we have to
sell a managed company.

 

If they are happy for that to be removed, then you need to find out if they
need the power of attorney notarised or apostilised, as the nominee director
would have to go to the notary for this.

 

Let me know

 

Attached is the POA for nominee director

Hi

 

 

I need your help.

 

 

I have made power attorney for the first time. Can you please check if they
are okay?

 

 

Also advice that customer is using our nominee director, so who would sign
the documents?

 

 

Regards
