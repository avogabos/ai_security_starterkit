Hi Steve,
This is Nasrin Akbari from Sweden. Referring to the phone call earlier today together with my friend Sean about the registration of a company in UK, here I am sending you an email in order to get the information you gave us by that phone call.

What is important for me is:
Registration fee and the time lines and what is included
Mail handling and having an address
What to think and what is necessary to do in order to have it VAT registered and how long does it take? Can it be done later on?
What information or documents you need for the purpose of registering a company for me in UK
How can we have the directors name anonymous?
To have a bank account for the company , what is the fee if you do that vs the director do it on site directly at a UK based bank?

Grateful for any further information

BR
