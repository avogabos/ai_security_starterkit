Dear Steve,

But there could be a usual Resolution (as a corporate document which shall
be) that previous director appointed a current one and it is acceptable for
us to include under this Apostille the Form IN 01 (Form 10) together with
the Resolution of dismissing and appointed similar to the attached one.

Kindly advice where it is possible from your side?

With best regards,
Ekaterina

Dear Steve,
But there could be a usual Resolution (as a corporate document which shall be) that previous director appointed a current one and it is acceptable for us to include under this Apostille the Form IN 01 (Form 10) together with the Resolution of dismissing and appointed similar to the attached one.
Kindly advice where it is possible from your side?
With best regards,
Ekaterina

Dear

No there is
no other document which can be included in Apostille to show current director.
If it would
have been new company registration then Form IN 01 (Form 10) is sufficient but
for readymade companies Certificate of Good Standing is confirmation of appointment
from authority.
Just an
advice, till the documents are ready in meantime other party can verify
director appointment directly on government website
www.companieshouse.gov.uk
or
www.gov.uk/government/
organisations/companies-house
Please
advice whether we include CoGS (Certificate of Good Standing) in Apostille or
not?

Dear Ekaterina
The reason Certificate of Good
Standing is offered to clients who purchase readymade companies is because it
is the only document issued by company registrar which confirms current
director details.
If you wish we will not add it with
Apostille documents and as soon as it is available will send you the scanned
copy and deliver it with Apostille documents in which Certitifcate of Good
Standig will not be Apostilled.
Please advice.

Certificate Good Standing (Express) which will be delivered by company
registrar within 5 working days, once we have the good standing certificate we
will start Apostille (Express) process which will take another 5 working days.

Dear Ekaterina,
This document seems perfect and
everything else is in place therefore hopefully INFO PATH LTD will be ready
tomorrow by end of day and company documents will be available.
Sorry for the delays, but I hope you
remember that in my first email to you we clearly mentioned “Once we have the order
with correct details, documents and payment, company will be transferred within
2 working days.” That is why in every email we mention specifically and point
out each document which is required to avoid delays.
Anyways now it seems that everything
is in order so hopefully company will be ready for you in 24 hours.
If you require further information
or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone or by live chat on our
website.
