Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
As we have already informed you that the amount of your companyâ€™s shares is quite significant and therefore it cannot be e-filed i.e. you need to post the accounts manually. Also, active (not dormant) company accounts have been prepared and will be submitted as there has been a change in share capital structure compared to previous year and the company is out of the scope of being dormant.
Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.
Regards,
Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
