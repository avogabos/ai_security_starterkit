Hi Steve


The new payroll service is still sorting out our PAYE -  they have now asked the following of us


The action required is as follows:

  *   You (or your previous provider) should log on to your online services PAYE account via the Government Gateway.
  *   Download any outstanding HMRC messages.
  *   Forward all downloaded messages to Chris Foot for action.
  *   Switch the Internet options to NO on the Notice Options screen.

Is this something you are able to do, or let me know the URL Link and log on details so I can do this.


Thanks

Chris
