If using a managed service, the beneficial owner is not listed as a
shareholder in the UK as this would effect the bank status

However, with our managed services we provide a Trust Deed, which can be
notarised if needed. On this document we can list the seycheles company

For our Due Diligence and MLR, we would require the apostile of the
Seychelles company and the ID of the director, however this information is
not disclosed unless expressly requested by the UK authorities

UKPR LTD + Bank Account & UK Managed Service - 11000 GBP (final)

 

He wants 2 business solutions

 

He says this:

 

 

First of all I would like to proceed with company UKPR. 

 

Next point - I already have Seychelles Company and would like to use this
company as a Beneficial Owner of new UK Company, is it possible? 

 

In the same time, I definitely don't want to provide my own director or
shareholder, so nominee director and shareholder services are still
required. 

 

The only question is can I use Seychelles Company as a beneficial owner or I
have to disclose the name of private person who is behind this Seychelles
Company?
