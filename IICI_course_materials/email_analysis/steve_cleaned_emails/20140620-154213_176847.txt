Hi

I have been having some issues with Company names, and now things are
getting a bit desperate as I am seriously behind schedule.

Therefore I would like to go with Hypertel Limited, I would like to fast
track this with Formationshouse and I would like some info on what you
offer in terms of Bank Account assistance.

Please can you give me a call when your meeting is over, on 07977041730 so
that we can discuss and I can transfer the extra funds required

Many Thanks

Steve
