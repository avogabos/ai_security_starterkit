Hi Steve

Thanks for this information.

I have some questions.

1. What email address do they have for the customer details for this bank
account.
2. I see the details of how to deposit money, but what about getting
on-line access to the account, how do we do this.
3. I presume all this information is mailed to us, what address will this
go to.
4. When we contact the bank, I presume it should be from the email address
from question 1 and not my email address, is this correct.
5. We also don't have any detail about withdrawing money, what is this
procedure.

If we need to contact the bank directly about these questions then please
just provide the answer to question 1 and we will do the rest.

Many thanks
Chris
