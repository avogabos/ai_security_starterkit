Hello Guys, 

PSC (Person with significant control)

Companies (Limited by shares and Limited by guarantee) and LLPs will now
need to keep a register of people with significant control ('PSC
register').Companies registered from 30th June 2016 should provide PSC
details (Person with significant control), person who holds ownership and
has a right to take any action or to make any changes for e.g.: appointment,
termination etc.

On incorporation, there will be someone who will count as a person with
significant control (either a registered person or a person who has relation
to the company.

The option to provide PSC details is available on our website at the time of
placing order for UK Company formation. For now client can only select
director or secretary to act as a PSC for the company, but once the system
is live, client can have as many PSC's they want.



Confirmation Statement (Annual Returns):

For existing companies, PSC information will need to be submitted on the
first confirmation statement (which will replace the annual return form)
that it files after the 30th June. [Unless it's a private company which
elects to keep information from the PSC register on the public register; in
which case it will need to send PSC information (and any updates to that
information) on an event-driven basis].

We have also updated our system for filing confirmation statement after 30th
June and following statement is available in customer's account:

By June 30 2016 Annaul Return will be replaced by Confirmation Statement.

If you require any further assistance do not hesitate to contact me.

Best Regards,
