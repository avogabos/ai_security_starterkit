The answers are as follows to the following queries.

 

1.       You need to contact HMRC as we do not assist in making payments to
the Government authorities.

2.       Authorization code has already been used accordingly. Kindly
discard the letter now.

3.       Kindly provide us the details of the employee so that we may
incorporate it into the system

4.       Please note that we have made the final submission of your LLP's
payroll for the previous tax year 2014/15 which included the month of March.
Your new payroll will begin from April. We will provide you with the
software details, which you will be able to use in order to generate
payslips of your employees for the month of April 2015 and so on.

Hi Steve

 

Sorry for the late reply.

 

We would like to go ahead with this payroll service - can you please tell me
the next steps.

 

I know there are some things outstanding.

 

1. We need to pay the Tax/NI you calculated for last year - how do we do
this.

2. We had a letter from HMRC regarding a code that needs to be entered by
our Payroll partner (you) by today July 24th. - do you have this code or do
I have to formally sent it to you. It was included on an email to me

3. We have a couple more people to go on the payroll - how do you want to
set them up.

4. We have been paying salary to 2 people from March what information do you
need from me about them.

 

Thanks

Chris

Hi Chris

 

Hope you are doing well.

 

You must have received a response from our accounting team regarding

To use the full service for PAYE in which we will prepare the payslips and
file returns etc, the service will cost GBP 1500 per annum if employees are
3 or less than 3. Using the service, at month end you will need to provide
information on amount of salary paid each month to each employee, so that we
can prepare payslips and file returns.

 

Please note that this service is not advertise on our website, because we
provide this service to very specific customers.

 

Regards

 

Steve

Hi

 

Thank you, but do you mean you will be filing them as well or is this
something I have to do.

 

You say 'contact HMRC as informed' - what am a supposed to say.

 

Can you confirm that you will be acting as a full PAYE service or not.

 

Chris
