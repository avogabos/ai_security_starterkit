Hello,

I'd like to do a UK Global Company registration. 

We are looking to offer small and medium size business funding and investment services via our web platform. The platform basically will connect small and large investors with innovative entrepreneurs who require funding for their businesses and in return the entrepreneurs agree to pay dividends to those investors who have invested in their ventures.

We work in collaboration with a long established international organisation and we have a management team that has extensive investment experience
and is composed of professional men and women of proven integrity and excellent
track records whose vast backgrounds serve as a rich resource base for our overall business successes.

We would require a merchant account to accept investment funds on behalf of entrepreneurs listed on our web platform. Others tools we will be offering on our web platform to make transactions secure, swift and flawless include third party e-money, e-wallet, prepaid debit cards and money transfer services.

I'd like to request you advise on other registration requirements like licensing, etc as well as costs. 

We will also be requiring access to our bank account via the internet and will like to be able to access funds at anytime and from any location.

I look forward to your response.

Regards,
