Hi

 

I just wish to know what your terms are for a company in the Gambia and for
a bank account in the Gambia or other cheap alternative regions

 

Also if you have a comprehensive list of all offshore locations, wheather
filling reports is mandetory, the cost of bank accounts and if they can be
accessed over the internet. 

 

Thanks, 

 

Gold
