Thank you Steve…

Can you please change that (2) to (0) on the website cause we have got it wrong…(same for the business cards but never mind I will print more later…)

I did try calling it myself right now and all I get is a busy tone…still does not work.

Pls advise…

Thank you again…

Dear Steve,
Please be kind enough to let me know of the correct
fax number
of my virtual office since some people are trying to fax something over to +44 (2) 2071827792 to no avail because the message they get is that the number does not exist.
The telephone works perfectly I checked it myself.
Thank you in advance for your help.
