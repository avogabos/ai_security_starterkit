Dear Sir/Madam

 

FABRICE DANGANY LIMITED - 08141534

 

Thank you for your enquiry of 29/05/2017 concerning the restoration of the above company.

 

The company was struck off the register for non-filing of statutory documentation.

 

There are two procedures for restoring a companies to the register, which are:

                - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)

                - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

 

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

 

1) RT01 form, with a filing fee of 100.

 

2) The BV waiver letter. This can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

 

3) Annual Returns for the dates of 12/07/2013, 12/07/2014, and 12/07/2015 with a £40 filing fee for each.

 

4) Confirmation Statement for the date of 12/07/2016 and £40 filing fee.

 

4) Accounts for the periods ending 31/07/2013, 31/07/2014, 31/07/2015 and 31/07/2016.

 

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

 

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8), and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed
  from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court.

 

Information regarding this can be obtained from the Government Legal Departments website https://www.gov.uk/guidance/company-restoration-guide
  or http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk

 

If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you
  may use the same name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

 

Yours faithfully

 

R Bradshaw
