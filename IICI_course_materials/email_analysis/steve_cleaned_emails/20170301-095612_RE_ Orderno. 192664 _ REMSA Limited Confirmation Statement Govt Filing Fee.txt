Dear Steve,
I have verified for the Remsa that the Confirmation Statement is done and correct, but in the meantime the Company House has registered the First Notice for compulsory of strike off, for the delay of the confirmation statement (
https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09131003/filing-history
)
We must do something?
Regards
Andrea
