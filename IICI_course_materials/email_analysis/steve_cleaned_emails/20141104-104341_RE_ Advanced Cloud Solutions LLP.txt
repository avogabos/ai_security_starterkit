In our case no one has invested money in the LLP only the cost of the shares - so I presume that is £1 each.

Hi Talal,

 

Members capital means that how much contribution each partner has done in the partnership at the start of it. Contribution is the initial investment which can be cash brought in a business or any asset brought in a business.
