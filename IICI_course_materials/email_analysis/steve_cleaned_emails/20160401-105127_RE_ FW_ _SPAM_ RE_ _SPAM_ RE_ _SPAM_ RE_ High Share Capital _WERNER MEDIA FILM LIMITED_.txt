Fahad and Umair

 

Yesterday I sent Account Centre following email to confirm that H&T PORTFOLIO MANAGERS LIMITED has already paid for DCA filing because Account Centre sent an email to client to remind them on filing dates for H&T PORTFOLIO MANAGERS LIMITED.

 

Why account centre is replying me as that I am a client?

 

Please inform staff that steve@formationshouse.com is not a client and I should only be get copy of message that is being sent to actual client.

 

Thank you.

Dear Accounts Centre

thanks for the email, as you can read below I have paid the  Express Dormant Account

for the H&T PORTFOLIO MANAGERS LIMITED the 14th March. You can contact Steve about. 

In anycase it is important to do it very quickly  to avoid penalties from the HMRC.

In the case there is a misunderstanding from my side and it was not paid you are authorized

to take the payment from my advance payment. 

Regards

Andrea
