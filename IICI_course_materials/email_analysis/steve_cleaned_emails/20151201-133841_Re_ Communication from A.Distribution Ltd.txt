Dear Steve,

Thank you for your answer. I know that I ask you some basilar
informations, but our accounting, Mr Alfredo Barbanelli keep in touch
with you, and I don't have a lot informations about our contract with
Formations House.

I provide immediately to communicate your request about my
authorization to operate to our office in Italy.
I would like to ask you some informations about the other service that
your business offers on payment.

Thank you for your availability

Best Regards

Simonetta Stabile
