Dear Sir

Re: I 20 SITI LIMITED       No. 8867758

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file the following documents and fees:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual returns for 29 January 2015 and 29 January 2016, with a filing fee of £40.00 per form.

3) Accounts for the period ending 31 January 2015. There are no late filing penalties for these accounts as they became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

4) A waiver letter from the Government Legal Department, which can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

Yours faithfully
