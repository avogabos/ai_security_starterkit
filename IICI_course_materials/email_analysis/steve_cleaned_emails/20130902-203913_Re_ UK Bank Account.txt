Hi Steve

Another couple of weeks have gone by and still no news about the bank
accounts.

Please let me know ASAP what is going on.

We need to start trading this month.

Regards
Chris

Hi Steve
Thanks for the response, but this was the same response from
Charlotte more than 2 weeks ago.
Is there something wrong that we need to address
Why is it taking so long

Dear
Chris
We
are waiting for the bank to update us on account opening and as soon as we have
the account number we process the VAT Registration.
Please
note that it is necessary to provide bank account number for VAT registration.
We
will update you soon.
Regards
Steve

Hi
Charlotte
Thanks
for your time the other day, we both found it very useful.
Do
you have any update regarding the UK Bank Account/VAT registration.
We
have a current client that is being billed from another company and we are very
keen to move them over to ACS,
So
we really need everything setup in order for this to happen.
I
should also be hand delivering Anthony''s bank forms this afternoon.
Thanks
Chris
