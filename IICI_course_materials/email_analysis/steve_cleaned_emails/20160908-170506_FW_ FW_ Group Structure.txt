Dear Clare, 

 

My apologies since the 2nd of this month I have had technical issues and could not access my emails until today. I do apologise! 

 

I have forwarded your enquiry to my colleague Oliver who is the head of sales. I hope he will be able to update you later on today. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya

FAO – Nadia,

 

Thank you for your assistance on the phone.

 

We require the help of your services for our looking to move to a group company structure.  I hope the attached excel sheets help to illustrate the proposed structure.


Could you kindly let us know how much it would cost for your assistance, a holding company is to be formed, together with a second subsidiary company, all relevant resolutions and articles regarding changes to shares and structure.

 

I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Clare.
