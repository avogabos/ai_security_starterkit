Re: Company ID 8138444
Steve,
Here is the most recent correspondence from HMRC - as received from Formations House - note - one page we received was blank.  I was just able to transmit the fax requesting waiver of the fees yesterday.
It is apparent from this latest correspondence that they are identifying two different accounting periods for the 2009 year end:
Jan 28, 2009 thru Jan 27, 2010 - the 2009 tax year
and
Jan 28, 2010 thru Jan 31, 2010 - three days in 2010??
Providing, of course, they grant the request for waiver, this is not an issue.  However, I would like to know how they determine a three day tax year in 2010?  (unless they figure that since nothing was ever filed on time for this company that is out of business?)
Please keep me informed of your  Accounting Team's research.  And, please update me on the status of the gateway pin.  After the confusion and mis-information surrounding our UTR for two years, I am concerned that this is another issue that will go unresolved.  Specifically, it concerns me that you are working on this, your Accounting Team is working on this, yet we still get his correspondence forwarded to us randomly from Support with no acknowledgement that someone from Formations House should already be aware of this long standing issue.  Someone should have our entire file and be able to follow this problem from the beginning.  The truth is had we been provided the UTR when we requested it, and as we were told we would be, none of this would be happening.
I realize that this isn't even really your issue, but that you are the only one who has managed to make any progress on this.  Please advise if there is someone on the Accounting Team who does have our file, who is familiar with it, and if I should be contacting that person directly
Thank you,
Stefanie

In the mean time you can send the attached letter to HMRC by fax on this number, 0044-207-667-2594. Letter is for requesting HMRC to waive all the penalties.
And I will send you the online gateway pin for HMRC as soon as it is received.
Regards,
Steve

Re: Company ID 8138444
Steve,
We have just received the attached communication from HMRC.  It looks like we have been assessed an additional £100 for each Accounting Period, so now we are up to £400 total due:  £200 for each year.  Though I am confused by the dates of the reporting periods on these notices:
One letter and corresponding reconciliation statement lists the Account Period from 28 January 2009 to 27 January 2010
The other set of correspondence lists the Accounting Period from 28 January 2010 to 31 January 2010
Are they really asking for a return to be filed for the three days from 28 Jan to 31 Jan 2010? Why are they specifying Accounting Periods which are really the same periods:  year ending Jan 2010?
According to FedEx tracking, they received the tax return for the period ending 31 Jan 2010 on 25 May.   These notices are dated 18 May.
What is the status of obtaining online access?  Once you get this access information, please forward it to me so that I can go online, as well.  These notices indicate that I can access further details on their website.  I need to get this resolved before we incur any more charges.  Before I can write requesting a waiver of these penalties, I need to understand what they are for.
Thank you,
Stefanie
