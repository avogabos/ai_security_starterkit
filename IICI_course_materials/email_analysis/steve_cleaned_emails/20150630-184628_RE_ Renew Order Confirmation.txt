Dear Steve.

 

Thank you for invoice, I found this order in my account on your website… I thought that I already paid this service for this year….(?). Please, would you be so kind and could you possibly send alerts directly to the invoice for payment for the new service is required to my email?

 

But I have one question: I need established new company through my account in http://www.formationshouse.com/. What can I do for it?

 

Thank you for your cooperation.

 

Best regards
