officially it is only alexandria Dobosn which will be what cert is for
right?

Phil,
The
reason we are asking to generate incumbency certificate after you do the change
is because document contains information on company director and shareholder as
well. Therefore if we arrange the document and then you make changes in company
information, can rise a conflict with party to whom you will submit the
document.
As
per your email below, we will submit the request for incumbency after 1 hour
from now and for any reason you still want to put it on hold then please email
us back within 1 hour.
Regards
Steve

Dear Mr Dobson,
Thank you very much for your email.
I have taken a look through the email and may I check if you
have the Certificate of Incumbency as well?
For the verification in London, I will definitely be able to
assist to arrange for the appointment.  However, with regards to the
signing of the documents, your daughter will have to sign as well since she is
the sole director. She will be required to pass a Standard Bank’s Resolution to
appoint yourself as the authorised person and signatory of the account. As such,
we will need both yourself and your daughter to sign the documents.
Our office will be closed on 1 Oct 2015 due to a company event
and there will be no access to our email. Business resumes on Monday 5 Oct
2015, and I will revert to you when I am back.
