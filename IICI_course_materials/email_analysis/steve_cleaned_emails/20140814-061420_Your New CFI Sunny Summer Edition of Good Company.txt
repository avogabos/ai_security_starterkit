More good news about Ireland
Dublin -
the home of CFI
- has been voted one of the friendliest cities on the planet and is rapidly rising in the friendliness rankings.
Ireland's famed capital city is ranked fifth in the top 10 of the world's most welcoming urban destinations, by readers of Conde Nast Traveller.
Rapidly moving up eight places from the position of being the 13th most friendly city last year, it shares its coveted ranking with Sydney, Australia - the home of so many Irish people living overseas.
The top spots included Auckland, New Zealand; Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; and Charleston in South Carolina, US.
Only two European cities made it into the top 10 - the other being Seville in Spain.
Dublin is described as a 'vibrant city' and, in a nod to its literary fame it is also described as a 'bibliophile's dream'.
The top ten list is as follows:
1. Auckland,
New Zealand
2. Melbourne,
Australia
3. Victoria,
BC, Canada
4. Charleston,
South Carolina, US
5. Dublin,
Ireland
5. Sydney,
Australia
7. Siem Reap,
Cambodia
8. Cape Town,
South Africa
9. Savannah,
Georgia, US
10. Seville,
Spain
Dublin was also noted for being 'green, lush and very walkable' and 'the kind of place you stop in for a drink in a local pub, only to end up chatting with the locals for the next five hours'.
The magazine also references US first lady Michelle Obama's trip to Dublin with her daughters last year when she was photographed with Bono at his local pub.
Niall Gibbons
, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, said the city's high ranking came as no surprise.
'Again and again, our research shows us that the friendliness of our people is one of our unique selling points,' he said.
'It is the warm welcome and the 'craic' here that resonates with our overseas visitors and makes Dublin and Ireland such a great choice for a short break or holiday.
What it all adds up to is that you are in great company in Dublin - the home of CFI, of course!
Issue:
Sunny Summer 2014
Dear Steve
Isn't summer in Ireland wonderful?
Sunshine, sports, music, festivals, flowers and above all...
good company!
It's a great place to be. And it's one of the reasons why more and more business owners and leading brands from all over the world are looking to Ireland to form companies.
And, of course, so many of them are using CFI for their very specific company formation requirements.
That's why in this special Sunny Summer edition of
Good Company
from CFI we have a wealth of different things to share with you... from a fascinating video by
Simon Anholt
telling you about his quest to find the country that does the most good for the world
(the answer will surprise you, especially if you live in the US or China)
to six short sunny summer stories for you to enjoy yourself and share with others in your company.
We also have a great competition for you with an opportunity to win €200 for you to buy two tickets to your favourite sporting event.
If you have any questions about any of the matters covered in this Sunny Summer edition of Good Company you are very welcome to contact either Joanne Browne at
Joanne@formation.ie
or myself or
Sean@formations.ie
.
We'll always be delighted to hear from you.
Enjoy Good Company!
Kindest regards
Sean Kavanagh
Managing Director
Simon Anholt:
Which country does the most good for the world?
It's an unexpected side effect of globalization: events that once would have stayed local- say, a new company being formed in Ireland - now have consequences worldwide. But still, countries operate independently, as if alone on the planet. Policy advisor Simon Anholt has dreamed up an unusual scale to get governments thinking outwardly:
The Good Country Index
.
In a riveting and funny talk, he answers the question,
"Which country does the most good?"
The answer may surprise you (especially if you live in the US or China).

Six Short Summer Stories to bring you a Happy Summer Smile
To celebrate summer - and the glorious sunshine that's in it - CFI have put together 6-summer stories for your enjoyment and entertainment. These are stories for you to tell and share next time you are in
'Good Company'
having a pint... sharing a bar-b-que... enjoying a party... looking for a laugh.
Here's a taste of your first 'Good Company' story. Enjoy!
Those hazy summer days
A strong young man working on a construction site in Ireland kept bragging that he that could outdo anyone in a feat of strength. He made a special point of directing his remarks at a group of older construction workers.
"Nobody here is stronger than me," he boasted, "I am the strongest of all. I don't know why the boss bothers employing old weaklings like you. He should pay me double pay, because I am at least twice the strength of any one of you."
Day after day, this went on... I am the strongest, I am the fittest, I am the most able, I am more powerful than any of you ... boasted the young man. Until finally, one of the older workers decided that he had enough.
"Why don't you put your money where your mouth is," he challenged the younger man.
And pointing across to a small hut on the other side of the building site, he said "I bet you a week's pay that I can haul something over to that small hut in a wheelbarrow that you can't haul back."
