Dear Steve

The problem is that i can't contact the previous agent, who disappeared.
Is it mandatory to contact him? Or would a resolution from my company be enough for the gambian registry?
The articles of association do not specify that the previous agent must release the company...
Let me know and i will act accordingly.
Thanks a lot

Mario

Dear

We
can certainly manage the 2 existing Gambia companies but you will need to
transfer these companies to us. In order to do this you need to ask current
agent to write to iCommerceRegistry to release the companies and allow to
transfer companies to new agent Formations House.
Once
companies are released we can then take over the companies. The total cost for
the process will be:
-
Company
Transfer Fee (one time fee; for 2 companies) : GBP 50 x 2 = GBP 100
-
Gambia
Company Renewal : GBP 195 (per annum) x 2 = GBP 390
-
Total
: GBP 490
Please
advice how you wish to proceed.

Steve

Dear
Steve,
which
bank should i send the money to for the order of the gambian gbc2? Santander or
Barclays? I got instruction for both.
Also,
Zohra's offshore bank asked if you will provide a code to verify the
authenticity of the gambian documents on the gambian on line registry, not just
on your website:
http://verify.icommerceregistry.com/
Thanks
