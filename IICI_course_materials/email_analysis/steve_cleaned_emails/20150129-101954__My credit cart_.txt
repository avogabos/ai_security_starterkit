Dear Streve,

It has been 3 days since I asked Delphine send it to me.

 

As agreed by telephone, so I send you the address to which the VISA
Barclay's card must be sent again today:

 

Vinod Gunsbourg

65, avenue d'Oppem 

1950 Krainem Bruxelles 

Belgique

Tel: 0032 489 53 86 98

 

Thank you to send the credit card TODAY and send me the number followed by
recommending TODAY email.

 

I would like to receive the most urgent, the rest of my mail by email. We
just need the scanner.

 

Thank you for your understanding.

 

Warm regards,

 

Rodolphe de Pierpont,
