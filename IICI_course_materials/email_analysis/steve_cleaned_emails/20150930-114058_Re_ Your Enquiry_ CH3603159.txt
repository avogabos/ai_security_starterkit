Dear Sir

FORTUNE VENTURES WORLDWIDE LIMITED

Thank you for your e-mail dated 28 September 2015.

I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved because the annual return remained outstanding despite issuing a number of letters to the company at the address listed as the registered office including one sent via recorded delivery.  We also sent one letter to each of the directors at the address listed as their service address.

I can also confirm that the following documents and fees are required in order to apply for this company to be administratively restored to the register:

Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website.

Annual Return(s) (form(s) AR01) for 7 January 2015. This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40 and can also be downloaded from our website.

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64.

Please note that on 10th October 2015 the current version of the annual return will be replaced.  If this version of the return is received on or after the 10th October 2015 it will be rejected.

If you are unable to submit this return by this date, please download and complete the new version which will be available from our website ? www.companieshouse.gov.uk on 10th October 2015.

You should also be aware that accounts for the period ending 31 January 2015 are due by 31 October 2015.  If this company is not restored to the register by the due date, then this document will also be required in order for the company to be restored.


I hope this information has been of some use to you.

Yours faithfully
