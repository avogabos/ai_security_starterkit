We shall be refunding the fee for the LLP of £500.
As explained previously by Mrs Pawar, it is not possible to register a Sole Proprietor in the UK with Companies House. You have previously mentioned you would register a sole proprietorship outside of the EU where it is then possible to use a non EU Sole Proprietor as a Corporate Director.
We suggest as we have not charged anything additional, that you discuss the Sole Proprietor requirements with your new agent.
Your cheque will be posted today and you should have it this week.
