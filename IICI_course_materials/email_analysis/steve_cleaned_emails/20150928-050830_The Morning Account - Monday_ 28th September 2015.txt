McDonnell plans higher taxes for business and rich
John McDonnell looks set to use his first Labour conference speech as shadow chancellor to signal plans for a sharp rise in income tax, scrapping the Conservative IHT reforms and increasing corporation tax. Wealth should be distributed more fairly between different social groups and away from the South-east of England towards less prosperous parts of the UK, Mr McDonnell will tell the conference. He is also expected to push for a Financial Transaction Tax on stock market trading, arguing that a so-called “Robin Hood” tax could rein in the excesses of the financial sector. He told a fringe meeting at the Labour conference that he had reached an agreement with Shadow Business Secretary Angela Eagle to launch an "open" debate in Labour with a view to making a FTT party policy. George Osborne has fought moves to introduce such a tax, warning it would harm the City. Mr McDonnell is also expected to announce a review of HMRC to find out how it could bolster its efforts to collect the billions of pounds avoided by UK companies and individuals every year.

Corbyn calls for graded Inheritance tax
Jeremy Corbyn says IHT should be graded, as the current single rate means the "very richest become richer". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that a planned rise in the threshold amounted to a "tax break" for the wealthiest 60,000 families. Mr Corbyn added that he would like to deliver a tax cut for those paying the lowest rate of income tax. He would increase the top rate of income tax from 45p to 50p, he added, rather than the 60p rate that shadow chancellor John McDonnell has previously advocated. Mr Corbyn also said that the government is doing "very little" about companies that have moved their offices overseas for tax reasons. Citing the example of Boots, he said that if a company is making a lot of money in Britain it "should pay tax on what they earn in Britain, not by some piece of sophistry move it to Switzerland, Luxembourg or Lichtenstein".

Escaping stamp duty on enveloped properties
House buyers have been told they could save millions in stamp duty on high-end “enveloped” properties if they purchase the offshore company that owns the house. It comes after Aston Chase, agents for an £8.95m house off Regent’s Park in London, said purchasers can save £985,750 in stamp duty by buying a Guernsey-based corporate entity whose sole asset is the property. They will, however, be liable for the annual tax on enveloped dwellings (Ated), which the agency says will amount to £54,450 a year. Agent Henry Pryor said of the offer: “This happens but it is very, very rare for it to be talked about publicly. As a buying agent I would take a cautious view of it — I would expect HMRC to take a long hard look at this.”

SMEs

SME owners take more in dividends
SME owners are increasingly shunning reinvestment to withdraw more money from their companies. The percentage of profits paid out as dividends last year rose to 63%, up from 46% 12 months before, according to an analysis of Companies House data. The increase has been blamed on fears about changes to the tax regime ahead of May’s election, and has given rise to fears that an overhaul of the dividend tax regime could undermine growth. Moore Stephens has predicted a rush to withdraw dividends under the existing rules before the new regime comes into force in 2016. Tax partner Mike Cooper explained: “SME owners took out a much higher percentage of profits last year partly due to fears about what a future government’s tax policies might be… the dividend tax changes announced in the summer budget meant that the decision to take money out early was arguably the right one.” More than 25,000 small business leaders have so far signed up to a campaign against changes to the tax charges on dividends announced in July's Budget.

EIB turns to P2P
The European Investment Bank is preparing to lend £100m to UK SMEs via the peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle. Funding Circle said the vehicle for the investment would probably be a London-listed fund that it is preparing to launch, becoming the first marketplace lender to run its own fund. The EIB said there was “huge demand for initiatives to improve access to finance by small businesses across Europe” but that its lending through UK high street banks had been limited since the launch of the Funding for Lending Scheme in 2012.

Late payments leave SMEs with little choice
Finance company LDF says Britain's late payments culture is to blame for an increase in the amount of VAT that has not been paid on time to HMRC. It said SMEs are left with little choice but to pay their VAT bills late because their cashflow is not sufficient to cope with the late payment of bills by customers. Official figures show that VAT arrears now stand at £2.58bn, up from £2.55bn in 2014. Meanwhile, the Independent’s David Prosser notes many small businesses are likely to be deterred from taking legal action to obtain money owed from late-paying customers, after the MoJ announced an increase in fees for people taking cases to court. He describes the proposals as unjust and economically misguided.

INDUSTRY

Finance salaries soar
Finance professionals, IT staff and marketing executives have seen their salaries increase by 5.7% this year, as the economic recovery translates into more jobs and more competition to hire the best workers. According to the Association of Professional Staffing Companies (Apsco), recruiters have 8% more vacancies on their books now than they did at the same point in 2014. Finance and accounting jobs lead the way, with 16% more jobs available now than a year ago. Financial services staff are now being offered packages paying an average of 8.5% more than they were a year ago, while workers with sales skills are typically paid 16.9% more.

Deloitte shakes up hiring policy
Deloitte has revealed plans to hire staff from a more diverse range of backgrounds, by favouring candidates from disadvantaged households or regions, and historically poorly-performing schools. The firm will also stop job interviewers seeing where applicants have studied, to avoid any inadvertent favouritism or bias in hiring decisions.

PENSIONS

High fees hurt pension savings
Better Finance, the Brussels-based investor rights group, has warned that excessive charges on pension savings products are destroying the hope of a comfortable retirement for millions. MD Guillaume Prache said pension products in many European countries have delivered disappointing or even negative long-term returns since 2000, and that the main reason is the “excessive level of fees and commissions charged.” Separately, a survey by Zurich has indicated that 26% of over-55’s could delay their retirement after dipping into their savings under new pension freedoms.

ECONOMY

CEBR predicts delayed rate rise
The CEBR has predicted that the Bank of England is likely to keep interest rates on hold until the middle of next year. It believes a rise in May or August 2016 is more likely than one in February, its previous prediction, following signs of a global economic slowdown in China and emerging markets. The Centre expects the economy to grow by 2.5% this year, but for it to slow to 2% in 2016 and then average just 1.7% over the years 2017 to 2020.

Record investment to fuel economy
The EY Item Club has predicted that the economy will avoid stagnation because of record investment by companies over the next few years. In its report on business investment, the Club says Britain has seen relatively strong investment since the economy emerged from recession in 2009. It forecasts that business investment will rise by an average of 6.4% annually until 2019, when it will reach a record high of 12.9% of GDP.
