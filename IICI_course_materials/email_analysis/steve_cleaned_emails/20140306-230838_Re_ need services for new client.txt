Hi Steve.

Sorry for the delay with the reply - i am out office this week.

We know that one can incorporate a company in Gambia totally anonymously, so we need to get a copy of the passport to whom (same name!) we need to forward the incoming mail (it has to be transparent).
Otherwise we cannot accept this order (for our own security) at all.

Best regards,
Elena
