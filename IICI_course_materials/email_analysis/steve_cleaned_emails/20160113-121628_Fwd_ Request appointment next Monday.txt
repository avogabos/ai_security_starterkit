Thank you very much for your email.
I have taken a look through the email and may I check if you have the Certificate of Incumbency as well?
For the verification in London, I will definitely be able to assist to arrange for the appointment.  However, with regards to the signing of the documents,
 your daughter will have to sign as well since she is the sole director. She will be required to pass a Standard Bank’s Resolution to appoint yourself as the authorised person and signatory of the account. As such, we will need both yourself and your daughter
 to sign the documents.
Our office will be closed on 1 Oct 2015 due to a company event and there will be no access to our email. Business
 resumes on Monday 5 Oct 2015, and I will revert to you when I am back.
