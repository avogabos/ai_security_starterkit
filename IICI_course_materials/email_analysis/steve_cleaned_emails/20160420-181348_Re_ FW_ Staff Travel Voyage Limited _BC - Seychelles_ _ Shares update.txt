Hi Steve, sorry delay
There has been another slight
change before we proceed, do you mind issuing new transfer forms as the system
now shows.
And as below
Also i noted this person on
there?! (Jonathan Arafena??) Nothing to do with us! Can you check and delte him
out as well as the example shareholder....Under applications and alootments the
system shows different to under share certs
Appreciate if you could provide
the relevant official transfer forms and we can put this one to bed now.
Many thanks
Phil
