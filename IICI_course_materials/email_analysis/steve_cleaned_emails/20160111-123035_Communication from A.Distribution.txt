Dear Steve,

I hope you have started the new year in the best way.
Following your instructions, I tried to change the position of Maria Stella
Pistone from secretary to director and secretary in society. Whereas I have
not found the section "Requirement for Change", I made several attempts to
find a section that would accept my request about Maria Stella Pistone and
I submit it.Having not seen any change on the company document, I repeated
the operation again.
I definitely made a mistake. Can you help me, please? Can you control my
procedure, Please?

Thank you in advance

Best regards

Simonetta Stabile
