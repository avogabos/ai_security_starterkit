Hi Delphine,
 
Thank you for your reply. Both of those addresses are correct, the company one and my personal one. The problem is that my personal address is showing on the Companies House records as a registered address for the company from the 25/11/14 to the 15/12/14. This should not have been used an official registered address for the company and I don't know why this was the case. Can you please remove this address as having been a registered address for the company?
 
Many thanks,
 
James

Further to my email below, I have just

a registered address for the company. Can you please refer to my email below and

Hi Delphine,
 
I hope you had a 
nice Easter.
 
Thank you for back dating the appointment of 
director also the registered address at Puddle Dock is correct thank 
you. 
 
I just wanted to clarify please regarding my personal address 
showing. This is actually showing as an official registered address for the 
company, however it should never have been used as a registered address for the 
company, there must have been some kind of miscommunication at the time of the 
registration. Is it possible at all to remove this address from the records as a 
registered address for the company. I don't mind it showing on the record as my 
personal address that is fine, just not as an official address of the company. 
Can you please look to correct the record to remove my personal address as 
having been an official registered address of the company?
 
Many 
thanks,
 
James

Hi 
James,
 
The 
appointment of the director has been back 
dated.
 
You have not purchased our Registered Address Service this is why the 
following address shows as the company's registered address as per your 
instruction at the time of purchase of the company:
2 PUDDLE DOCK, 
BLACKFRIARS 
LONDON 
EC4V 3BB 

 
Regarding your personal address, you have not purchased the Director's Privacy Protection Service that is why your personal address is appearing on the record.
 
Regards,
 
Delphine

Hi Delphine,
 
I hope you're having a good day. I've 
just checked the Companies House register and it is now showing 
myself as company director, however this is showing appointed 
as todays date. Can you please have this backdated to when it 
should have appeared on the 25/11/14? 
 
Also it is 
still showing my personal address on the records, as well as WWW.BUY-THIS-COMPANY-NAME.COM under the previous office

the above name. Can you please check this and come back to me

Hi Delphine and 
Steve,
 
At the beginning of the year you helped me to finalise the 
purchase and set up of the above established company. I have just 
had someone come back to me stating that according to Companies 
House there are no appointed directors at the moment for the 
company!? 
 
The other point is that the records also show 
my personal home address as having been a registered office, which was 
stated initially as this would not occur. Further to this 
the previous address shows as being from www.buy-this-company-name.com. This should only show the 29 
Harley Street aspect not the company description. Can you please get them to 
amend the records immediately to remove my home address as well as this 
description!?
