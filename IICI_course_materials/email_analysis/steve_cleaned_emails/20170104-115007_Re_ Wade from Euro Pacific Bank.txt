Hi Angela
I am sorry to hear that, I have reviewed the documentation and found the following:
1. Could you please provide a clearer scan of the Passport - no need for certification.
2. The proof of address document is due to pass the 90 day requirement in a few days, it maybe worth while asking for another certified copy if we don't receive the remaining documentation.
The following are still outstanding:
1.  The bank contract and corporate resolution are still outstanding, see links below.
EPB Corporate Contract -

docs/EPB_contract_corporate.pd
f
EPB resolution authorizing opening of bank account -

/docs/EPB_corporate_resolution
_template.doc
2.  Compliance will require some supporting documents if possible for the incoming/outgoing wires as per the preapproval form eg. MARQUEZ SARRAFF, IMPUCHE, TRANSFORMADORES ITESA.
Lastly I have attached a document called SDR which shows WORLDWIDE VENTURES listed as holding shares in the company, please advise.

RE: Wade from Euro Pacific Bank
Ok… but I also send you a bank letter…..it doesn’t work to you?
I also just speak with the person in charge of our process at Formations House and told me that at the end of the day will be sending me an update because as he
 knows they send all the documents to de euro pacific bank.
We keep in contact.
