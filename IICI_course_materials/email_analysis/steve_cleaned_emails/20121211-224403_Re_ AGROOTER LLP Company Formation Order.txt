Dear Steve!

You are very kind, thanks for the question. 

Yes, I dont know about one answer, but I will call You tomorrow about that from my office, so I hope, I can finish tomorrow the company registration.

Your system is brilliant perfect, my english is terrible, this is a reason.

Have a nice evening

Kindest regards
