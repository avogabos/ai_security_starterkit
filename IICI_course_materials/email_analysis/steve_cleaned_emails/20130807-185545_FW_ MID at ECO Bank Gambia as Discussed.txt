Subject: MID at ECO Bank Gambia as Discussed

Hi Oliver,

Further to our telephone conversation I think we were agreed that we would
be willing to pay the £495 for a company formation in Gambia and then a
merchant ID through ECO Bank Gambia so long as we could get answers to the
following questions in relation to that merchant ID.
You said you could get answers to this within the next 24 hours which we
would find really useful. :

1) Please get approval from EcoBank in Gambia first prior to our paying the
£495 formation fee. Showing them the website and our product offering.
2) MID what are the rates for the merchant account,. % per transaction,
chargeback fees etc
3) Is there a rolling reserve on the account
4) Currency acquisition what currency would the merchant account be provided
in?
5) Is there a limitation on the amount of capital we can transfer out of the
Gambian banking system.
6) Is there a payment delay on transactions.
7) What documents do we need to form the company in Gambia?
8) What are the tax implications of trading in Gambia?
9) Can we use a payment provider to process the cards similar to Secure
Trading?
10) Have you confirmed with the bank the product that we sell is acceptable.

thanks for any answers you can supply to the above questions. If you can
acknowledge receipt and let me know a timeline for response would be great!


Regards

James
