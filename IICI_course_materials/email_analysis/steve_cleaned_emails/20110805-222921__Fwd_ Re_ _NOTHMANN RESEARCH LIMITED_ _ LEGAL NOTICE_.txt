Hi, Steve:
This is a very serious situation than cannot be sustained in a reputable
company as FormationsHouse.

I would appreciate your necessary arrangements to solve this, and the
proper measures to avoid further mistakes like this one.

Regards,


Manuel.

    Hi:
I have received this e-mail, when I actually paid my fee. I'm attaching
the invoice. For sure, it has been a mistake on your side, and I would
appreciate if you could reinstate this ASAP.

Kind Regards,

Manuel.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
Dear Manuel Del Moral,
The records at Companies House indicate that you are using our address as the registered address for the company(s)
NOTHMANN RESEARCH LIMITED,
that you are responsible for. Your service with us has expired.
This means in effect that this company is trading without a valid legal registered address in the UK. This is an offence under the Companies Act, which may lead to your disbarment as a director and fines under the Companies Act.
We urge you to either move your registered address or renew subscription to our Registered Address Service. Failing either action, we will have no recourse but to inform Companies House that you do not have a Registered Address at our location, which may lead to prosecution under the Companies Act.
We have sent you many reminders informing you of the same, failure to act on your behalf will regrettably lead to the next step, at which point the legal process will start, which will have very serious implications for YOU.
To renew your service, please login into My Account (http://www.formationshouse.com)
Your Login ID is as under:
Customer ID: 82586254
