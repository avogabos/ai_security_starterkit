Hi Steve,

We've got this letter today and tried to log in to our account to file 
information requested just to find that our online company admin has 
expired and we don't see a way to renew it. Could you please give me 
some guidance in this matter?
We use log in form here: https://www.formationshouse.com/myaccount.php 
and log in with the ID 4134665

Besides online company admin renewal we have another issue - the message 
system in our account tells us that we have overdue Annual accounting 
(we're not really) and our registered address has expired (should expire 
at 10th Sept 2016 according to your letter from 01 Feb 2016). Could you 
please let me know how to fix these mistakes?

Thank you for help,
Alex
