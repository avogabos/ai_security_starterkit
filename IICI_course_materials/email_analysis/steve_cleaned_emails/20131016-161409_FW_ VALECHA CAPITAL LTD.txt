Subject: FW: VALECHA CAPITAL LTD
From: "Charlotte Pawar" <cp@accountscentre.net>
To: "Steve" <steve@formationshouse.com>

We shall be refunding the fee for the LLP of £500.

 

As explained previously by Mrs Pawar, it is not possible to register a Sole
Proprietor in the UK with Companies House. You have previously mentioned you
would register a sole proprietorship outside of the EU where it is then
possible to use a non EU Sole Proprietor as a Corporate Director.

 

We suggest as we have not charged anything additional, that you discuss the
Sole Proprietor requirements with your new agent.

 

Your cheque will be posted today and you should have it this week.

Dear Charlotte,

 

I intend to use the existing registration of VALECHA CAPITAL LTD. Please do
not cancel the registration or refund the charge of registering the limited
liability company. 

 

I am still awaiting details of the sole proprietorship you have registered.
Please inform me if you would like to deduct a charge for this registration.


 

Upon receiving these details please mail a cheque with the amount you wish
to refund to my company address.

Thanking You.

 

Regards,

 

Ajay
