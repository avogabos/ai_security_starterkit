Hi stve

Not your fault as you weren’t to know

 

Block his number, and any emails just ignore and forward to me

 

If he calls some other way, tell him you need my permission to process. 

 

The annual return I need to look at and decide what to do

 

Thanks

Hi,

Ayub used to email addresses akhan1@europe.com <mailto:akhan1@europe.com>  and ebm@europe.com <mailto:ebm@europe.com>  and following are the last emails that i received from his 2 emails account to my 2 email accounts steve@formationshouse.com <mailto:steve@formationshouse.com>  and talal@formationshouse.com <mailto:talal@formationshouse.com> 

Last Order dated 01-Aug-2016 orderno. 190568 GBP 15, annual return filing for QUANTUM BUSINESS PARTNERS was done on phone.

I took the order because was not aware of the situation at that time, wont happen again.

Please advice what to do next time, should i ask for payment for services or tell him to take his companies to some other agent?

Sincerely,

Talal...

please activate telephone and fax if not already assigned.


It is possible that Fahad has already created a letterhead for this company previously (I cant remember). If so we can use that one.

Many Thanks
