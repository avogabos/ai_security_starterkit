Dear Alex

 

It is good to hear from you

 

There are 2 type of readymade companies 

 

1 - Old UK readymade companies with real trading history and active trading accounts have been filed with these companies

At companies House.

Purchasing these type of companies comes with a risk, as maybe this company has done a fraud and had bad reputation

In the market, that is why they are selling it off

 

2 - Old UK readymade companies, we have done some in house little transactions just to file active trading accounts for them

At Companies House.

Buying these kind of companies give you an assurance that these companies haven’t done any fraud and have not involved in any

Bad reputation in the market 

 

You have to describe this to your customer

 

I have some of these companies here 

 

@BIZ LTD – 2002 capital shows as £1000 but has continuous filed accounts - 10 K GBP 

 

RESOURCE CENTRAL LIMITED – 2010 – capital shows as £1000 but has continuous filed accounts - 8 K GBP 

 

MAZARINE CONSULTANCY LIMITED – 2009 - capital shows as £1000 but has continuous filed accounts - 9 K GBP

 

UNITED CONSULTANCY LTD - 2003 – Annual Returns waiting to file, currently showing balance sheet of £2m in share assets - 20 K GBP

 

INTERNATIONAL TRADE LTD – 2004- Annual Returns waiting to file, currently showing balance sheet of £2m in share assets - 18 K GBP

 

COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL LTD – 2004 - currently showing balance sheet of £2m in share assets - 18 K GBP
