Thank you Steve.
The reason is to avoid any connection between different operations world wide and not to link between them. It is important also due to partners in other operations which top secrecy is important to avoid inconvenience with them.
This is why I asked you for nominee services.
I guess tax issues are important also but not the main issue.
I would like to clarify that our emails are subject to confidentiality. 
Best,

Thank you Steve.
The reason is to avoid any connection between different operations world wide and not to link between them. It is important also due to partners in other operations which top secrecy is important to avoid inconvenience with them.
This is why I asked you for nominee services.
I guess tax issues are important also but not the main issue.
I would like to clarify that our emails are subject to confidentiality.

Dear Ronny
I will check with my manager and we will speak to the bank, if
we can process bank account with the bank reference letter. But first I want to
clarify, if client is willing to provide his/her passport and proof of address,
then why bank reference letter will have any effect on their privacy?
You can call me between 12pm to 7pm UK time, Monday to Friday.

Dear Steve,
Thank you for your replay.
The only "deal breaker" is the bank reference
letter. The operation is quite big, dealing technology platform and crm system
and the client is serious but he will refuse to supply bank reference to
protect privacy.
Let us speak tomorrow or at Thursday by phone to find solution
in order to move forward.
Please write me when you can find convenient time to speak.
We shall discuss prices upon closing.
