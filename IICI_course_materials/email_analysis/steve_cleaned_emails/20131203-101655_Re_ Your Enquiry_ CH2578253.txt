Dear Sir

Re: SERVICES DES LECTEUR LIMITED    No. 7092692

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file
the following documents, fees and late filing penalties:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual returns for 1 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, with a filing
fee of £40.00 per form.

3) Accounts for the period ending 31 December 2010, 2011 and 2012.

4) A late filing penalty of £1500.00 for the accounts ending 31
December 2010. There are no penalties for the later accounts as they
became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

5) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered
online at

Yours faithfully
