Dear Steve

Pleased to advise the Staff Travel Voyage Limited annual company renewal
fee has now been paid per attached and below including the request for cert
of incomb. Money should clear with you within 2 hours.

I would like to get access again to the account's on line administrator
asap to make a change to shareholders, if you could let me know as soon as
I can do this now that the bill has been paid.

Also please advise when we can expect the cert of Incomb

Many thanks and regards
