Panama Papers claim first major casualty

Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, Iceland's prime minister, has resigned after revelations in the leaked Panama Papers showed he owned an offshore company with his wife but had not declared it when he entered parliament. He is one of dozens of high-profile global figures, including David Cameron’s father, Ian, mentioned in the 11.5m leaked financial and legal records. Ian Cameron’s offshore business, Blairmore Holdings, was moved to Ireland in 2010 because its directors believed it was about to “come under more scrutiny” after David Cameron became Prime Minister, according to the Telegraph. Mr Cameron has issued several statements in an attempt to cool speculation over his family’s finances, declaring that he, his wife and their children do not benefit from any offshore funds. However, critics said he was using semantics to avoid transparency with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calling for the PM to publish his tax returns to "set the record straight". Mr Corbyn added that HMRC should conduct an inquiry into how much private wealth was being "siphoned off" overseas. Separately, several papers muse on the fact that Mr Cameron was forced to answer questions on his family’s tax affairs while at PwC offices in Birmingham - the firm that had been accused of promoting tax avoidance on “an industrial scale” by MPs. Writing in the Guardian, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says the Panama revelations are a “Tory crisis, firmly rooted in their beliefs and attitudes”. He calls on the Government to “stop dithering” and act now to stop tax dodging.

Cameron urged to take hardline with tax havens

The revelations in the Panama Papers have added pressure on David Cameron to persuade UK tax havens to agree to create central registries of beneficial ownership before a London anti-corruption summit in May. The PM’s proposal to create a central register of beneficial ownership open to public scrutiny was rejected by territories including Bermuda, the Caymans and the British Virgin Islands. Mr Cameron since suggested registries could be accessed only by British and other tax authorities and police on request, but Labour has now called on the government to consider imposing "direct rule" on British Overseas Territories if they do not comply with UK tax law. However, former attorney-general Dominic Grieve said overseas territories were “entitled to internal self-governance” and to run banking services to sustain their economies. Britain is setting up its own public register in June but critics have said a new public register of company owners will add to costs and bureaucracy for businesses while remaining toothless and unpoliced.

Kezia Dugdale claims Labour tax plans better for families

Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has insisted middle and low income earners will be better off under her tax plans, claiming analysis by her party suggests a couple living in Aberdeen, earning a combined £40,000 a year, would be £278 a year better-off through the scrapping of council tax and changes to income tax. Campaigning in Glasgow with City Council leader Frank McAveety, Ms Dugdale has also suggested the average council tax payer in the city will be £135 better off under Labour’s property tax. Glasgow has fewer highest band properties than many other councils, notes the Evening Times, with just 660 in Band H.

FCA promises money laundering crackdown

The Financial Conduct Authority has confirmed it has written to a “number of firms” about disclosures in the Panama Papers, including those on the regulator’s Systematic Anti-Money Laundering Programme. A spokesman for the FCA said: “We are working closely with a number of other agencies who are also looking at this. As part of our responsibility to ensure the integrity of the UK financial markets we require all authorised firms to have systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk that they might be used to commit financial crime.”

New U.S. rules on tax inversions

The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed tough new restrictions on corporate inversions which will make it harder for companies to move their tax addresses out of the U.S. and then transfer profits to low-tax countries by use of a tactic known as earnings stripping. The ruling surprised Wall Street and has put into doubt the $150bn merger between Pfizer and Allergan, which was on track to be the biggest deal of its kind. The new rules take particular aim at overseas companies that have completed multiple deals with U.S. firms in a short period of time, what the regulator calls “serial inverters.”

Tax havens a barrier to equality

The Independent’s Ben Chu says the Panama Papers show how a focus on tax havens will help combat inequality. He suggests although questions over income tax rates or tax credits are important as policy issues, what we are doing about assets and incomes that are hidden off-shore is more important when it comes to addressing the gap between the super wealthy and the rest of us. He cites LSE researcher Gabriel Zucman who estimates that $7.6trn is held in tax havens – around 10% of global GDP.

IHT loopholes

The Telegraph lists essential loopholes for those seeking to reduce IHT payments, amid estimates that death tax takings will have risen 20% to a record high of £4.6bn for the 2015/16 tax year. Other papers offer similar advice and point out that an increase in probate fees could push up the costs for estates worth over £2m from £215 today to £20,000.

Reliefs for self-employed end

The Mirror notes that workers employed by umbrella companies, usually classed as self-employed, can no longer claim tax relief on travel, food and accommodation from today. It is estimated the tax will mean thousands of construction and agency workers will lose an average £1,000 a year.

Treasury expects £2.6bn boost from dividend payments surge

Treasury receipts will be boosted by an estimated £2.6bn from a surge in last-minute dividend payments ahead of Wednesday’s tax changes which will increase bills for about 700,000 shareholders. Business owners with incomes of more than £150,000 will have their dividends taxed at 38.1%, an increase of nearly 7%, in a move designed to discourage people from setting up companies simply to reduce their tax bills. However, SME groups have said the rules will mean many hard-working company owners will lose thousands of pounds in income. Clive Lewis, the head of enterprise at the ICAEW, said that people will now need to be making at least £30,000 a year to make company formation tax efficient.

SMEs exposed to late payments

Research from the Interface Financial Group reveals that 84% of small businesses have experienced late payments and 40% are owed more than £10,000.

Bankruptcy made easier and cheaper

Changes being introduced today will make it simpler and cheaper to go bankrupt in England and Wales. Applications to enter bankruptcy will be made online rather than by petitioning the court and assessed by a government adjudicator rather than a judge, bringing the cost down from £705 to £655. Phillip Sykes, president of R3, commented: "The easier it is for an individual to enter an insolvency procedure that is appropriate to their situation, the easier it is for them to pay back what they can and to get back on their own two feet again. It's better for the individual, their creditors and the rest of society."

PENSIONS

 

FCA to review pensions advice

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will be reviewing advice available to pensioners this year and is planning a new "advice unit" that will help firms set up robo-advice units. The move comes as financial services firms see a 42% reduction in the "pensions guidance levy" which is used to fund the Pension Wise advice service.

Germans to introduce new register

In the wake of the Panama Papers leak, German justice minister, Heiko Mass, said the country planned to introduce a new national transparency register to make offshore companies disclose their owners’ identity. Meanwhile, France’s finance minister said Panama would again be blacklisted as an uncooperative tax haven and that a preliminary investigation into "aggravated tax fraud" would be launched. In the US, President Barack Obama said the problem with global tax avoidance was that it was legal. “We shouldn’t make it legal to engage in transactions just to avoid taxes,” he said, praising instead “the basic principle of making sure everyone pays their fair share”.

ECONOMY

 

UK service sector growth remains subdued

The latest Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.7 last month, up from February's near three-year low of 52.7, indicating growth in the UK's services sector picked up but remained subdued, BBC News suggests. "Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

ONS moves towards including sharing economy data in official figures

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revealed details of its first assessment of how counting the ever-growing so-called "sharing economy" information might work in practice. Counting the sharing economy within national productivity and economic figures has the support of many businesses, suggests City AM, and has also been backed by business secretary Sajid Javid. "It's great to see ONS recognising how our economy is changing," said Debbie Wosskow, chair of industry group Sharing Economy UK and founder of Love Home Swap.
