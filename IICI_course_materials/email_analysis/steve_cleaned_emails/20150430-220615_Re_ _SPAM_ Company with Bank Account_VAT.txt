Hello,
Thank you for your informative feedback. Regarding this particular passage in your email: 

Scan color copies of following documents are required for company beneficial owner/director/s and shareholder/s.

1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport

2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.
...What I'm wanting to do is establish an entity in another country, a country other than the U.S., with its banking in another country with bank secrecy as well. 

The underlying purpose is strict business and personal privacy and security. The entity is simply needed in order to hold or own a brand name/trademark, combined with private banking to be able to process purchase orders and process funds in general to fulfill said orders, pay suppliers (one in U.S.), the product producer (located in China), etc. None of this is possible in the U.S. - there's no privacy or property rights really, anymore. The owner of the entity is actually based in the U.S., looking for this solution. It appears that the passage highlighted above would defeat this entire objective - this could all just be done in the U.S., with the same results.
Would a trust setup work, to hold the brand name and be the legal business entity that can have banking, in a country with banking secrecy, and conduct business transactions, as described? If so, if understood correctly, the U.S. person would need to have a person that could act as the Trustee - does this come with the service for a trust you offer, or could the U.S. person act privately in all three roles of a trust? And finally, would any other type of entity be required if a trust is setup, for business to be conducted and the banking required, to be held by the trust?
Thanks,Mike
