Do you need a Company Secretary for an Irish registered company?
Dear Steve,
Do 
                              you need somebody to take the headache out of your 
                              company secretarial assignments?
Well for more than 25 years, here in CFI, we have 
                              been helping clients, just like you with every possible 
                              type of company secretarial procedure.
This has ranged from the incorporation of new companies 
                              all the way through to voluntary strike off or liquidation. 
                              We have also brought dissolved companies 'back to 
                              life' by having them restored to the index either 
                              on a 'same day' basis or through the High Court.
Please
CLICK 
                              HERE
to see a full list of our services 
                              and our fees (by the way we
always work 
                              on a fixed fee basis
. What we quote 
                              is what we charge - no hidden extras, or cost overruns).
We also operate what we call our
'Company Secretarial 
                              Maintenance'
program which will be of interest 
                              if you look after the annual CRO filings for one 
                              or indeed many companies.
This is where the co sec requirements of single 
                              or multiple companies are outsourced/sub-contracted/transferred 
                              to CFI thereby reducing costs and freeing up staff 
                              to work on more valuable fee earning projects. The 
                              beauty of this program is that you never need to 
                              worry about CRO late filing fees again as CFI guarantee 
                              to pay them where we are at fault. My colleague 
                              Sue Jesper has all the details on this scheme.
If you have any questions on any of the topics 
                              raised here then please give me a call or send me 
                              an email, I would genuinely love to hear from you.
Yours 
                              sincerely,
