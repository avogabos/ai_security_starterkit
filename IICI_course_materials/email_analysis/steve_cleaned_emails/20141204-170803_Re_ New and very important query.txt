Hi
Sorry to hear about the situation, I pray that everything gets
right for you and your family.
Yes If companies were registered in UK then we were able to
assist you. You need to register the companies in UK and then we will be able to
provide you the services.

Re: New and very important query
Hi,
good to hear that you are fine !
i am very uncomfortable, i have tension every day because of
this all situation in my country, sometime i just sit and cry for
hours........but Thanks Allah me and my family is alive !!!! sometime i want to
leave Ukraine and go far away,, but then what our parents will do over here ?
crisis crisis and very big crisis !!!! i have pain very deeply in my Heart !!!
anyways,,,,
so as i understood if this both company was registered in UK
then we could transferred them ? but as this 2 companies registered in Cyprus
and Singapore you cant provide service for them ?
actually i thought you can do that, Cyprus and 2nd one,
 could be  registered in your system so in Companies House and become
UK companies  so this way you will provide all renewals for us ? please
confirm......
cheers,
Maria
