Actually it came back to me a few days ago as I messed it up! On one of the
resolutions I had put ACTIONS not ACTION so I have resubmitted.  It will be
changed by Monday.  So sorry about this - please tell the customer that
there has been a delay at Companies House as there is a back log.or
something along those line please?

 

Many thanks
