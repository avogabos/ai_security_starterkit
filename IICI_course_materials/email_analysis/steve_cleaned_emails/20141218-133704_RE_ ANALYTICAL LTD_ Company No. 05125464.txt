Hi
Steve,

 

I've just realised that the name change hasn't been updated for the
company or the accounts. As per below the below emails we requested
with Delphine that this be changed to ATS Worldwide. Can we please complete
this name change asap? I can transfer funds immediately for the same day
company name change.

 

Many thanks,

 

James

Hi Steve,

 

I have been dealing with Delphine with respect to setting up a premade company.
There are a couple of points that I would like to confirm with respect to the
company please, as follows:

 

- The registered
address has been updated but not the change of company name, we requested
this to be changed to ATS Worldwide. Can you please advise if there is
anything further I need to do for this to be actioned?

 

- The SIC code also hasn't been updated, can you please update this
to 62012?

 

- Finally she has provided us with the amended accounts for the
company, these are all correct except for the registered address for the
company is showing as my personal address, not the actual address which
is:

 

2 PUDDLE DOCK 

BLACKFRIARS 

LONDON 

ENGLAND 

EC4V 3BB

 

Also with the accounts, can you please confirm what the cost is for these? I
had been quoted £500 for this when I was referred to Formations
House for the company set up.

 

Many thanks for your help.

 

James Neville
