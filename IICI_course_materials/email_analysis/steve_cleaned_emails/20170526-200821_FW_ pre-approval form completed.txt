good morning
attached you will find the form completed

please check to see if you find any errors, so i can correct them

i will go to our mayor's office tomorrow to get my ID certified

bank statements can not be certified

the utility bills i have are in PDF format and hence can not be certified !
they can be checked electronically since they have a bar code and a we-blink for verification

in France, we no longer have paper utility bills, due to cop25 all invoices are in PDF format to be downloaded from service provider website

i have the  following utility bills available:
- mobile phone
- home phone
- electricity

water is the name of my wife
please help me out with this issue
warmest regards
Karim Mousli
