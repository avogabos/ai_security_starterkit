Dear Mr Gomes 

Thank you for your recent enquiry. 

The Companies Act 2006 introduced changes to the arrangements for inspecting
a company's registers. Depending on the nature and situation of the company
it may be obliged to keep up to 13 possible registers. These registers must
either be held at the Registered Office Address (ROA), or at a Single
Alternative Inspection Location (SAIL). 

The SAIL address must be an alternate/different address to the registered
office, but still within the country of registration (England/Wales;
Scotland; Northern Ireland). 

Form AD02 is used to notify the SAIL address; form AD03 is used to notify
which documents are kept at the SAIL;  any of these documents returned to
the registered office is notified via form AD04; if the company is
registered for on-line filing, all of these forms can be delivered
electronically. 

These notices can be delivered electronically via on-line filing service, or
as paper forms by post. 

Unfortunately, updates cannot be made via e-mail. 

Yours sincerely 

K M Jones
