Thank you information Steve.

 

Is there by change a way for Formation House to facilitate the payment to Companies House if we were to send the funds to Formations House via wire transfer? 

 

It would be a bit difficult for us to mail a cheque out for us.  

 

Please let me know if there are other options available.

 

Thanks.

Janay
