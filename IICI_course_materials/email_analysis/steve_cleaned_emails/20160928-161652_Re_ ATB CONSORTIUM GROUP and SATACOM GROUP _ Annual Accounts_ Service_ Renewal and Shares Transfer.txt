Dear Ekaterina
For people in client services this is routine
J
.
Good to hear that your client is calm now.
Just to let you know, if UK company do not do any business in
previous year than company files DORMANT COMPANY ACCOUNTS which defines company
previous year status as non-trading by showing ‘0’ transactions.
However if there is even 1 single transaction in the whole year
than company must file ANNUAL ACCOUNTS. And since client has sent company’s
bank statement which shows number of transactions, therefore company is liable
to submit Annual Accounts and Tax Returns.
Regards
Steve..

Re: ATB CONSORTIUM GROUP and SATACOM GROUP : Annual Accounts,
Service Renewal and Shares Transfer
Dear Steve,
thanks for your email. I copy your words and sent to client)
Now he is calmer.
Just before he always prepared annual
accounts with help of another company and it was dormant
accounts.
Now he wanted prepare not dormant annul account and he payed us for this. So he
is really very nervous.
Still we talk every day, i promise that everything will be allright and annual
accounts is not smth extraodinary, so nothing to be worried about)))
But thats his character. He always was like this....Always suspect smth
negative....((
Also his bank wants to see anuual accounts of ATB  as soon as possible
cause the Bank doen not accept UK companies with dormant accounts
anymore.
Anyway thanks a lot for your
email. It really helped to make client calmer)
Bst regards,
Ekaterina.

Dear
Ekaterina
Thank
you for your patience.
I
have spoken with our Accounting Support team and preparation of Annual Accounts
for company ATB CONSORTIUM GROUP is in process and will be available to you for
review in 2 working days.
Please
note that in Extreme Accounting Service GBP 500 the turnaround time is 15
working days, and you can also explain to your client to calm them down that
filing date for Annual Accounts is 31
st
October 2016 (it can be
verified on government website) so we have good amount of time and filing will
be done before the last date.
Regards
Steve…
