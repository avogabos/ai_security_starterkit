Dear Sir

Re ? London Matrix Ltd - 8706471

The above company was removed from the Register, for non compliance, of its filing requirements.

If the above company is required on the Register, you can apply for it to be Administratively Restored.  To proceed with this process, Companies House will require the following documents:-

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

3) Annual Return form for the year ending ?
25th September 2015, with the filing fee of £40.
(This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).

Please note the Accounts for the period ending 30th September 2015, will be due by 30th June 2016.

Having checked our records, no late filing penalty would have been generated, upon its restoration.

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.

Restoration Department.
