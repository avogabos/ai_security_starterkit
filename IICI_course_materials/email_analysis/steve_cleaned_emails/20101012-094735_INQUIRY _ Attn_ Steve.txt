Hi, Steve. It was a pleasure chatting with you.

I understand the Seychelles Company Formation "Special Offer" is still
available. I need to determine exactly what that includes.

1. Does it include a Registered Agent/Office?

2. Does it include a Certificate of Incumbency?

3. Notarised apostille doc's?

My needs for the most part are rather generic, BUT, one of the things I
intend to do with this corporation is open an account with a London UK
affiliate of a broker I've been using here in the states [Alpari UK], and
they DO have rather specific requirements, which I'll paste below:

~Signed application form and board resolution
~Memorandum and Articles of Association
~Certificate of Incorporation
If the required information is not confirmed in the Memorandum and Articles
of Association we require:
~Share Register / Share Certificate
~Certificate of Incumbency
~Signature List

I'm going to be initiating an IBC formation by end of week, so please get
back to me as soon as you can.

Also -- I have it narrowed down to formation in Seych and Belize. Am I
correct in my understanding that there is very little difference in
functionality between the two; Seych being a tad more expensive but a little
better with regard to privacy?

I'm available to call you if need be, just let me know.

Thanks Steve, have a good day, and God bless!
