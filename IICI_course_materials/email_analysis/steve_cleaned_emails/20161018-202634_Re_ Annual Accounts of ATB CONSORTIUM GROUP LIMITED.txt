Subject: Re: Annual Accounts of ATB CONSORTIUM GROUP LIMITED
From: Ekaterina Churilova <ekaterina4uk@gmail.com>
To: "support@accountscentre.com" <support@accountscentre.com>,  "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>, Андрей Никоноров <nicosgroup@mail.ru>

Dear Steve,

Could you please send me reference number
Of atb consortium group?
Client wants to pay corporate tax himself and he will do it just after
annual accounts will be e-filed.
I have hm revenue bank account details but
It says "use company reference number and accounts period" in payment
details. Otherwise there can be troubles with payment.

It would be great if you send me reference number please.

Thank you!
