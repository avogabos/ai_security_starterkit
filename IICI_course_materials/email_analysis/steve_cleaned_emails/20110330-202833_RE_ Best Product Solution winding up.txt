Hello Steve,

I saw on HMRC website that "From 1 April 2011 onwards, all companies and organisations will have to file their Company Tax Return 
online for any accounting period ending after 31 March 2010." This is the case for my company that will soon have to file its CT600.

I have just tried to register for Corporation Tax online on HMRC's website, but keep receiving the same error message:
----
Sorry we have encountered a problem

ERROR: We have been unable to enrol you for Corporation Tax (CT). Either the details you have
entered are incorrect, or you have already enrolled for this service. Please check your details and
try again.
If the problem persists contact the HM Revenue & Customs Online Services Helpdesk or select
next to continue.
----

I enter all the information correctly (the Corporation
Tax Reference: 7267326355 and Companies
House Registration Number (CRN): 5504066), 
therefore the only option left is that the company has already enrolled for this service. And since I haven't previously enrolled, 
my only assumption is that maybe you as the registered agent for the company have already enrolled for this service on our behalf.


Please advise me what to do in order to be able to file the CT600 for my company online as required by HMRC.

Thank you
Charles
