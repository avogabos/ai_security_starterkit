Dear
Mrs MT
            Hussain
It has come to
            our knowledge that
            your company MEDICAL POINT LTD (
Company
            number
07525995)
is using our
                address as Registered Address WITHOUT our consent and
                payment for service
                charges.
Please note that as per our
              agreement you can only use our
              address to receive general mails for company and those
              will be forwarded to you
              and it do not include our address to be use as Registered
              Address and to use mails
              from government.
Also as per our terms and
              conditions Virtual Office Mail only
              and Registered Address are 2 separate services.
Therefore please change your
              companys registered address
              and remove our address as soon as possible. OR if you wish
              to use our address
              as your companys registered address then please arrange
              payment of GBP
              150 along with following information and documents:
1.
            Company Name
2.
            Company Number
3.
            Companies House Web
            Filing Authentication Code
4. Proof
            of ID of company
            director/s (scan copy of valid passport)
5. Proof
            of Address of
            company director/s (scan copy of last 3 months utility bills
            (water or gas or
            electricity) OR personal bank/credit card statement)
6.
            Payment Details
Note that since you are using our
          Registered Address without
          our consent and service charges any mails from government
          received for company
          will not be forwarded to you, which can cause company to go
          into bad standing, impose
          financial penalties and eventually dissolved and we will not
          be responsible for
          it. Currently we have received 2 government mails from HMRC
          which we are unable
          to forward it to you.
Please change companys address as soon as
          possible or
          if you wish to use our address then please make arrangements
          as mentioned above.
If address is not changed or if we did not
          receive your
          response within 3 working days, then we will report it to
          Companies House
