Dear Sir/Madam

LONDON INVESTMENTS CONTROL LTD ? 06968450.

Thank you for your e mail concerning the restoration of the above company.

If you are going to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter. Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors website - https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/390209/BVC_14_Form_V15__1_.pdf

3)  Annual Return forms for the years ending 31/03/2014 and 31/03/2015 and filing fee of £80.

4)  Accounts for the period ending 31/07/2014.

The company will not incur any late filing penalties when making the application to restore as the accounts became overdue after the company was struck off the register.


Yours faithfully
