Steve,

I need a company in Delaware, because we are making adult video chat
web-page.

So, I can not sign the document with my name,
for this I need a nominee director, but I do not want to register
additional company somewhere.

Nominee director`s name will be on documents but I will manage signing, I
will do.

So is it possible?
