Dear Jonathan

 

 

In case if you have not received my previous email, I am resending this.

 

The document that you sent, is in bits and pieces, which is not acceptable.

 

Please send the document as 1 file. And also we require scan copy of your
passport.

 

Waiting for your reply.

 

 

Regards,

 

Steve Smith
