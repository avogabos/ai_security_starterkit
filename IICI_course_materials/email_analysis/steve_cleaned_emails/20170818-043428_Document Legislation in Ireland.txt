Steve... here are two+ very important dates for your company diary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear SteveKeeping you fully up to date about the Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements
of the Companies Act 2014

In this month's Ezine I'd like to draw your attention to not one but...
...two+ very important company legal administration dates in 2016.

Could I urge you to mark both of these dates in your diary now,  immediately, while
they are both fresh in your mind.

You see, both of these dates relate to an important decision that affects just about
ALL existing Irish registered private companies that are limited by shares.

* Your first date for your diary is the 31st August of this year
- which is closer than you might think.

* Your second date for your diary is three months later, on the 30th November of
 this year, and this is a deadline date which Companies Registration Office (CRO)
in Ireland has warned everyone not to overlook!

So important are these two dates in relation to your Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements of the Companies Act 2014,
that I'd added an extra calendar page below for your consideration.

My reason for including this extra call-to-action calendar page is because some 
days ago Companies Registration Office (CRO) in Ireland warned that as we get closer
to the  30th November 2016 deadline the expectation is that there will be a gigantic
upsurge in the number of applications being submitted for processing - so much so
that CRO may not be able to process all of them in time to beat the cut-off deadline
of the 30th November.

Whatever you do, don't let this happen to you or to any limited company that you
have a responsibility for... or an interest in.

With such important changes happening this year, I'd particularly like you to know
that you are very welcome to call either myself or my colleague, Sue Jesper, on 
01 664 1111 or email Sue on sue@formations.ie [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001rnbDATVXwzjtW7d1IDh5vlR__Z2RWJRv76BVRzOcnrPwJvYAagfaYSE9pWtJa1cW5kggAP8rddH2AEx8dTw_ZgCKYYVLIygUxCkduuCPhIpE1HdRaUWils04ktFGY_eXXt1JjRXnZIQ13q4o-dBTCgikxl_YZmr3EjcsJ7yt9w8=&c=KJGEjpjCCpREXylzSNvehY5XQ6p2tGRse-wOVu9zreC3XCrdhqQ0Xg==&ch=b57YQjOT11TzyPV0Q8jptPFLea-578r5GSjsNqqb4boW2a9h1gjgFg==]and we'll give you all the help and advice you need.

Yours sincerely,

Sean Kavanagh

A brief summary of what is happening + a very useful Fact Sheet for you
With the introduction of the Companies Act 2014 on 1st June 2015, all existing private
companies limited by shares, have to decide whether they wish to be a DAC or opt
 in to being the new simplified LTD.

If no choice has been made by a company as of 30th November 2016, they will automatically
be converted to an LTD.  However, failure to take action prior to this date may 
result in a corporate form that is unsuitable for the business of your company, 
and indeed may be deemed as a breach of the Directors' duties.

In order to help you decide on the best option for your company, we have put together
a fact sheet on the conversion process, together with a snapshot of the main differences
between a DAC and an LTD.  We can also provide you with guidance and paperwork in
order to convert to your desired company type in advance of the deadlines.
Click here to view our Fact Sheet

With conversion packages to LTD from as little as ?189* + vat per company (*Discounts
for multiple companies are available)  it makes excellent economic sense for you
 to contact us to see how we can help with a cost effective and efficient solution
for all your conversion needs.

NOW
is perhaps the best time of all for you to attend to the necessary secretarial work
to convert your company.

If a company is making an application to be restored within twelve months of being
struck off or dissolved it can apply directly to the Companies Registration Office.
This will avoid the necessity of engaging a solicitor and barrister and seeking 
a hearing in the High Court.

Dear Steve
,
As more and more international business is conducted in and from Ireland, the need for commercial documentation to be validated, certified or authenticated in some manner has increased considerably.
This inevitably involves attendance before a Notary Public followed by a visit to the Department of Foreign Affairs or an Embassy or even despatch of documents to the UK, where a particular country does not have consular representation in Ireland, in order to have subject documents Notarised, Apostilled or Legalised.
Here in CFI we have many years' experience in drafting documents which meet the requirements of overseas applicants in terms of both format and of content.  And, having agreed the content, we have arrangements in place to quickly move the papers to be authenticated between the various parties that need to be involved.
So, if any Irish registered companies under your care need, perhaps,
a 'Certificate of Good Standing' type document with Apostille or
a Power of Attorney to be Notarised  or
documents certified by the Companies Registration Office
Then simply contact my colleagues Karen Corcoran (
karen@formations.ie
) or Yolanda Roman (
yolanda@formations.ie
) and they will guide you through the process.
In the meantime, we have prepared a Factsheet on this topic which is available by clicking

.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
