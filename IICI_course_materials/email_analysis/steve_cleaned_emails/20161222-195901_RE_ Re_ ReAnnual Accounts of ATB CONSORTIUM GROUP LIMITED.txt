Hi

 

As per the update I got we don’t have any update from tech team so we don’t have any answer for the client. The person who is dealing with this was absent yesterday. We donot want to commit any more without tech team reply. So we are waiting. Sheraz told us that he will update us today so as soon as we will have any update we will reply customer. 

 

Hope you got my point on this it not in our hands to file the CT600.
