Belize is a closed directory so no one can see the shareholders unless
requested (like the bank)

 

He can use his own nominee if he wishes.

He could in theory use our nominee shareholder service but the belize agent
will want those details, and the company will not be able to open a bank
account

 

He should open 2 other belize companies with the 2 shareholders as
directors, and then these act as the nominee shareholder.

Either way all shareholders will have to disclose their documents to us and
the agent

 

So I think you need to find out in what way they don't want their names
known

 

Also

The capitalised and number of shares issued changes the price of the belize
company so find this out before committing to the sale

 

thanks
