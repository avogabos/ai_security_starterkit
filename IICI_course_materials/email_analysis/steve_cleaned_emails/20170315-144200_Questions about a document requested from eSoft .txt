Subject: Questions about a document requested from eSoft 
From: rana risheh <ranarisheh@hotmail.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Dear Steve,


I hope my email finds you well.


We might sign a contract with another party. One of eSoft's director will sign the contract. However, this party asks for a proof shows that this person is a director in eSoft and has the right to sign. What kind of document we can provide them in this case?


Another question please, how can we amend the list of person with significant controls listed on the confirmation statement? is that should be done online or through the form of eSoft's account on formations house?


Thank you for your help.


Best Regards,

Rana Risheh
