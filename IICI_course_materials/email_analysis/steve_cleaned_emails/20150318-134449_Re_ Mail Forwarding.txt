Mail Forwarding
Hi Steve,
Despite paying for mail
forwarding service, we have yet to receive any mail from you.  We are
aware that statutory mail would have been sent to the registered office since
its incorporation in 2013.  We have recently requested information from Companies
House which would have been sent to you in the last couple of weeks but we have
not received same.
Would you please look into this
as a matter of urgency.
Thank you.
Elaine.
