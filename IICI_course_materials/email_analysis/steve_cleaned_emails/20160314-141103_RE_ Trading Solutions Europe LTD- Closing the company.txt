Dear Account Centre Team,

We would like to close the company TSE ltd.

So the company has to prepare/file:

1) VAT final return
2) VAT de-register/filling form VAT 7
3) Preparing/filling companies house final statutory accounts and HMRC Company Tax return

Please let me know which information, initial docs you  need for preparing reports mentioned above? Also please clarify when company's bank accounts should be closed? Before filling accounts ?


Thank you and Best regards, 
Aksana Remsha.
