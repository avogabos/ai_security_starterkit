Dear Martin

 

Proof of address document confiramtion bill address _ energy is not
electricity bill, it is invoice for sending online postcards see attachment
confiramtion bill address _ energy_problem and it is not acceptable.

 

ID Card was issued in 2014 which does not fulfill the criteria of the
document to be dated within last 3 months.

 

Please arrange any one of the following proof of residential address
document in directors name and it must not be older than 3 months:

 

I. LAST 3 MONTHS UTILITY BILLS (WATER OR GAS OR ELECTRICITY)

or

I. LATEST PERSONAL BANK/CREDIT CARD STATEMENT. (ISSUE DATE, NAME, ADDRESS
AND ACCOUNT NUMBER MUST BE VISIBLE)

Dear Martin


Thank you for your order for UK company formation BUILDING AND FINANCIAL
SERVICES LIMITED.


 

But before we process the registration  we need following:

 

- Proof of Address for Director you sent is a mobile bill which is not
acceptable. Please note that for proof of address we can accept any of the
following documents only:

 

I. Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity)

OR

I. Latest personal bank/credit card statement. (issue date, name, address
and account number must be visible)

OR

I. Latest Council Tax Bill on directors/shareho0lders name (only for UK
residents)

 

- You have selected Directors Protection Service GBP 150 which will hide
director address in public records, but we can see director is also a
shareholder and company registrar consider director and shareholder separate
entities therefore directors address will be hidden but shareholders
address will be visible. In order to hide shareholders address you will
need Shareholders Privacy/Protection Service GBP 150. Please confirm if
you wish to use Shareholders Privacy/Protection Service too and arrange the
payment.

 

- You choose to use Company formation using customised Articles &
Memorandum of Association GBP 25. You are required to produce the Articles
& Memorandum of Association and send us the final draft as WORD document.

 

- And there is been an upgrade in due diligence procedure. From now on we
also need to maintain updated due diligence documents of our resellers and
for that we would need following documents from you Martin Groh. Please
provide scan color copies of following documents:

 

1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport (bearer signature and complete information
must be visible)

2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas
OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (issue date,
name, address and account number must be visible).

 

Please make sure that scans are clear and in readable size and format.

 

If above documents are not in English then we will need officially
translated notarized copies of documents with the originals.

 

Please do not send telephone, mobile, TV, internet bill or any other
document. If documents are not according to above mentioned instructions
then it will not be accepted.

 

Please provide us with above mentioned documents and information so that we
can further proceed with your application.

 

Regards

 

Steve
