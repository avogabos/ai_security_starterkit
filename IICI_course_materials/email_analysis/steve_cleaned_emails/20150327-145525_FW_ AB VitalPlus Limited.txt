Dear Charlotte,

The Rietumu ID that was connected to the company has been blocked. Please
let me know a number of another Rietumu ID that You will issue to the client
(he informed me that he will personally come to pick it up). I will then
prepare the bank forms that need to be signed.

Kind Regards,
