Order 185222 Wise Trade Platform Ltd
Good Morning,
unfortunately you 
didn't found
time to response to my email from friday so I request company documents 
again
for ordered and paid company above.
I'm sure something is 
wrong and
I expected more professionality for an experienced company like yours.
Here's my summary:
22/06/2015: order has been taken and payment has 
been done
by faster payment
25/06/2015: after all requestimng all details with 
your
order, you found out that you need this documents also signed
01/07/2015: you submitted a company registration 
number
which is unable to recognise with Seychelles registry.
01/07/2015: you requested all company documents 
signed; tis
has been returned to you on same day
03/07/2015: another request for company documents
(certificates etc) - no response
03/07/2015: check with Seychelles registry - no 
company
incorporated
03/07/2015: your given company number cannot be 
validated
and is different to typical registration numbers on Seychelles
03/07/2015: online chek in your companies mangement
 system -
there is no order or a company to find. your name check shows this 
company name
available.
I'm awaiting an immediate response to my email 
in this
matter !!!
