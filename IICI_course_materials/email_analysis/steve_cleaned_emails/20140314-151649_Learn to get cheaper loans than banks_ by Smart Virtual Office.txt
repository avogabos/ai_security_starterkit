Hi guys,
Long time no see, I am the CEO of Smart Virtual Office. I have something that you may be interested in.
If you are borrower
You have capital to jumpstart your company, but cannot get it from any sources.
The banks feel you do not have track record, if not the interest rates are too high.
Need funding but not ready to give up the company shares
If you are lender
Wish you have higher interest rates than the miserable 0.1%
Want to start investing but do not have huge capital
Let me present to you an alternative. Social Lending. In a nutshell, you borrow from many lenders. Lenders lend to many borrowers. You pay lower interests rates than you would pay to the bank, the borrowers get higher interest rates, cutting the bank out of their fat profits, power to the little people.
This way it can fund your PIC purchases, your new equipment purchase.
If you want to find out more as a lender or borrower, please come down to a presentation.
