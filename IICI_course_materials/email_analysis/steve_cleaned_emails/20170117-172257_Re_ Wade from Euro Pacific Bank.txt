Before we sign any document we need to know why did WorldWide Ventures  is
in the picture? We didn´t agree to put that company as a shareholder so we
dont know why we have to produce any document to remove it. Please we need
to talk seriously about our process. We are stucked and loosing money. It s
been more than 6 months. Explain us detailed why do we have to do this or
if you are going to solve it.

Re: Wade from Euro Pacific Bank
Thank you
Angela
Did you receive
any reply from the agent about WORLDWIDE VENTURES?  As per the corporate
documents they are a shareholder of which we will need corresponding
documentation as I have mentioned previously, alternative the agent will need
to provide the document to show that WORLDWIDE VENTURES no longer holds any
shares of the company.
Regards,
Wade Lambert
