owned by 2 separate NY Trusts that we have formed 50/50 (we have attached
the cover pages of the 2 trusts hereto).

 

The shareholders and Directors of the Belize LLC and BVI Company is to
remain off of public record but we will need some type of internal document
to provide to our bank etc.

 

The Director of both the BVI Company and Belize LLC will be a NY resident by
the name of Avrohom A. Faskowitz. We have attached his passport and recent
utility bill herewith. The Director is also to remain off of any public

formation and 300 GBP per year and the BVI Company will cost 500 GBP for
formation and 400 GBP per year.
