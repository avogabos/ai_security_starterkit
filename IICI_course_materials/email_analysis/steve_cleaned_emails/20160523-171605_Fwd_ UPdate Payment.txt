Hi there Felix,

I just wanted to confirm with you, that if I pay for the 3 month package
now. I won't have to active the phone and fax lines until I'm ready,
however I would still need the phone number and the fax number so I can put
them on the advertisement that will go out at a later date.

Warm Regards
Naidoo
