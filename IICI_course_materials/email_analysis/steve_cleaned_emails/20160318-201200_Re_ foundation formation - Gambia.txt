Steve

Thank you for that\u2026 one more question on the foundation is: what 
accounts (if any) are required to be filed?

We currently have two new clients moving "through" the system and who 
will require their foundations soon (both are currently waiting on year 
ends) with a further two due to follow. anticipated foundations by end 
of April are therefore 4, with 3-4 offshore companies in addition to 
this\u2026 do you have any flexibility on prices?

I will be completely honest, this is not a problem for occasional 
formations, but interest in our service has increased with the new UK 
dividend tax, so we are looking for a price competitive, efficient, fast 
and reliable "partner" that we can pass the bulk of new formations through

Les
