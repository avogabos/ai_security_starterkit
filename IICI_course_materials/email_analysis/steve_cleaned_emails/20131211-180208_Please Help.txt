Steve,

I once again tried to process my card but another attempt in vain.

Mine is a VISA International Debit card. I'm selecting VISA in the card
type section. Is this where I'm going wrong? Do I need to select DEBIT Card
instead of Visa? But if I select Debit Card, it asks for ISSUE NUMBER and
My Card doesn't have one. No new cards have it I believe. I'm really struck
here.

I went to my bank today and they said there's loads of formalities to
transfer funds to UK as the rules have changed a lot for cross border
payments as per the Reserve Bank of India so there are many bank
formalities which seems time consuming.

I'm looking forward to your help as the formation is getting delayed.

Regards,
Pratik Roy
