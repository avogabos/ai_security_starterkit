Dear All

 

RE: BVI incorporations only

 

Could everyone be aware that the current bvi corporate documents are very
large.( 1 binded folder + USB/Company stamp/Company Seal)

 

The charges to ship are very expensive, so such as documents will cost:

 

1.        VIA UK ROYAL MAIL recorded delivery £65.00

2.       Via courier; please check with myself or nadya and we will obtain a
quote for you.

 

As royal mail can be unpredictable at times, option 2 would be the safer
option for customers:

 

Regards, Tahir
