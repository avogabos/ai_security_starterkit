Hello,

I tried calling the number you provided, I could not get through. I am not quite sure why I cannot receive your emails. I have been getting emails all day from other clients. You can attempt to fax (302-739-6483) the document if you would like, but usually when things are faxed in the quality is still poor. If you do decide to fax the document please be sure to put it to my attention and to provide the reference number 20172882214. Please advise.

Thank you
