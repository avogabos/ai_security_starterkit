Subject: Certificate of Incumbency, Bank Account 
Hello Steve,
I have received the documents.  Thank you.  There was no Certificate of
Incumbency with the documents though which is also generally required by
the
banks:  how can I get one sent to me?
I also have no heard anything back about the appointment with the bank in
Singapore for next week.   
As its too close to the date now it will need to be pushed back to week of
April 5th.
I can't remind you again how important this is as I'm having to use
personal
funds for my business expenses without a bank account, and we're working
on
this since December last year.  As I'm paying extra for this service I
find
this not very acceptable.
Kind Regards,
Reto
