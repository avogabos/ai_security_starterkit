IMF: tax breaks vital to boost growth

The IMF has told George Osborne he must do more to support UK innovation if the Government is to boost growth and raise living standards. The Fund is urging policymakers in the advanced world to increase spending on R&D, which it claimed would pay for itself through a “large growth dividend”. It added that well-designed tax breaks that encouraged private sector spending together with public investment in basic research were “critical” to increase productivity and stop the world falling into a low growth trap. At the same time, the Fund said tax breaks that were targeted directly at SMEs could be counterproductive. “Preferential tax treatment of small companies is too blunt an instrument to foster entrepreneurial activity efficiently and can create a “small business trap”, the IMF warned.

HMRC aims to stop Scots dodging higher taxes

In the context of possible income tax increases in Scotland, HMRC has indicated it has put in place tight tests and processes, and has full data on all Scottish taxpayers to prevent residents dodging liabilities. The Guardian’s Severin Carrell notes there are already fewer and less wealthy additional rate taxpayers as a proportion in Scotland than the UK as a whole, at 0.7% versus 1.1% and earning £310,000 on average against £370,000 in 2010/11. A Scottish Government briefing paper has identified a further complication, Mr Carrell adds, with tax flight risk deemed greater for those working for non-Scottish companies because executives in London-based firms could more easily change primary residence. A 2014 Guardian investigation found at least 70% of Scotland’s GDP was controlled by non-Scottish companies, compared to 36% of the UK’s.

Business rates overhaul could boost London

The Standard’s James Ashton says that George Osborne’s move to devolve a greater share of business rates revenue to local authorities will provide a huge boost for London. Soon, he says, councils will retain 100% of the proceeds of business rates but pass a bigger portion to the Greater London Authority, “giving the next London mayor an extra £1bn to play with.” Mr Ashton also highlights that retailers have benefitted from the overhaul of business rates set out in last month’s Budget - some 600,000 small firms will now pay no business rates at all and another 50,000 will benefit from tapered relief. Meanwhile, Kate Nicholls of the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers writes in the Guardian that the Government could have done more “to bring the local business tax regime into the 21st century.”

Stamp duty tax loophole could save buyers thousands

The Telegraph highlights a little-known tax loophole which could mean buy-to-let investors and buyers of second homes are exempt from the higher rates of stamp duty that come into force today. For existing property owners to be exempt, they must be buying a main residence rather than a second home or investment property and have previously owned another main residence that they sold at any time before the announcement of the stamp duty surcharge on November 26 2015. Anyone who fits these criteria has until November 26 2018 – three years after the announcement in last year’s Autumn Statement – to buy an additional home without paying the extra stamp duty.

EBT crackdown will target Rangers stars

Former Rangers FC players could be forced to pay back millions of pounds following a clampdown on Employee Benefit Trusts. Graeme Souness and former owner Sir David Murray are among those who have made millions from the tax-free ‘loans’. However, earlier this month George Osborne promised to pursue all individuals who have benefited from “disguised remuneration schemes” – of which the EBT introduced by Sir David was a prime example. Rangers players and senior staff during the club’s use of the EBT between 2001 and 2010 are said to have earned £47.65m from the scheme.

Private equity execs face bigger tax on ‘carried interest’

The Treasury is to tax carried interest wholly as income if deals last fewer than three years, and partly if groups withdraw from them within 40 months.

FIRMS

 

PwC change could prove the value of audit

James Ashton in the Standard speculates on the identity of the next chairman of PwC. Appointing either James Chalmers, the firm's head of assurance, or Richard Oldfield, the lead audit partner on the firm’s HSBC account, would “go some way to proving that audit has not been forever marginalised,” suggests Mr Ashton. He adds: “What better way to emphasise that audit is still central to the business than for PwC to pick an auditor to lead it forward?” Also in the running for the role are finance chief Warwick Hunt and managing partner Kevin Ellis.

Attempts to strangle buy-to-let market won't work

Matthew Lynn in the Telegraph argues that new rules from the Bank of England to clamp down on the buy-to-let industry will only distort the housing market further. He says there have already been numerous clampdowns on lending in the wake of the financial crisis, and the market remains dysfunctional. The solution, he says, is to build more homes, rather than tinker with existing rules.

ECONOMY

 

UK current account deficit hits new high

The UK's current account deficit widened to a record high in the final quarter of last year, according to data from the ONS. In the three months to December it was £32.7bn, the equivalent of 7% of GDP, and for the whole of 2015, it came to £96.2bn or 5.2% of GDP. Both figures are the highest since records began in 1948. At the same time, ONS figures showed the UK economy grew 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, higher than previous estimates of 0.5%, and as a result, the economy grew by 2.3% for the whole of 2015, rather than the 2.2% previously predicted.

Mortgage rates hit record lows

New research shows that mortgage rates for two and three-year fixed rate deals fell to record lows in February, with borrowers accessing the largest number of products since 2008. The average two-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 2.54% in February, down from 2.56% in January. While the average three-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 2.92%, down from 3.01% the previous month, according to analysis of data compiled by the Mortgage Advice Bureau. The average five-year fixed rate deal also declined, from 3.27% in January to 3.25%, edging towards August 2015’s record low of 3.24%.

National living wage takes effect

The new national living wage comes into force today, meaning workers over the age of 25 must receive an hourly rate of at least £7.20 - an increase of 50p. A report by the Social Market Foundation think tank warns small firms will see wage bills rise at triple the rate of bigger companies. Those with fewer than 250 employees will grow on average by 1.5%, compared to 0.6% for businesses with 250 to 4,999 staff. The Guardian says middle class households who rely on cash-in-hand cleaners, gardeners and car washers are among the employers deemed most likely to try to avoid paying the increased minimum wage. And a report compiled by Care England and PwC also warns that half the residential homes and domiciliary care services for the elderly will become "financially unviable" in some parts of the country because of the national living wage.

Fugitive fraudsters ordered to pay £109m

A father and son who went on the run before a fraud trial have been ordered by HMRC to pay back £109m immediately or have 14 years added to their terms. Geoffrey and Gareth Johnson were part of an 18-strong crime gang who stole £20m in a mobile phone VAT carousel fraud. After fleeing the country, they were jailed in their absence for 10 and 12 years respectively. The pair have been tracked to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where they are running a plant hire firm.
