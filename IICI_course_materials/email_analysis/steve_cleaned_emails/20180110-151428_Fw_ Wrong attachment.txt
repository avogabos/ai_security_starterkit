Hello Steve,
The letter in question is an HMRC access code and password received around the November ending according to Sean/ Shawn.
This letter is way overdue. Your company's first attempt at sending this was on the 3/01/18.
Please check and help as my accountant is extremely worried with this delay.
Regards
Jerry
