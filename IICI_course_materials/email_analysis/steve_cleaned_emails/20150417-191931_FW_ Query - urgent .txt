Dear Delphine,

Could you please advise me on the below query:

*	can we open a company with name KMPG BANK with no bank licence but
only like a general trading Gambian company? 
*	if company will be a limited share company, or similar, it must use
the appendix IBC (like KMPG BANK IBC) or it can use other appendix like LTD
or GMBH or AG (like KMPG BANK LTD)? 
*	how many shareholders are necessary? and can CEO be not resident in
Gambia? 
*	what is the minimum share capital? 
*	what is your costs to form this type of company, if it is possible?

 

Thank you

Dear Delphine,
Could you please advise me on the below query:
can we open a company with name KMPG
     BANK with no bank licence but only like a general trading Gambian company?
if company will be a limited share
     company, or similar, it must use the appendix IBC (like KMPG BANK IBC) or
     it can use other appendix like LTD or GMBH or AG (like KMPG BANK LTD)?
how many shareholders are necessary?
     and can CEO be not resident in
Gambia
?
what is the minimum share capital?
what is your costs to form this type
     of company, if it is possible?
Thank you
