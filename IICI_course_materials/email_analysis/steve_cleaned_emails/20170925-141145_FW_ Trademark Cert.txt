Dear Mr Abed,

 

I hope you are well, 

During our office move we checked all our files and found we are in
possession of a Trade mark certificate. We are happy to retain and store
this for you however if yo would like us to post it to you please let me
know to where I can send it.

You also need to advise on the registered address as it has not been renewed
for some time, and any other services you require from us such as accounts

 

Thanks

 

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
