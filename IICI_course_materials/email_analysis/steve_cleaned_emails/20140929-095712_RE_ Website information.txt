Dear Chris,

 

The company is indeed incorporated. The issues are CH has changed the LLP
filing system, meaning we aren't currently integrated as we were before, but
it is being updated.

The surest way to check is to go to www.companieshouse.gov.uk and check here
for the company.

 

Many Thanks

 

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte/Steve

 

When I logon to your website and look under LLP management I get this
screen.

 



 

Can you please confirm that the LLP is incorporated and that your system
needs updating.

 

Thanks

Chris
