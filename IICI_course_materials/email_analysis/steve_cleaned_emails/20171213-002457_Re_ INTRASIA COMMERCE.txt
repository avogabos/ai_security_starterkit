Hello Steve

Thank you so much for your assistance!

Sure, I'll wait for your letter.

Please take to consideration that removing my name from the company's
(prevoius or new) directors/owners public list is very important.

If the restoration possible, please let me know the price of your services
to hide my name from the public accessible information about the restored
company.
There is my name in it now.

Best regards,
Gleb Erokhin
