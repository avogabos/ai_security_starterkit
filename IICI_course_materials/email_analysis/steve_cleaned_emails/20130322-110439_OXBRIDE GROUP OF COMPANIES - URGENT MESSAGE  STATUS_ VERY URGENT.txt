Dear Steve, 
 
Thank you for your recent e-mails, which I have recieved. I have now spoken with Karim Rajani, and I would be grateful if you could kindly re-despatch the documentation that you e-mailed me which needs to be completed by Karim. I believe that there are three attachments required to be completed in order for the Company to be formed. Please would you undertake this as a matter of urgency today. I am unable to open the attachments on my system. Please would you also provide Karim with a clear list of what is required from him in order to complete the formation process, including the payment details. 
 
You have confirmed that all documents in respect of DR HS Gupta are in order. 
 
Once you have done this, kindly copy me in to the e-mail. 
 
With Best Wishes
