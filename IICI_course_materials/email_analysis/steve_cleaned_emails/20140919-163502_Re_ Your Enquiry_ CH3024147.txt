Dear Sir

WORK MAGAZINE LIMITED - 05682808.

Thank you for your e mail concerning the restoration of the above company.

Unfortunately this company cannot be restored to the register by using the administrative restoration procedure as it is out of time, however the company can be restored by an order of court.  I must point out that this option is only available until 01/10/2015.

You will need to make an application to have the company restored to the register.  This application would consist of a Claim Form CPR (Part 8) which would need to be sealed by a court, and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration. In this case the company was removed from the register for non filing of statutory documents.

If the company is going to remain on the register you will be required to file the following documents and fees prior to the Court Order being made.

Accounts for 31/01/2007, 31/01/2008, 31/01/2009, 31/01/2010, 31/01/2011, 31/01/2012 and 31/01/2013.

Please note the accounts for 31/01/2014 will be due for filing by 30/10/2014, if the company has not been restored prior to the due date then we will also require the accounts for 31/01/2014 to be filed prior to the restoration.

Annual returns for 21/01/2007, 21/01/2008, 21/01/2009, 21/01/2010, 21/01/2011, 21/01/2012, 21/01/2013 and 21/01/2014 along with the filing fee of £200.

You can obtain further advice on how to restore a company by logging onto the Treasury Solicitors website - ?http://www.tsol.gov.uk? and downloading their notes for guidance on company restoration.

Yours Faithfully
