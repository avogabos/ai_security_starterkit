Dear Steve,
Thank you for your reply. 
I thought the opening a UK bank account service for foreign residents is fully guaranteed, isn't it?
Kind Regards,
Svetoslav

Dear
Svetoslav
If
you have official UK residence then you have very high chances of getting a UK
bank account, people who are non-UK resident have very low chances to get a UK
bank account.
If
you provide your friend’s UK address then you will need to provide proof of
address document in your name.
In
the bank account meeting company director/s will be required to bring in their
original passport, last 3 months utility bill (water or gas or electricity),
last 3 months personal bank statement and signed company share certificates.
Regarding
VAT, yes you will be trading through a UK company but since you are not located
in UK so company’s actual trading will be address of your residing country.
Regards
Steve…..
