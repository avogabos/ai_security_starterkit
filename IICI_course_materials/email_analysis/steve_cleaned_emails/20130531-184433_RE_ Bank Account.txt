Dear Mr. Steve,
 
Thanks for the details sent. But those are normal procedures to be done by all.
 
 
What I am asking is suppose I need to do some agreement with any Govt. Organisation or private If I am asked to submit a copy of the MOA what shall we submit ???
Because in the back office I could not find anything. The material which you sent , fully filled in with our names . address, objectives etc etc would be probarbly the right thing.
 
Do we have that ready ?? It is just not 2 sheets of paper, its a set of papers with all the details of the company.
I hope you got me. 
Straight and simple if we are asked to submit our companies MOA what shall we submit ??
 
Will wait for your reply please. ASAP 


With sincere compliments & best wishes....

Dear Mr.
Steve,

 

Thanks for
your  mail informing that the Royal Bank of Scotland has not accepted our
application for account opening.

 

We would
request all our documents to be given back to us on an urgent basis , which
they had taken from us. When we 

do not
qualify to be their customer , our documents shall be thrown away by them, I do
not want that.

 

We want
all our documents back, we are ready to pay charges if any, for sending
it back. 

Requesting
you to kindly expedite the matter.

 

Secondly
we could not find any proper MOA in our Back office. We tried as you said but
we found only  2 pages with basically nothing constructive written in it.

 

Kindly let
us know at the earliest where we can get the full version of our Memorandum of
Association in details. It is urgently required by some competent authority.

 

For : Dr. Sir.
Siddhartha Das Gupta 






With sincere compliments & best
wishes....
