Hi Mam,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta.
 
I Thank you once again for your time yesterday.
 
For your ready reference I do hereby summarise the discussion herewith :
 
1. We would get a reply to the mails we sent you, in a reasonable time.
2. Bank Account number of HSBC has been given to you along with the Sort code.
3. The VAT application will be made immediately , so that we get it in time to start the business, as we have lost 4 months.
4. Regarding Bank account in RBS-- let it go in its own way.
5. Any official documents that comes for us will be handed over to Bruno, taking and acknowledgement from him .
6.Regarding the phone calls received ---the message will be transferred to us immediately ( which I got one yesterday). Here I would just suggest that if you could inform the person assigned for this job to just say different things in different times, for e.g -- He is in a meeting, or he is out of office, or he is out of country, if required the mail id may be given judiciously --- fortuneventures@outlook.com  etc etc.
7. I would send the website templates today so that the site is built fast, you may kindly inform the concerned person to act in a quick way. In the initial days we might require to get in touch with him often , so his phone or contact number may be required. You can also give them my India number +919051433333   or  +917890033333. Once we have the admin in our control we may do necessary changes. 
8. Logo of the company will be sent to you today for the designing part of the website as well as the stationaries.
