Hello Oliver,

I am Orkan from Turkey, i wan to open a UK company but i have some questions.

1- I do not want people to see my company owner name when they search on google or internet. I dont want nobody to see my name on internet. Can it be possible?

2- I want to register company address and vat number.

3- I want an offhore bank account at Switzerland for my UK company. Is it possible? We will use this company to sell wholesale textile products but i do not want to pay tax at UK so i want customers to pay the goods price to UK company at switzerland bank account. I hope you understand what i mean. If you have an idea, please help me, i do not want to pay tax wtih my sales and invoices. I will create invoice on my UK company but will give switzerland bank account. Is this a solution not to pay tax? I think you can know it well.

I wait your email. Thank you so much..

Regards.
