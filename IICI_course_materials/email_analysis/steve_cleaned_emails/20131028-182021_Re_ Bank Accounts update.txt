Hi Charlotte/Steve

I have not had a reply to my email dated Oct 21.

Can you please tell me if Raj has had this new letter from the Seychelles
(as you mentioned in your email dated Oct 16th) and is he now happy with
this.

I have emailed Anthony's bank form to you and will mail the hard copy to
you tomorrow.

Aleks is getting proof of his new address soon and will send on.

Can you please let us know if that is all you need and that the accounts
will be set up soon.

Thanks
Chris

Hi Charlotte/Steve
Please find attached the completed bank form from Anthony.
Per your previous email I never received a copy of the email Raj.
Did this new letter get to him on the 17th?
Please let me have an update on this bank account.
Regards
Chris

Yes we require the letter for Anthony, and the proof from Aleks.
The Seychelles letter for RBS was still not correct and so im trying again. Raj is being very helpful but it seems the compliance team keep changing the requirements. I really do hope I can get this sorted asap.
I apologise again for all the time taken, we didn’t realise there would be issues, but it seems since the compliance changes at the bank, this is a problem for us with other clients too and therefore I am pushing to resolve as soon as we can.
I expect another letter from the Seychelles solicitor tomorrow morning. I will email to raj straightaway for him to get the compliance team to check. (I will cc you)
Thanks
Charlotte

Bank Accounts update
Hi Charlotte/Steve
In the absence of any replies to my latest emails, I have to make the assumption that the only item you are waiting for is a Letter of Good Standing from Anthony.
He will complete this and send to me soon.
The bank is also waiting for proof of address from Aleks, who has this in hand.
Is there anything else?
I would appreciate a reply as its the only way I know if you need anything.
Regards
Chris
