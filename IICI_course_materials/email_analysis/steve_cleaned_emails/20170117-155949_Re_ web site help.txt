Dear Steve,

Thank you for your note.

I have been trying to find companies to restructure my website and host it but I have already paid for the hosting etc to your company and they ask me to rebuild it and host it altogether. 

Can you help me with the hosting part at least?
How do I give that to a new web design company? Do I have to pay them again for something I have already paid for?

Please help me at least on this I am in the darkâ€¦

Thanks a million in advance.

Best regards,

Maria
