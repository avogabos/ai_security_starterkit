Dear Customer,

 

As the contact person for a British Virgin Islands (BVI) registered company
with Formations House we would to inform you of a recent amendment to the
BVI Business Companies Act 2004.

 

The amendment came into force from 31st March 2017 and requires both new and
existing BVI companies to file a Register of Directors with the Registrar of
Corporate Affairs. This amendment is a response to the policies enforced
under FATF 40, whereby there was a recommendation that directors
information on companies to be maintained on a central register.  This
measure ensures that the BVI remains compliant with international financial
initiatives, particularly those initiatives relating to the automatic
exchange of information and the fight against money laundering and the
financing of terrorism.

 

The first registration of Directors requires both a government fee and an
agent fee for the local agent to file with the government. The combined
first cost for an existing BVI company will be £600 if filed before 21st
July 2017. After this the cost to file will increase. Failure to file at all
will incur a penalty and the company to be removed from the register.

For new BVI company incorporations, we have increased the initial cost
accordingly, to include the cost of the filing of Register of Directors.

 

The government filing fees for all BVI companies has also been increased and
there is a planned further increase for renewals that fall after January
2018.

You will receive a request to renew your BVI company service at the current
increased price.

Please also bear in mind that should your capitalisation of the company by
significantly increased since the last renewal period, we may need to charge
a higher renewal fee due to the increased Government fee for the higher
capital companies.

 

Should you require to make a change to the Register of Directors at any time
during the year, the fee may be between £160 and £260 pounds dependent upon
the changes and the companies capitalisation. This fee may increase after
January 2018 in line with the planned government fee increases.

 

Please note that the Register of Directors will not be publicly available
and may be obtained only by the relevant BVI company, its registered agent,
any other person authorised in writing by the company to have access to it,
by court order or on the request of a competent authority acting in the
exercise of its powers or dealing with a matter for which is has authority
under an enactment. This last reference is included in order to deal with
obligations that may be imposed by automatic exchange of tax information
arrangements such as US FATCA or the OECD Common Reporting Standard, other
mutual legal assistance legislation or its powers as a financial services
regulator, tax authority or law enforcement agency.

 

Formations House always strives to offer the most competitive and attractive
pricing options in the market, our prices for almost all of our products
have rarely ever been subject to price increases but due to the nature of
the change at governmental level, we have to alter our pricing accordingly.
Subject to the Governmental fee being increased by the BVI we must reflect
this in our new updated pricing if we wish to continue offering this
jurisdiction.

 

*Summary

-    All existing BVI companies must file a registry of directors, which is
not publicly accessible.

-    The fee for existing BVI companies which shall be £600 if filed by 21st
July 2017. There will be government-imposed fines if the registry is not
filed by this date.

-    All new BVI companies will be incorporated with a registry of directors
as part of the incorporation process; the price of incorporating a new BVI
company has been updated to reflect this addition government fee.*
