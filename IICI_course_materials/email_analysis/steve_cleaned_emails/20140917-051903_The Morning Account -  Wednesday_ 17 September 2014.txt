TAX

OECD unveils tax plans
Moves to tackle corporate tax avoidance on a global scale have been unveiled by the OECD. The action plan is aimed at multinational companies that shrink their tax bills by shifting their profits from one country to another. The OECD says 44 nations making up 90% of the world economy favour its plan. Announcing the proposals, the OECD's head of tax, Pascal Saint-Amans, said that they would "change the rules of the game" by making sure companies paid taxes in the country where profits were generated. At present, firms can exploit agreements intended to avoid double taxation of profits by using them to obtain double tax deductions instead. They also use internal billing procedures to ensure that profits are registered in countries where corporate tax levels are lower. Under the OECD plan, a country-by-country model would require firms to declare their revenue, profit, staffing and tax paid in each jurisdiction. "There was a lot of scepticism about whether the OECD would be able to do this. This is an enormous statement of intent," Richard Collier, a tax partner at PwC, said.

Stamp duty imposed on "ordinary families buying ordinary homes"
Londoners now face a £5,000 stamp duty "bombshell" due to the rise in average house prices, as stamp duty is levied at 4%, rather than 3%, on properties sold for over £500,000. Richard Snook, a senior economist at PwC, said: "The average London property is now eligible for a minimum £20,000 tax bill." TaxPayers' Alliance CEO Jonathan Isaby stated: "It's becoming a tax on ambition." The Daily Express' leader supports the reform of stamp duty, calling the tax "unreasonable" and a tax on "ordinary families buying ordinary homes". Elsewhere, the Daily Mail notes that due to rising house prices, many who were not previously subject to IHT now face paying it. "We also need the inheritance tax threshold to rise significantly to more like £500,000. The nearly-affluent - the families in three or four bedroom houses who live in affluent areas - should be taken out of inheritance tax so that they can focus on the genuinely wealthy," says Stephen Herring, head of taxation at the IoD.

Britain's tax regime uncompetitive
The Telegraph's Allister Heath describes Britain's tax system as not fit for purpose and calls it "complex, confused, irrational, punitive and in urgent need of root and branch reform". His comments come as the Tax Foundation, a US think-tank, places Britain 21st out of 34 OECD countries for international tax competitiveness. Britain's score is hurt by its complexity, stamp duty, a highish personal allowance for CGT and the patent box tax relief scheme. Estonia was found to be the most competitive country with New Zealand coming second while the US and France were 33rd and 34th respectively. Mr Heath says "we will need some brave and far-sighted volunteers in Westminster" to tear up the tax system and start again.

Labour group advises new tax on residents
The High Street Advisory Group, created by Labour to examine ways of boosting ailing town centres, has recommended introducing a new tax on residents to fund an expansion of Business Improvement Districts. At present, BIDs are funded by local businesses, but the report advocates significantly increasingly their influence through new funding. Details of the report have emerged after renewed calls for an overhaul to the business rates system.

US should tackle tax code before it's too late
Mort Zuckerman, executive chairman of Boston Properties, comments in the FT on the rise of US firms seeking inversion merger deals. Mr Zuckerman states that "only a masochist would embrace [the US] 35% rate rather than 12% in Ireland or the Asian average of 21.9%" and that US companies have no faith in a dysfunctional Congress to reform the country's "labyrinthine" tax code. Mr Zuckerman suggests Congress use the recent furore over Burger King's purchase of Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons to push reform for the benefit of business and taxpayers, before the numbers opting to invert increase to the point where the US tax base is eroded to beyond a reasonable position from which comprehensive tax reform could be implemented.

Anti-money laundering push hurts BVI
HSBC and Standard Chartered, both with a strong presence in Hong Kong, have been making it more difficult for British Virgin Island companies to open bank accounts in the Chinese territory, as a result of strengthening compliance with money laundering rules. Experts say BVI's reputation also suffered after a mass leak of investor names, while France put BVI on a black list for providing information to regulators too slowly. Samoa and the Seychelles have benefitted from BVI's fall in Chinese incorporations with rises in registrations of 38% and 24% respectively.

Scotland might have to offer tax breaks to wealthy foreigners
Andrew Watters, director and tax specialist at Thomas Eggar, has said an independent Scotland may have to offer wealthy 'non-doms' a tax break in order to attract investment. Mr Watters said the non-dom rules, which other countries do not operate, essentially make the UK a tax haven and would allow wealthy individuals who have a father born in Scotland to domicile themselves in Scotland and claim residency in England, thereby sheltering income 'offshore' in Scotland.

HMRC wins Sportech  appeal
Sportech has announced that the Upper Tribunal has ruled in favour of HMRC's appeal, in relation to its Spot the Ball game. Sportech had argued that the game is one of chance and not of skill - and therefore not liable for VAT. The company is required to repay the £93m it received from HMRC in June 2014.

INDUSTRY

Companies must explain executive pay
New guidelines from the Financial Reporting Council will ask businesses to explain how bosses' pay packages are aligned with financial performance and to better outline their prospects for long-term stability. The FRC also said companies should be able to claw back bonuses. The updated version of the Combined Code said that companies should put in place structures to allow them to recover, withhold and defer remuneration if evidence reveals poor standards of behaviour. David Styles, the regulator's director of corporate governance, said the words "recruit, retain, motivate" had been dropped from the code's approach to setting top directors' pay as companies "were throwing it in our face when they received complaints about pay levels." Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the FRC, said the previous focus on retention "tended to promote pay escalation and leap frogging", rather than long-term interests. A new "viability statement" should be published by companies looking forward at least a year and should state risks faced and plans to mitigate them.

Uneven debt burden
R3 reports that 47% of British adults are in debt, shouldering Britain's £1.5trn debt bill with a third of those owing money to five or more organisations. Stuart Frith, chair of R3's personal insolvency committee, says: "The UK's personal debt burden is eye-watering, but it's especially worrying to see how unevenly spread this burden is."

WEALTH MANAGEMENT

Ex-wealth manager banned for misleading clients
Peter Carron, a former partner at St James's Place, has been fined £300,000 and banned from working in financial services for selling clients investments in companies which he owned without full disclosure. Mr Carron sold £2.4m of such investments between 2004 and 2010 to 11 clients who then lost £2.2m when the companies subsequently went bust, the FCA said. St James's Place paid out £1.9m in compensation.

ECONOMY

UK inflation rate down to 1.5%
The annual rate of UK inflation fell in August as the cost of petrol, food and non-alcoholic drinks declined. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell to 1.5% from 1.6% in August, the ONS said. It means the BoE remains under little pressure to raise interest rates in order to keep CPI inflation at or below its target rate of 2%. Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation also saw a reduction, to 2.4%, from 2.5% the previous month. Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks fell by 1.1%, marking their steepest fall for more than a decade. However, separate labour market figures due today are expected to show average earnings in the three months from May to July were up by just 0.5% on a year ago, only a third of the pace of price inflation.

Wealthy Scots could head south
One in seven Scottish millionaires would head south if Scotland votes Yes, according to a report compiled by Spear's magazine and consultancy firm WealthInsight. Around 15% of the wealthiest Scots, with a total net worth of £8bn, have their primary business in England and fear uncertainty over the tax regime and financial stability in an independent Scotland, according to the report. Meanwhile, Sir Sean Connery's brother has said the actor is unable to visit the country to provide support for the Yes campaign due to the number of days he is allowed to spend in the country as a tax exile.
