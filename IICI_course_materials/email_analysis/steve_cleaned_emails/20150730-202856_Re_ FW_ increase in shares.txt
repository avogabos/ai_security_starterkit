Dear Majid
Share capital has been increased to HKD 100 million for all of your
5 Hong Kong companies.
Attach are the applications which were submitted to increase
share capital for all of your 5 Hong Kong companies.
You will see that 2 shares for all the companies have been assigned
to WORLDWIDE VENTURES LIMITED. It is necessary for Hong Kong companies to have
a local shareholder for atleast a year. After completion of 1 year of company registration
you can transfer shares from WORLDWIDE VENTURES LIMITED (local agent) to
yourself.
I am working on arranging certified share transfer document from
Hong Kong registry for all the companies, please allow a week time for me to
arrange these.
Regards
Steve

Dear Majid
This is to inform you that share capital for MAJESTIC FUND
MANAGEMENT is now increased to HKD 100 million. We have asked registry to send
us the copy of the document showing increase in share capital. As soon as the
document is available I will email it you.
And now we have filed increase in shares for all your other Hong
Kong companies, please 2-3 working days for processing. As soon as it is done,
I will update you.

Dear Majid
The increase in shares application is submitted for MAJESTIC
FUND MANAGEMENT.
The Hong Kong registry came back to us today asking for some
missing information. Some of the data was corrupted while filing the
application online. We have re-submitted the application and waiting for a
response from Hong Kong registry.
I will contact you as soon as I have an update.

Dear Majid
We have submitted application for allotment of shares to
increase the share capital of Hong Kong company. Since we have not done this
before, so we have submitted application for only 1 company now to see if
everything is correct.
Once the shares are allotted and share capital is increased we
will then process the order companies. This will take a little time but
hopefully we will try our best to complete the process within this week.

Steve

Dear Majid

Please advice how you wish to proceed?
