Hi Aleks,


No it is not difficult  to change the address later, when address change, you just need to send an email to bank and they will update their records.

?Hi Steve,



Can you please let me know if it's difficult to change address in the future? The reason why I'm asking is that I might change my personal office address in next 6 - 12 month.



Thanks



Aleks

Hi Steve,

Thanks you for your reply.

I'm not sure which address I need to provide. Is it supposed to be UK address or Seychelles address?
