Bonjour Delphine,

J'ai répondu que le directeur principal de la société était M. GRUPPOSO
Mario, mais je ne sais pas si c'est cela que l'on nous demande.

Merci pour votre aide. Et est-ce que je dois repayer?

 

Bien à vous,

 

Jane,

MCE GROUP

Dear Customer,

 

This is to inform you that Confirmation Statement for SPEA MA LIMITED has
been rejected by Companies House due to company has no information on PSC

**All UK companies will now need to keep a register of People with
