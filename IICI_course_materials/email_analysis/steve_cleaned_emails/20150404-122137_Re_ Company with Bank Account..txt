Steve,
I’m a seasoned expat & as such have not had a
residential address for a very long time – living in company property.
The opportunity has arisen for me to go as a consultant in
my field of experience “Mine Maintenance”.
I therefore require a company, bank account & the
registration that goes with the company.
I’ll be the sole director at present – should there be a
need to expand then I’d like that opportunity.
Your opinion regards my documentation would be greatly
appreciated.
Best Regards.
