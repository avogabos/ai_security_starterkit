We arrange this as part of the license application. 

You can do banking actiivites outside gambia, however there may be local
restrictions such in UK, so depending on what they are offering we would
recommend how to make use of the license

ON our website: You cannot do any banking/financal activity outside Gambia.
However you can open a representative office in any other jurisdiction for
consultancy purpose only.


Question from customer: What's the requirement for the sponsoring bank, e.g.
its registered country?



Our response: The sponsoring bank will be one in gambia with a swift code
and the ability to montioring.

 

 

Customer question again: I cannot find a Gambian bank to be the sponsoring
bank. Could you help?

 

 

Please advice
