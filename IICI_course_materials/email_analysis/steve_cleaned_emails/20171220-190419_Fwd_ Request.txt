Dear Sir or Madam,

Please advise on the costs arising if we submit an English company (LTD) to
your administration:
- what will be our costs for filing all the changes (the Director and the
Shareholder will be ours).

 We will then need to prepare statements, please advise the fees (for both
zero and non-zero statements).

The company will then be subject to official liquidation. Therefore, I am
interested in the costs, dates and procedure of liquidation.

Thank you ib advance.
Best regards,
Ekaterina
