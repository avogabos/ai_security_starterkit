Dear Angela
Again attach is the form which
is to be filled by your Notary Public Office required for BVI company
formation.
For notarization documents must
be stamp by public notary in Dominican Republic. Also you need to arrange
English translation of these documents and translation document must also be
notarized.
Regarding HONG KONG it is in
process but on hold, I was told by our Support Team that you have been emailed
to resend copies of passports because a single digit of passport number is
missing. Please check your email and other emails
messin@marquezsarraff.com
and
julian@marquezsarraff.com
if you
received the email from
support@formationshouse.com
.
Please also check the SPAM/JUNK section and arrange passport copies as
required.
And if required you can speak to Mr. Shawn or Ms. Rachel in our
support team at
+44-207-016-2728
from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday.
Regards
Steve…
