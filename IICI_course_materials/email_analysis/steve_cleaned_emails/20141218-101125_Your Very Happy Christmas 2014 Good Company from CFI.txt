Psssssssst! Any idea where the 'X' in Xmas comes from?

Did You Know?
While some have objected to using the term "Xmas" as an abbreviation for "Christmas,"
this particular form of shorthand has been around for hundreds of years.
In fact, the "X" in "Xmas" is actually the symbol for "Chi"-the first letter in 
the Greek spelling of the word "Christos," or Christ. Use of the letter "X" as an
abbreviation for Christ's name is over 1,000 years old, and the term "Xmas" has 
been used in English as far back as the 18th century.

It's / Christmas joke time!

Q. What kind of motorbike does Santa ride?

A.   A Holly Davidson, of course!

Where's Santa?

Oooooooops!

Knock Knock!

Who's there?
Rabbit.
Rabbit who?
Rabbit up carefully,  it's a present!
I believe in Santa

Just before Xmas, an honest politician, a generous boss and 		Santa Claus all got
into the lift (elevator) at the Ritz Hotel in London.  		As the lift travelled from
the 5th floor down to the ground level, 		one-by-one they noticed a £50 note lying
on the lift's floor.

Which one picked up the £50 note, and handed it in at reception?

Santa of course, the other two don't actually exist!

Santa Claus Takes Poor, Sick Rudolph to the Vet

He says to the vet, 'Doctor, please do something for my Rudolph. His nose won't 
light up.

The vet walks out of the room and returns with a pet carrier. He places the pet 
carrier next to the reindeer, opens it and out steps a cat. The cat walks around
 the reindeer and sniffs it. The cat then climbs back into the carrier. The vet 
takes it out of the room and returns. He hands Santa Claus the bill.

Santa gasps, ?350 euro! You didn't do anything for my Rudolph and you're charging
me ?350 euro.

The vet shrugged and replied, 'That's the usual charge. ?50 euro for the office 
visit and ?300 euro for the CAT SCAN.'

A bitterly cold story to bring you a big warm smile Steve

How They Forecast a Bitterly Cold Winter

One day in early September the chief of a Native American tribe was asked by his
 tribal elders if the winter of 2014/15 was going to be cold or mild.  The chief
 asked his medicine man, but he too had lost touch with the reading signs from the
natural world around the Great Lakes.

In truth, neither of them had a clue about how to predict the coming winter.  However,
the chief decided to take a modern approach, so the chief rang the National Weather
Service in Gaylord Michigan.

'Yes, it is going to be a cold winter,' the meteorological officer told the chief.
 Consequently, he went back to his tribe and told the men to collect plenty of firewood.

A fortnight later the chief called the Weather Service and asked for an update. 
'Are you still forecasting a cold winter?' he asked.

'Yes, very cold', the weather officer told him.

As a result of this brief conversation the chief went back to the tribe and told
 his people to collect every bit of wood they could find.

A month later the chief called the National Weather Service once more and asked 
about the coming winter. 'Yes,' he was told, 'it is going to be one of the coldest
winters ever.'

'How can you be so sure?' the chief asked.

The weatherman replied: 'Because the Native Americans of the Great Lakes are collecting
wood like crazy.'

A useful fable to remember as we look forward to good times in the new year 2015

In their book "Who Are you? What do you want?" (Penguin group) authors, Mick Ukleja
and Robert Lorber offer this fable by George Reavis as the perfect example of why
you should always stick to what you are good at:

The animals developed a school that included swimming, flying, running and climbing.
It was decided that all the animals would be required to take and pass every subject.

Naturally, the duck was the best swimmer in the school. Unfortunately, he wasn't
 so great at running. In order to improve his running, the duck had to stop swimming
and spend his free time practicing sprints. Eventually, he injured his feet and 
was no longer good at swimming.

The rabbit had the opposite problem. He was a great runner, but he couldn't swim
 to save his life. This failure caused him to go crazy.

The squirrel was hands down the greatest climber of any of the animals. And he loved
soaring down to the ground from the tree branches.

But when he was required to fly from the ground up, he pulled a muscle in his side
that prevented him from climbing and running. His grades suffered all around.

Then there was the eagle who liked nothing better than soaring through the air. 
But he insisted on doing things on his own terms, and so he was expelled for being
a nonconformist.

It's OK to have dreams and goals that challenge us to improve ourselves. However,
when you don't know your limitations, you'll likely waste valuable time and energy
striving for unrealistic goals.

With this example Ukjela and Lorber remind us to remember that when things start
 picking up and you or your company are looking ahead down the road to expansion
 and development you shouldn't forget to draw upon the strengths, talents and abilities
that you have already.

This Christmas 100 years ago...

The year 1914 saw the Christmas spirit manifest itself in the most unlikely of places-a
World War I battlefield. Starting on the evening of December 24, scores of German,
British and French troops in Belgium laid down their arms and initiated a spontaneous
holiday ceasefire.

The truce was reportedly instigated by the Germans, who decorated their trenches
 with Christmas trees and candles and began singing carols like "Silent Night." 
British troops responded with their own rendition of "The First Noel," and the weary
combatants eventually ventured into "no man's land"-the treacherous, bombed-out 
space that separated the trenches-to greet one another and shake hands.

According to accounts from the men involved, the soldiers shared cigarettes and 
pulls of whiskey, and some exchanged Christmas presents with men they had been shooting
at only hours before.

Taking advantage of the brief lull in combat, some Scottish, English and German 
troops even played a pick-up game of soccer on the frozen battlefield. The truce
 was not sanctioned by the officers on either side, and eventually the men were 
called back to their respective trenches to resume fighting.

Later attempts at holiday meetings were mostly forbidden, but as the war dragged
 on the "Christmas Truce" would stand as a remarkable example of shared humanity
 and brotherhood on the battlefield.

It happened at Christmastime!

A lovely Irish Christmas Story

Sebastian Barry

In search of the last turkey in Ireland

by Sebastian Barry

Here we are in the 1960s, old Victorian terrace house facing the storming sea, the
crackle of December greys and changing browns and touches of pitch moving across
 the water. The seaside hotel across the road stands all its feet in darkest shadows,
a startling ghost in every room. Even my grandfather, who is a painter, couldn't
 capture this violently altering scene. I am about 11, standing at an upstairs window.
There is snow all along the top of the granite wall that fringes our terrace, very
very white and burning but for all that like the crust of an endless loaf. The glass
gives me back a version of my face, the eyes floating in a ruined whiteness.

I can see trouble below. My father is just arriving back from town but he is stopping
the white Volkswagen in the middle of the road, not pulling into the curb. He gets
out ' and falls towards the pavement, a splash of sudden green ink on the snow, 
in his green coat. Then rises more or less to his knees and starts the tricky climb
up the stone steps, vanishing from sight under the canopy of the front door.

An all-time favorite at Christmastime

Twas The Night Before Christmas

Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,

While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow

Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.

Christmas simply would not be Christmas without reading this

wonderful poem aloud to yourself or - better still - reading it to a child.

Psssssssst! Any idea where the 'X' in Xmas comes from?
Did You Know?
While some have objected to using the term "Xmas" as an abbreviation for "Christmas," this particular form of shorthand has been around for hundreds of years.
In fact, the "X" in "Xmas" is actually the symbol for "Chi"-the first letter in the Greek spelling of the word "Christos," or Christ. Use of the letter "X" as an abbreviation for Christ's name is over 1,000 years old, and the term "Xmas" has been used in English as far back as the 18th century.

Q.
What kind of motorbike does Santa ride?
A.
A Holly Davidson, of course!
Where's Santa?
Oooooooops!
Knock Knock!
Who's there?
Rabbit.
Rabbit who?
Rabbit up carefully,  it's a present!
I believe in Santa
Just before Xmas, an honest politician, a generous boss and 		Santa Claus all got into the lift (elevator) at the Ritz Hotel in London.  		As the lift travelled from the 5th floor down to the ground level, 		one-by-one they noticed a £50 note lying on the lift's floor.
Which one picked up the £50 note, and handed it in at reception?
Santa of course, the other two don't actually exist!
Santa Claus Takes Poor, Sick Rudolph to the Vet
He says to the vet, 'Doctor, please do something for my Rudolph. His nose won't light up.
The vet walks out of the room and returns with a pet carrier. He places the pet carrier next to the reindeer, opens it and out steps a cat. The cat walks around the reindeer and sniffs it. The cat then climbs back into the carrier. The vet takes it out of the room and returns. He hands Santa Claus the bill.
Santa gasps, €350 euro! You didn't do anything for my Rudolph and you're charging me €350 euro.
The vet shrugged and replied, 'That's the usual charge. €50 euro for the office visit and €300 euro for the CAT SCAN.'

A bitterly cold story to bring you a big warm smile Steve
How They Forecast a Bitterly Cold Winter
One day in early September the chief of a Native American tribe was asked by his tribal elders if the winter of 2014/15 was going to be cold or mild.  The chief asked his medicine man, but he too had lost touch with the reading signs from the natural world around the Great Lakes.
In truth, neither of them had a clue about how to predict the coming winter.  However, the chief decided to take a modern approach, so the chief rang the National Weather Service in Gaylord Michigan.
'Yes, it is going to be a cold winter,' the meteorological officer told the chief.  Consequently, he went back to his tribe and told the men to collect plenty of firewood.
A fortnight later the chief called the Weather Service and asked for an update. 'Are you still forecasting a cold winter?' he asked.
'Yes, very cold', the weather officer told him.
As a result of this brief conversation the chief went back to the tribe and told his people to collect every bit of wood they could find.
A month later the chief called the National Weather Service once more and asked about the coming winter. 'Yes,' he was told, 'it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever.'
'How can you be so sure?' the chief asked.
The weatherman replied: 'Because the Native Americans of the Great Lakes are collecting wood like crazy.'

A useful fable to remember as we look forward to good times in the new year 2015
In their book
"Who Are you? What do you want?"
(Penguin group) authors, Mick Ukleja and Robert Lorber offer this fable by George Reavis as the perfect example of why you should always stick to what you are good at:
The animals developed a school that included swimming, flying, running and climbing. It was decided that all the animals would be required to take and pass every subject.
Naturally, the duck was the best swimmer in the school. Unfortunately, he wasn't so great at running. In order to improve his running, the duck had to stop swimming and spend his free time practicing sprints. Eventually, he injured his feet and was no longer good at swimming.
The rabbit had the opposite problem. He was a great runner, but he couldn't swim to save his life. This failure caused him to go crazy.
The squirrel was hands down the greatest climber of any of the animals. And he loved soaring down to the ground from the tree branches.
But when he was required to fly from the ground up, he pulled a muscle in his side that prevented him from climbing and running. His grades suffered all around.
Then there was the eagle who liked nothing better than soaring through the air. But he insisted on doing things on his own terms, and so he was expelled for being a nonconformist.
It's OK to have dreams and goals that challenge us to improve ourselves. However, when you don't know your limitations, you'll likely waste valuable time and energy striving for unrealistic goals.
With this example Ukjela and Lorber remind us to remember that when things start picking up and you or your company are looking ahead down the road to expansion and development you shouldn't forget to draw upon the strengths, talents and abilities that you have already.
This Christmas 100 years ago...
The year 1914 saw the Christmas spirit manifest itself in the most unlikely of places-a World War I battlefield. Starting on the evening of December 24, scores of German, British and French troops in Belgium laid down their arms and initiated a spontaneous holiday ceasefire.
The truce was reportedly instigated by the Germans, who decorated their trenches with Christmas trees and candles and began singing carols like "Silent Night." British troops responded with their own rendition of "The First Noel," and the weary combatants eventually ventured into "no man's land"-the treacherous, bombed-out space that separated the trenches-to greet one another and shake hands.
According to accounts from the men involved, the soldiers shared cigarettes and pulls of whiskey, and some exchanged Christmas presents with men they had been shooting at only hours before.
Taking advantage of the brief lull in combat, some Scottish, English and German troops even played a pick-up game of soccer on the frozen battlefield. The truce was not sanctioned by the officers on either side, and eventually the men were called back to their respective trenches to resume fighting.
Later attempts at holiday meetings were mostly forbidden, but as the war dragged on the "Christmas Truce" would stand as a remarkable example of shared humanity and brotherhood on the battlefield.
It happened at Christmastime!

A lovely Irish Christmas Story
Sebastian Barry
In search of the last turkey in Ireland
by Sebastian Barry
Here we are in the 1960s, old Victorian terrace house facing the storming sea, the crackle of December greys and changing browns and touches of pitch moving across the water. The seaside hotel across the road stands all its feet in darkest shadows, a startling ghost in every room. Even my grandfather, who is a painter, couldn't capture this violently altering scene. I am about 11, standing at an upstairs window. There is snow all along the top of the granite wall that fringes our terrace, very very white and burning but for all that like the crust of an endless loaf. The glass gives me back a version of my face, the eyes floating in a ruined whiteness.
I can see trouble below. My father is just arriving back from town but he is stopping the white Volkswagen in the middle of the road, not pulling into the curb. He gets out ' and falls towards the pavement, a splash of sudden green ink on the snow, in his green coat. Then rises more or less to his knees and starts the tricky climb up the stone steps, vanishing from sight under the canopy of the front door.

An all-time favorite at Christmastime
Twas The Night Before Christmas
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.
Christmas simply would not be Christmas without reading this
wonderful poem aloud to yourself or - better still - reading it to a child.
