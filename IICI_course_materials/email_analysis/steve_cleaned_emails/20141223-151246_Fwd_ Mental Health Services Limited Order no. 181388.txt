Dear, Delphine!

What a great news! I have signed the paper (see the attached file) and
tomorrow will be on the way to you via DHL.

So my company is: Mental Health Services Limited
With address: Nova Business Center, 9/F
                     Henan Building 19 Luard Road
                     Wanchai
                     Hong Kong

Correct?




Best regards,

Rozalia
