Fewer hiding places for expats tax evaders
The Telegraph reports that expat tax dodgers are running out of places to hide, as information about their bank accounts and assets will soon be exchanged between 93 governments globally. At present, if tax authorities suspect people of tax evasion and want details about their finances, they have to request these of overseas banks and other institutions. But within two years, tax authorities will automatically exchange information on everyone, every year, regardless of whether they’ve been paying their taxes or not. Adam Thompson, tax manager at the Fry Group, said: “For those expats who have not been wholly transparent in their dealings with their local tax authority this will be a big change and if they have not disclosed something, they may have a problem. If expats do have unreported assets or income, then now is a good time to disclose it before the automatic regime starts from 2017.” Jason Porter, director at Blevins Franks, adds: “Automatic exchange of information should hold no fear for the fully transparent taxpayer but the serial tax evader should be concerned.”

Families worse off under Tories by £1,100 a year on average, claims Balls
Ed Balls has claimed that households are worse off to the tune of £1,100 a year as a result in the rise in VAT and cuts to tax credits. He has released a new poster with the figure of £1,100 superimposed over the black door of the chancellor’s official Downing Street residence. The poster says: “£1,100. The cost of a Tory chancellor.” Figures from the IFS show that a couple who are both working and on average earnings, with two children, will be £1,700 worse off in 2015-16. A lone parent with two children working 25 hours a week on the minimum wage will be £1,800 worse off in 2015-16.

Easter savings
The Times carries a guide to the new tax allowances that are available from Easter Monday. The amount people can earn before paying tax will rise from £10,000 to £10,600 – as a result most people paying the 20% tax rate will be better off by £132 over the next year. There are also perks for married couples, a boost for Isas, less tax on savings and changes to Junior Isas or child trust funds. Simon Read in the Independent also looks ahead to the new tax year and explains the new rules and regulations. Jane Moore, tax manager at the ICAEW, comments: “As usual, we are seeing a plethora of tax changes with the start of the new tax year and a lot of people will be affected.” She adds that whether it is pensions or savings tax, people need to be aware of the changes and what they mean for them individually.

Brown attacks SNP over social justice
Writing in the Scotsman, Gordon Brown has said that “independence matters more” to the SNP than social justice. He warned that the Nationalists would not use more powers for Holyrood to pursue equality. The former Labour leader's attack on the SNP came after he produced Treasury papers which he said showed the SNP was signed up to zero spending for the next year, which would lead to more austerity. Mr Brown added: “The SNP, is seeing its 'tax and spending' arithmetic unravelling - unable to answer basic questions about their two biggest policies: how they will end austerity and deliver social justice.”

Results of cutting corporation tax

Deep learning systems threaten industry
John Straw, co-author of iDisrupted, writes in the Economist that accountants and lawyers face a growing challenge from algorithms used in “deep learning”. He says much of the revenue for professional services comes from the high volume of discovery work carried out by juniors. He subsequently adds that discovery work is the primary job of deep learning, which then leads to pattern recognition and thus replaces work carried out by accountants and lawyers. He notes that Nvidia has recently launched a dedicated deep-learning computer, DIGITS, which cost only $15,000.

More questions than answers at Quindell
The FT’s Alphaville column looks at the ongoing problems at Quindell, which this week revealed that it had omitted to mention that the sale of its business to Slater & Gordon included two of its technology units. The omission meant the deal was less advantageous to Quindell than first thought. The FT states that a restatement cannot come soon enough.

PENSIONS

Free pensions guidance being underused
Experts have warned that a free guidance service for savers is being underused ahead of new reforms that give people more access to their money. Providers are expecting a sharp rise in requests to cash in pensions after the reforms come into force next week, but bookings for the Pension Wise guidance service, which opened nearly two weeks ago, were not at capacity. Malcolm McLean of Barnett Waddingham, said: “People are looking for information and it is a pity that they are not turning to Pension Wise, an impartial source.” Ros Altmann, the government's older workers business champion, added: “We need a campaign to promote the booking line for Pension Wise.”

Final salary cash up 15%
The lump sum savers are being offered by their employers if they choose to swap their final salary benefits for cash are approaching their most generous level for a year, according to data from Xafinity. At the end of March the average final salary scheme would swap benefits of £10,000 a year, to be paid to a 65-year-old, for a lump sum worth £213,000. This is up by 15% on March 2014, when a £10,000 a year final salary pension could be swapped for £185,000.

SMEs

Shared parenting rules come into force
From Sunday, new shared parenting rules will come into force, which will see parents who both work entitled to take up to almost half a year off after having a baby or adopting. The compulsory two weeks maternity leave for mothers will remain, as will the two weeks paternity leave for fathers, but the remaining maternity leave can now be shared or transferred to the father. While the change has won praise from family groups, concerns have been raised about the possible impact on Britain’s SMEs. Irwin Mitchell’s Chris Tutton said many businesses are simply unprepared for the “sea-change” in working patterns that the legislation represents. A survey by the Bristol-based company HR Dept found that barely half of the nearly 400 businesses that it polled understood the new legislation.

ECONOMY

High street sales hit
Results of the BDO High Street Sales Tracker show that high street sales have this month seen their biggest monthly decline in three years. Like-for-like sales were down 4% on the back of falling footfall and discounting. The figure represents the largest dip since September 2011. Fashion saw the steepest fall, with sales down 5.5%, while homeware was the best performer, with a 6.5% increase in sales. Sophie Bevan, head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said: “We know consumers have money to spend, but these figures show they won't commit unless they feel the product and the price is right.”

Double standards?
The Mail investigates Martin Freeman in the light of his appearance in a Labour party political broadcast last week, where he said Labour was the only choice for right-minded voters as it starts from the right place: “community, compassion and decency”. The Mail alleges that Mr Freeman is a tax avoider and instead of using his own wealth to settle his wife’s £120,000 tax bill allowed her to be declared bankrupt. The paper also argues that Mr Freeman is one of the “privileged few” he condemns. Pointing to his children’s private education as an example.
