To Form a UK LLP we need 2 directors and there are no shareholders.

 

Also they need to purchase Registered Address service. UK LLP can not be
formed with registered address in Spain.

 

Also we will need proof of address of 2nd director Viktor.

 

Provide me with above information and I will place the order.

 

Thank you
