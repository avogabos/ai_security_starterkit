the service is expired since 28-September-2016.
Note
that official mails from government bodies are sent at company’s Registered
Address and due to expired service any official mail coming on to Registered
Address will be sent back to sender, company can miss an important mail which
may cause company to strike-off or financial penalties. In any case we will not
be responsible because service is expired.
To
avoid any misfortune we advice to renew the Registered Address service as soon
as possible. OR if you do not wish to renew then please change company’s
registered address as soon as possible.
