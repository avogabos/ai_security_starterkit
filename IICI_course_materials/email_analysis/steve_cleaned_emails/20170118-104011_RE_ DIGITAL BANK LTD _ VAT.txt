Ok,

Well I suggest that they file a more generic SIC code first, and then apply
for vat stating they are providing design services to Europe etc, and
selling stock images etc and prinatbles/ consumables . then vat should be
approved, and then can refile sic as what they want.

 

The vat application should be fine if they have a uk trading address and uk
director

Will need the NI number too for the director
