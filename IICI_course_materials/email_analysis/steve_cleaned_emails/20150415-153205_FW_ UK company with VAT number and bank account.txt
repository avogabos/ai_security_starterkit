Hi Oliver

As I said to you on the phone, the only registration agent contacted was FORMATIONS HOUSE.

I received NO REPLY from Formations House. I would however, like to receive your reply!

I have NOTHING IN SPAM.

I think you should ensure that you're not being hacked!!!

Regards.

Djuri.

Hi Oliver

Re our phone conversation. This is my original message which was sent to info@formationshouse.com.

How was it received by another firm?

Are your emails being intercepted?

The reply was received from Jason Woods - info@companyformationregistration.com !!

Strange?

Hi

I see on your website you have companies with VAT/bank account.

I live in France.

Can I take over a company under these circumstances?

Regards.

Djuri.
