Dear Dr Bashir M Sani,

 

Unfortunately the company name Every Drop Foundation Inc. will not be
approved as the word "Foundation" is stated on the Registry's List of
Restricted Words. Kindly provide us with an alternative company name so that
we may forward same to the Registry for their further consideration.  

 

 

Thank you.

 

Delphine
