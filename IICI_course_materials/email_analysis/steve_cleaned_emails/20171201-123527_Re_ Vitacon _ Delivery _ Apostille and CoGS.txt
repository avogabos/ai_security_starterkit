Re: Vitacon
Dear Steve Smith,
Hope this email finds you well.
I am very disappointed with this fact.
According to the General Regulations of Universal Postal
            Union the parcel
            should be retained at the post office 30 calendar days. I am
            sure if your
            company would have provide me the tracking number on time as
            I asked this would
            not have happened.
I will appreciate if you could notify me in  timeley manner 
            via
            email as soon as the parcel will be delivered to your
            office.
