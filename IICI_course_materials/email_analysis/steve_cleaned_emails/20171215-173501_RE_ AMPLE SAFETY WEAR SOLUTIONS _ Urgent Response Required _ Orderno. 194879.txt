Dear Steve 

 

 

As for turnover I give the same response I gave the VAT registration
request.  Who knows this is a start-up business and it may go well and may
go bad. But we hope to do 20,000 a year after the first year, and the
industry is supplying safety gloves and Clothing to the building and
construction trade as per the CE 388 4124 standards. Our SIC 32990 sub code
047

 

Hope this answers your questions

 

Kind regards

 

Terence
