Dear Steve,

It is good to hear that you found a native Russian who could check the 
documents.
Thank you very much for your kind cooperation!

In addition kindly note that the UB does not contain an apartment number 
because mrs. Bratushenko lives in a private house, therefore "48" it is 
the number of the house.

Regarding the SIC codes please indicate the following:

46190
52241
52242
52243

In case of questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Victoria Becker

Dear
Victoria
            Becker
Attach
            is
            amended invoice.
KYC
            documents:
-
            Proof of
            id \u2013 passport is acceptable.
-
            Proof of
            residential address is not acceptable, because:
1.
            It must
            be in English. If document is not in English then along with
            original you need
            to submit NOTARIZED English translation of the document.
2.
We
            have the document checked by a native Russian who said that
            \u201cPassport is
            fine but the proof of address does not show the apartment
            number or the town\u201d.
            Therefore you need to provide a document where we can verify
            Director\u2019s name, and
            complete address. We would prefer if you can provide latest
            credit card
            statement or bank statement where issue date, name, address
            and account number
            must be visible.
For
SIC
            code, you can only submit 4 SIC codes at one time, therefore
            please choose
            4 SIC codes from your given list and inform us.
Waiting
for
            your reply.
Regards,
Steve\u2026

Dear
                    Steve,
Following
                  to our phone
                  conversation of yesterday, I kindly request the
                  following:
1. Please, confirm the receipt of KYC
                for Ms. Bratushenko -
                director, shareholder and person with the signicant
                control
2. I kindly ask you to revise the
              invoice as you forgot to
              add 65 pounds as express mail courier fee for the next
              company, which I will
              submit for formation in the nearest future. In this
              respect, please,
              recalculate the total amount (it should be 630 pounds) in
              USD and EURO as per
              applicable converstion rate.
3. Last but
            not least, while
            submitting the application for Vitacon formation, I have
            wrongfully specified
            some SIC codes. I kindly ask you to make some updates in
            this regard on your
            side before submitting the application to Company's House.
            The correct SIC
            codes for Vitacon Ltd are listed below:
46170
46190
46390
52241
52242
52243
53100
53202
Your early reply will be highly appreciated,
Best regards,
Victoria Becker

As per latest invoice sent by you in  total amount of

Looking forward hearing from you.
