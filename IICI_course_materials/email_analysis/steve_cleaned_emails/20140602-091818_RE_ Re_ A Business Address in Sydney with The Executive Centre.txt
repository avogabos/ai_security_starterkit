Hi Steve,



Thank you for your email and I hope you have had a nice weekend,



Following your request for pricing at Northpoint Tower, for 6 months I can
offer the Business Address Plan for $76.00 or for 12 months $68.00. If you
would like to pay in full and upfront then I can offer a further 5%
discount.



There are two ways that you can pay for the Virtual office, either via card
payment or via Fund Transfer. If you wanted to pay by card we would require
1 month deposit (we do not charge any card fees) If you wanted to pay via
Fund Transfer then we would require two months deposit.



Please let me know which method is best suited for you and if you want to
go for 6 or 12 months, and also I would require the following information
below. Once I have all of this information I can then get the licence
agreement drawn up for you.



·         Full Company Name & Current Address

·         ABN number

·         Main Contact (If different to yourself)

·         Accounts department Contact name and email (if different to
yourself)

·         The Date you would like to start



Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me,



Kind Regards,



Daniel Noble
