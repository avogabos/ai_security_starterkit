To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Dear Steve,

I would like to mention that my email address has been changed as hale@evtiko.com <mailto:hale@evtiko.com> instead of hale@afrag3.com <mailto:hale@afrag3.com> 

Ref: Company Number: 09490723

First of all we need to get the authentication code to access WebFiling and submit data on Companies House, I have already applied for the code few days ago. As you may have already know that the company authentication code is sent by post to the company's registered office address, normally sent within 5 working days but I regretly tell that we are not receiving any kind of documents, letters or anyting from our current registered office address as "85 Great Portland Street, London, England, W1W 7LT" for Global Three Limited. (Meanwhlie could you please explaine the reason for RO Address changing without our request?)


Please find the attached AA02 Form that we have filled up, accounts made as Dormant company, signed version of this form is already delivered to the Companies House Office directly on Friday, 30th of December, please see the address below;




Companies House 
4 Abbey Ochard Street
Westminister
LONDON
SW1P 2HT

Our company status is active hovewer their systems have not yet been processed about accounts filing as you can check from their web site; it shows "Accounts overdue" sign at the moment. 
https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09490723 <https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09490723> 

We will need your advice to make sure that account filing is done by delivering legal documents to their office before end of last year. 

We will also need your helps to renew some products which ones is necessary. So could you please kindly make a statement for us to prepare the payment. 

Many thanks for all your helps,
Best Regards,
Hale
