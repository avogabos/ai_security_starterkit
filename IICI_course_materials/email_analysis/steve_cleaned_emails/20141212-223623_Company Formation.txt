Hi Steve,
Thank you for providing details about company formation and admin. I'm not
sure if I get it right. Did you mean it will cost GBP100 for company
formation and the first year admin. Then GBP400 per annum including
registered address and value accounting. And if we order these services,
does that mean we only need to focus on our business and have no worries
about company account, tax return or sort of.
Thanks for your time and help. Have a nice weekend.
