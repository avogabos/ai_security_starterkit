Dear Branislav Jergovic
 
 
Sorry for all the delays.
 
 
We have been having problems with Gambia bank, they are not responding us in timely manners. For this reason we are looking into  other banks in different regions.
 
For time being bank account and merchant account opening services have been suspended. The specification that I prepared for you, is of no use now.
 
I you wish to cancel your order and change the order to company formation only, please let me know, I will update the order.
 
 
Regards
 
Steve
