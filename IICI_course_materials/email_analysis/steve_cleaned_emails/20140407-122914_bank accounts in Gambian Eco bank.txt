Subject: bank accounts in Gambian Eco bank
From: Andrei Grishko <a.grishko@globuex.com>
To: "Steve Smith (Formations House)" <steve@formationshouse.com>

Dear Steve,

I hope that this email finds you well. Our clients who incorporated two 
companies in Gambia, i.e. Big Crown Limited and New Imperial Limited in 
2013, also ordered the service of corporate account opening in Gambian 
Eco Bank. However, as we understand your negotiations with the bank have 
not lead to positive outcome. Thus, they request to return money paid 
for incorporation of these two companies and bank accounts opening. 
Therefore, I would like to know your view of this situation before 
addressing their requests. What can be done from your end in order to 
settle this situation amicably?

Best regards,
Andrei
