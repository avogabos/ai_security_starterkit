Then he wants you to file share issues, 

 

He should do this himself via the online admin.

 

He would first need to ensure the company has been capitalised (no of shares
* value of each share) to reflect the amount being sold

If its not capitalised enough he will need to do share issue.

Then he should transfer the shares to the new investor (person or company)
and mark as fully paid up.

 

We wouldnt usually do this for the customer, he should do this himself in
online admin

Query from customer

 

 

What we need is the initial starting balance of Balios Finance.

This balance must show the deposit of shares Von Leuchtenberg Finance (also
owned by Mr. HW Hermann) for an amount of £ 5,250,000.

Then in the balance it must appear that the capital of the company Balios
Finance was fully paid.
