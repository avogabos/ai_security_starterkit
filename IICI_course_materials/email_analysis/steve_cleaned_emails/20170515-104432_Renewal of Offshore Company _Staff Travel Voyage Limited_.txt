Hi
Steve
Is all
complete re below now so that I can make amends to the shareholders/directors
per your previous?:
Once above services are renewed then
you can login to your account and use online company administrator to generate
resolutions for appointment of new director and shareholder. You need to
download these resolutions, print, sign and send it to us by email, which then
will be forwarded to Seychelles registry for processing.

FYI
Steve, the new shareholder will be in the form of a BVI company, can you advise
what info you require for this?
