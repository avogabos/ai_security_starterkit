Dear Steve Smith
Thank you for the quick response. I got all answers of my questions.
Today I was in my bank but I could not pay the invoice - do it in euros or US dollars, and I'll pay tomorrow.
Your company provides international legal services? We need legal support our contracts with British partners.
P.S. If you do not specialize in lawyers and legal services, please recommend to anyone we can talk about it.
Kind regards

RE: RE: For Virtual adress
Dear Vladyslav Teliuk
Following are the answers to your queries:
1.
Postal address will be a ‘Harley Street, London’ address. It will be a physical address and PO Box.
2.
A London phone number will be assigned for you. Our phone operators will take calls for you from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday. They will only take message and those will be forwarded to you by email.
For calls after 5pm and weekends you can set it for automated answering and voice message service.
3.
Email Account creation service is not included in Virtual Office services.
If you need to have a domain with email addresses the cost will be 60 GBP per annum.
Please note, we have checked and found that domain ‘heptagon.со.uk’ is not available for registration.
Regards
Steve

Dear Steve Smith
Thank you for the quick response.
I have a few questions for Virtual Office:
1. We will have a postal address (and box) in London?
2. We will have your phone number in London and the Secretary will be taking calls or answering machine? From 9 am to 18 pm or not?
3. We will have your e-mail in the format "hello@heptagon.со.uk"?
Kind regards
