Dear Eric

 

I am very sorry, initially I was told that company could be registered
as:

 

-
BANKDARKAR (no space – all one word)

- DARKARBANK
(no space – all one word)

 

However now registry has rejected above names and again for the
same reason which is the word BANK.

 

It will cost you GBP 5000 to use the word BANK in company name
if you wish to proceed or you can completely change company name by removing the
word BANK.

 

Once again I am very sorry for trouble that you are facing due
the issue. I am waiting for your reply to advice on how you wish to proceed.

 

With sincere apologies, thank you for understanding and
co-operation.

 

Regards

 

Steve..

Please go ahead and use Torry 5, 863 Granges-Paccot as my
private address.





Secondly I was very pleased to think that Gambia would Bank
in a company name and what you told me was a bad surprise. But nevermind let us
go ahead with DakarBank Ltd for now. 





Best regards.

Dear Eric

 

 

Thank you for sending documents for due
diligence.

 

 

On the application you have mentioned
address as:

 

Lausanne 33

Fribourg

Switzerland

1701

 

And the documents provided by you (bank
statement) shows the address as:

 

Chemio de Torry 5

Granges-Paccot

Switzerland

1763

 

Please confirm that we can use the
address as mentioned on the documents provided.

 

 

COMPANY NAME:

 

Please note that company name BANK OF
DAKAR has been rejected by Gambia Registry because the work ‘BANK’ is sensitive
and requires special fee to use the word ‘BANK’ in company name. The fee to use
the sensitive word in company name is GBP 5000.

 

Or you can choose one of the alternate
company name to avoid sensitive word issue:

 

- BANKDARKAR (no space – all one word)

- DARKARBANK (no space – all one word)

 

 

Please provide us with required
information as mentioned above so that we can further proceed with your
application.

 

 

Regards

 

Steve…
