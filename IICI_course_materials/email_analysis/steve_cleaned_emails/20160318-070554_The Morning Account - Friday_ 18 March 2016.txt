“Misguided” tax cuts questioned

The Chancellor's latest tax cuts for the wealthy mean he will have to reduce borrowing by £32bn to meet his budget surplus rule in 2019-20, according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank said the decision to offer tax cuts to wealthier groups in the form of higher tax thresholds and lower CGT was “misguided” when official forecasts suggest there is a £56bn gap in the government’s finances. The foundation's analysis of the tax and benefit changes for the rest of the parliament shows that by 2020 the poorest fifth of households will lose an average of £550, while the richest fifth will gain an average £250. The Institute for Fiscal Studies also criticised Budget giveaways which it said favoured “the better off”, citing the decision to increase the personal allowance. And the IFS warned that growth in wages and living standards is set to slow, after George Osborne revised down forecasts for economic expansion. "This will lead to lower wages and living standards, not just lower tax revenues for the Treasury," it said.

HMRC errors prevent couples taking up marriage tax break

An official report says millions of couples have missed out on the Conservatives’ flagship marriage tax break because of computer problems at HMRC and a lack of publicity. Although more than 4.2m people are eligible for the £212-a-year perk, just 504,000 have taken it up, the Office for Budget Responsibility found. The watchdog blamed IT chaos at HMRC for hindering applicants and said the scheme had been poorly advertised, stating: "Take up for this measure has been much lower than initially assumed. Lower take-up is likely to reflect issues with HMRC's IT systems, a lack of awareness about the allowance and possibly a reluctance by those eligible to engage."

Sturgeon: Higher rate tax cut is ‘wrong choice’

Nicola Sturgeon has said that raising the starting point at which Scottish workers’ pay the 40p tax rate was the “wrong choice”. Speaking after George Osborne’s Budget, she was pressed on whether the SNP would implement his plan if it was elected to the Scottish government for a third time on May 5th. She said: “The Scottish government will set out our detailed income tax proposals early next week. These will be based on our judgement for what is right for Scotland now and in the long term. But let me be absolutely clear today - a large tax cut for 10% of the population, those on the highest incomes, at a time when support for the disabled is being cut, at a time when our public services are under pressure, is in my view the wrong choice.”

Budget offers little to ease housing crisis

The Times’ Bricks and Mortar supplement outlines how the extension of the 3% buy-to-let stamp duty levy to investors with more than 15 properties could affect the private rental sector. David Ramsdale, residential research analyst at Cushman & Wakefield, said changes to property taxation could jeopardise the supply of private rental homes, placing greater pressure on rental values. The Times’ Anne Ashworth suggests that the latest measures unfairly penalise landlords and will do nothing to alleviate the housing crisis, a view echoed by Isabelle Fraser in the Telegraph. Property bosses have also suggested that increasing the rate of tax paid on commercial property transactions could hit investment in the sector and cause a slowdown in regional development. Separately, the Times notes that people will be able to earn £1,000 tax-free in future when renting out their home - or a room in their home - through platforms such as Airbnb.

Osborne strikes balance with corporation tax cuts in Budget

Business groups have welcomed George Osborne’s decision to cut corporation tax to just 17%, but the UK still remains behind Ireland in a KPMG-compiled table of multinationals’ favourite tax regimes in Europe. The Standard’s Jim Armitage notes that although the 17% rate hands £1bn back to businesses when it arrives in 2017, the Chancellor is increasing the overall tax take by at least £10bn in the coming five years by ditching swathes of tax reliefs.

Business rates cuts questioned

Economists have questioned whether small companies will actually benefit from cuts to business rates. George Osborne announced that 600,000 small companies would be exempt from the levy, starting next April, while a further 250,000 would pay reduced rates. But Helen Miller, an associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: "In the short run, the changes are likely to benefit people who rent property, because they have rent contracts, and you cannot increase rents overnight. But in the long run, we can expect a lot of that 'change' to be capitalised into the value of the underlying properties."

The Daily Telegraph, Business, Page: 5

 

Private equity critical of CGT decision

Private equity managers have criticised the "illogical" decision to exclude them from sweeping CGT cuts announced in the Budget, as the industry braces itself for a broader crackdown on tax loopholes. It comes after George Osborne specifically shut out carried interest - the cut of profits that fund managers get to keep - from new lower rates of CGT.

The Daily Telegraph, Business, Page: 5

 

Osborne’s tax plans pose economic threat

The Telegraph’s Allister Heath warns that George Osborne’s plans to raise taxes could ultimately hit the economy. He argues that Britain needs a lower tax burden, not a higher one, and says the composition of the higher taxes set out in this week’s Budget is likely to be especially damaging to growth and incentives. Elsewhere, the Guardian’s Larry Elliott says Mr Osborne could only make his sums add up by deploying “some pretty blatant accounting tricks.”

The Daily Telegraph, Business, Page: 2   The Guardian, Page: 6, 7

 

“Tampon tax” set to be scrapped

Britain is about to secure a deal with the European Commission allowing it to scrap the so-called "tampon tax", the government has said. VAT is currently charged at 5% on sanitary products, the lowest rate allowable under EU law. Chancellor George Osborne said he hoped to announce it would be scrapped altogether "in the next few days".

The Independent, Page: 10   The Times, Page: 8, 9   Daily Mail, Page: 7

 

Budget unfair, say voters

A YouGov poll for The Times shows 38% of voters thought George Osborne's Budget was unfair, compared with 28% who thought it was fair. Just over half, 51%, think the government is handling the economy badly.

INDUSTRY

 

Financial fraud rising

A report from Financial Fraud Action UK has revealed that fraudsters managed to steal £755m from British consumers and financial institutions during 2015 – a 26% increase on the year before. The report found that the biggest growth area was remote banking fraud with over £168m stolen from unsuspecting consumers. Internet banking fraud rose 64% to £133m during 2015, while losses due to telephone banking fraud rose 92% to £32.3m.

PENSIONS

 

Lifetime Isa won’t solve pension problems

Writing in the Telegraph, John McTernan suggests that the newly announced Lifetime Isa will do little to address workers' concerns about pensions and housing affordability. He argues that housing remains a supply issue, while the problem with using the Isa as a “pension substitute” is that it encourages savers to opt out of a company pension and give up on employers’ contributions. Elsewhere, the FT reports that pension industry experts have described the Lifetime Isa as a “backdoor” change to the UK pensions system.

New 'Tech City Tax' may stymie start-ups' growth 

New measures introduced in the Budget mean that any employee receiving shares from March 17th will be allowed to make a tax-free gain of just £100,000 in their lifetime. Any gain above that level will be taxed at normal capital gains tax rates, which have been cut from 28% to 20%. Some tax experts have said the new measure could stymie start-ups' growth. “Large gains are normally found in successful tech start-ups where the value of the company can shoot up rapidly, so this could be seen as a Tech City Tax . . . This could deter companies from motivating their staff and, in turn, hit their rate of growth " said Cormac Marum of Harwood Hutton.

Evening Standard, Page: 60

 

Confidence falls

The FSB says confidence among small firms has dropped "significantly" and is at its lowest level for three years. The slump is most noticeable in London and the east of England, with uncertainty over the UK and global economy blamed for the fall in confidence. Small business owners throughout Scotland were also among the gloomiest in the UK, with a majority expecting conditions to deteriorate in the coming months.

Mortgage lending dips in February 

New figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that lending to homebuyers reached £17.6bn in February, a 5% decline on January's £18.5bn but an increase of 29% on the £13.6bn recorded a year ago. The CML figures show the highest lending total for a February since 2008 when gross lending reached £24.1bn. Experts say loans have been fuelled by a “rush to buy” ahead of changes to stamp duty on second homes in April.

ECONOMY

 

Bank wary of Brexit effect on pound

The Bank of England says uncertainty in the run-up to the June referendum on EU membership has hit sterling, and that UK economic growth could slow. The Bank said that uncertainty about the vote could delay spending decisions and act as a drag on demand. Sterling has fallen as a direct result of the Brexit debate, it added. Meanwhile, UK interest rates have been held at 0.5% once again by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.

The Daily Telegraph    The Times 

 

Household debt set to increase

Official forecasts indicate that weak pay growth and low interest rates will continue to result in households loading up on debt. The Office for Budget Responsibility said UK households are expected to spend £58bn more than they earn this year, rising to £68bn by the end of the decade.
