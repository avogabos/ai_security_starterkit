Labour plans mansion tax to boost NHS
It is widely reported that Ed Miliband will announce plans to introduce a “mansion tax” to fund increased NHS spending when he addresses the Labour Party conference today. The BBC states that the party has yet to spell out details of how its mansion tax would work, but notes but the Institute of Fiscal Studies has suggested such a levy could raise around £1.7bn a year. Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, said the tax would be raised in "a fair, sensible and proportionate way", putting in place "protections for those who are asset rich and cash poor". The proposed tax on homes worth more than £2m is predicted by the Liberal Democrats – the original authors of the “mansion tax” plan – to raise £1.2bn. The Guardian reports that Labour is also planning to raise additional funding for the NHS by introducing a windfall tax on the profits of UK tobacco companies. Elsewhere, former Bank of England monetary policy committee member Kate Barker has called for a capital gains tax to be charged on main residences as a way of cutting property inflation. Ms Barker suggests the reform, although politically controversial, is the best way of tackling the UK's under-supply of housing.

Ukip wants IHT abolished
The Daily Express reports that Ukip is to include a pledge to abolish inheritance tax in its manifesto for next year's general election. Ukip insiders are said to believe the 40% duty, worth £3.5bn to the Treasury this year, is fundamentally unjust. Ukip economics spokesman Patrick O'Flynn is set to tell the Party’s conference: “Tax was already paid on this wealth in life - it should not now be levied on death as well.” Figures recently released by the OBR forecast annual Treasury receipts from inheritance tax are set to rise to £5.8bn by 2018-19, while another study quoted by the paper indicates that Britain and Ireland have the highest levels of inheritance tax in the world.

Devolution pledge raises tax questions
HSBC’s Stephen King writes in the FT that Westminster’s pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland has opened a “Pandora’s Box” that raises the prospect of similar powers being granted to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr King is one of several commentators to speculate on the effects of greater powers for Scotland, and suggests that increased devolution for all nations in the UK “would presumably mean we’d soon be living in a world of local income taxes and local bond issuance.” In the Evening Standard, Mark Boleat argues that London should receive more powers over taxes in light of the Scotland vote. Meanwhile, the First Minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, has said his Finance Department is preparing a paper examining the costs and benefits of devolving taxes to Northern Ireland. Elsewhere, the Key Cities group, which is made up of 23 smaller cities including Hull, Derby and Portsmouth, has published a charter demanding greater control of spending and tax.

Report says tax dodging isn’t declining
Tax Research UK’s Richard Murphy has told a fringe meeting at the Labour party conference that tax dodging has barely decreased since 2008 and is currently costing the country £80bn a year. In a report for the civil servants’ Public and Commercial Services union he proposes a range of measures, including a reversal of HMRC job cuts, in order to stop the amount rising to £100bn by 2018. “This report provides the most detailed explanation of tax evasion in the UK economy offered by anyone to date, revealing it could be almost four times as much as HMRC’s estimate,” he comments.

Embassies avoid business rates
The Evening Standard reports that 51 embassies and diplomatic missions in London owe HMRC a total of £670,000 after failing to pay business rates bills. Diplomatic representatives from foreign countries are officially exempt from all national, regional or municipal taxes for their buildings. However, the Government has encouraged most to pay a "beneficial portion" of their bill which works out at 6% of what any other business would pay, but a shortfall of over half a million pounds still remains.

Tesco uncovers £250m accounting error
Tesco has suspended four senior executives after uncovering an accounting error that means profits for the last six months have been overstated by £250m. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the board had asked Deloitte and Freshfields to conduct an independent review into the accounting irregularities, and had referred the matter the Financial Conduct Authority. The company has suspended its UK MD Chris Bush and UK finance director Carl Rogberg as well as John Scouler, its food commercial director, and Matt Simister, the head of food sourcing. Tesco has also delayed the publication of its interim results by three weeks to October 23 and issued a new profit warning. The Times’ Miles Costello is one of several commentators to reflect on the implications for Tesco’s long-term auditor PwC, quoting a leading Tesco shareholder as stating: “I'm not saying that PwC were in the wrong or did anything wrong, but it seems pretty poor not to have known about this stuff.”

SME lender unveils float plans
Challenger bank Aldermore has unveiled plans for a stock market float as it targets a shortfall of up to £65bn in the market for SME lending. Phillip Monks, chief executive, pointed to a recent report from KPMG, which suggested banks have shrunk their balance sheets by as much £1.7trn since 2008. “The data shows what a rough time of it SMEs have had," he said. "Many banks are simply no longer operating in these areas and in some cases there has been indiscriminate withdrawal. Between 2012 and 2016, it is estimated that there will be a gap of between £25bn and £65bn.” Mr Monks also confirmed the business would stick to its four main areas of asset finance, invoice finance, commercial mortgages for SMEs, and residential mortgages.

Can challenger banks become serious SME players?
The Independent’s Ben Chu looks at how the emergence of challenger banks has helped improve funding for SMEs. He notes, however, that the SME market is still largely controlled by RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. Jonathan Rose, a partner at Capco, expresses scepticism about whether the challenger banks can grow organically into serious players. He points to problems with the banking “ecosystem”, such as the fact that it is easier for established banks to get regulatory approval to run with less capital on their balance sheets, and that the payments infrastructure is owned and controlled by the big players.
