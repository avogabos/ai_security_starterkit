Hi All,

 

We are halfway through the first full working week of 2013 and we need to
get our minds, souls and strategies into gear to Sell, Support and Sell some
more.

 

Last year we experienced a new market for our business. The new market was
far less favourable and as a result sales and customer service fell
dramatically. We made a shift in offering and outlined a better way to
manage our existing and new customers. This shift in strategy will enable us
to bring about a positive outlook for 2013.

 

This year we have several aims

 

Company:

To widen our network of partners and resellers of our standard solution

To strengthen our product offering and deliver turnkey solutions to markets
where no other exists

To ensure all services are delivered efficiently and with customer care in
mind

To provide sophisticated products and services to a worldwide marketplace

To increase the companys profitability

 

Team:

To collaborate ideas and strategies

To highlight strengths and support weaknesses

To engage each other in discussions that bring market intelligence

To remember that one team cannot work without the other

To make Sales

 

Individual:

To progress market/ product and industry knowledge

To understand every client/ reseller business strategy and keep notes so as
to better and reactively manage the client sales opportunities

To speak out about product/ admin or team issues

To work as part of a team as part of a company

To make money!

 

Your targets are as follows

Sales: £8.5k each person (pro rata for Amiraah)

Support: £4.5k each person

 

Every week we will try to have a group call. At least once a month (so 1 in
every 4 or 5 calls) I want each person to have at some point provided a
value story on how they turned around a sale, signed up a reseller or
uncovered hidden opportunity. This is not a time to boast or just run off
details of each sale. This is a moment for everyone to learn more through
eachothers experiences.

 

Gloating does not keep the boat floating!

Teaching keeps everyone reaching!

 

Ok enough of the anecdotes  lets focus on bringing in the business.

 

Kind Regards,
