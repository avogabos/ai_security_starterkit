Hi Steve,

Further to our purchase of Mobile Digital Ltd, Registered number 09469967, please could you amend the details of Registered Office lodged with Companies House to the following:

Mobile Digital Limited
83 Ducie Street
Manchester
M1 2JQ

Please could you provide us with the Company House e-filing PIN number so that I can make further amendments at Companies House when two new directors join the board in the next few weeks.

Kind regards,

Alison Crawford

Meanwhile, please see the attach file and provide us with SIC (business activity) code that you wish to set for the company.



Once company is transferred then you can send request at support@formationshouse.com<mailto:support@formationshouse.com> for online filing pin from Companies House.



And regarding 'IDEAL DIGITAL LTD', the company has been purchased by another customer and if you are interested, please check our UK Ready-Made companies list on your website and choose any other company.

Dear Steve,



Thank you for your email. I have attached scans of my passport and a recent credit card statement.



I have also paid the sum of £265 by BACS Faster Payments to your Santander account and I attach a screen shot of the successful payment.



Please note that my assistant had incorrectly transcribed my date of birth in your system. My correct date of birth is 5th March 1961. Do you have the online filing PIN from Companies House so that I can update the company's registered office and my appointment details?



There was a second company of yours that I was considering purchasing but when I tried to select it just now, the system said that it wasn't available. Please could you verify the status of Ideal Digital Ltd? Many thanks.



Regards,



Alison Crawford
