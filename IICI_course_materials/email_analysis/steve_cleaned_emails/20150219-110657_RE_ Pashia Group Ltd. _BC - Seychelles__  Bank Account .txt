Hello Steve,

I have no heard anything back about the appointment with the bank in
Singapore for next week.   
As its too close to the date now it will need to be pushed back to week of
April 5th.
I can't remind you again how important this is as I'm having to use personal
funds for my business expenses without a bank account, and we're working on
this since December last year.  As I'm paying extra for this service I find
this not very acceptable.

Kind Regards,

Reto
