Dear Steve, 
 
Further to my recent e-mail, I am now taking this opportunity to attach the final documentation required for compliance purposes in order to set the Company up as instructed. Just to clarify the situation, the full name of the incorporating proposer is DR HARMANDER SINGH GUPTA, of 46 ROYCROFT ROAD FILTON BRISTOL BS34 7NN, DATE OF BIRTH 03.02.1942. Having looked at the paperwork, and as a former Solicitor myself, I believe that you have all the paperwork that you require now in order to proceed to incorporation, but if there is anything further would you please contact me on Monday first thing on my cell number so matters can be appropriately finalised. 
 
Yours sincerely
