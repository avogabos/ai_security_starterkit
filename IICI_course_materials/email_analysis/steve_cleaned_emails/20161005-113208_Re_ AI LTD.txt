Hi,

DPS and SPS - Directors Privacy Service and Shareholder Protection Service

DPS and SPS are services which enables Company directors and shareholders to keep their personal information away from prying eyes and increase the level of security for themselves and their families. Under normal circumstances, the personal details of company directors and shareholders (residential address) can be viewed by anyone who wishes to see the information.

For a very modest fee, we will provide a "service address" from our central London offices, which will be the only address visible to the general public.

The service address can be used for the receipt of documents on behalf of the company director(s) and shareholder(s), which can be held for collection or forwarded to any address in the world.

DPS and SPS provides company directors and shareholders with a higher level of personal privacy than they would normally have and consequently raises their level of personal safety.

The cost of the DPS and SPS service is

- DPS : GBP 150 (per annum)
- SPS : GBP 150 (per annum)

We do not charge any additional fees other than the cost of posting where mail is to be forwarded to another address.

Regards

Steve...
