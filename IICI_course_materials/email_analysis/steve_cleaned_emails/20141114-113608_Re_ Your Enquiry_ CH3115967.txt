Dear Sir

company number: 08334222
company name: SV BUSINESS WORKS LTD

Thank you for your recent e-mail concerning the restoration of the above company.

Please note that if the above company is being restored to continue to trade the company can apply for an application for administrative restoration.

 A form RT01 is required with an administrative fee of £100 and all outstanding documents - accounts for the period ending  31/12/2013.  There are no late filing penalties as the first accounts were due for filing after the company was struck off the register.

A Bona Vacantia waiver letter which can be obtained from the treasury solicitors website-https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1


Alternatively the company can apply to be restored by an order of court, all information on how to restore a company by this procedure can be found on-www.tsol.gov.uk. Please note that if the company is to be restored to trade all outstanding documents are also required to be filed.
