Hello everything has been paid please send me an invoice.

Dear Steve  am still waiting since January for you to sort out the Corporation Tax mistake and you have to notified me yet of any progress.

Please do so as soon as possible.

I am counting on your support since I have paid for this service and I do not want any problems with the HMRC.

In anticipation of your reply, please treat this mater as URGENT it has been  months and yet no reply!

Best regards,

Maria Banakou
