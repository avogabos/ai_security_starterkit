Dear Sir 

Re - E R R G Limited - 3113567 

The above company was dissolved under Section 652a, on 9th December 1997. 

The Administrative Restoration procedure does not apply to companies struck
off the Register at their own request. 

A company that has voluntarily applied to be struck off, can only be
restored by an Order of Court. 

Information regarding this process can be obtained from the Treasury
Solicitors website- www.tsol.gov.uk <http://www.tsol.gov.uk>  , or from our
website: www.companieshouse.gov.uk <http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk> . 

Please note, under the new Companies Act, the above company would have until
1st October 2015, to apply for its restoration. 

Yours faithfully 

Mr A. Owen 

Restoration Department.
