Unfortunately the banks in the UK have entirely changed the way they look at
any and all financial instruments. Every potential transaction is considered
on a case by case basis directly with the bank and not using intermediaries.
For this reason we cannot assist, but advise they contact Barclays corporate
directly. In may cases the issues arise with the compliance and not the
banks ability to service the instrument
