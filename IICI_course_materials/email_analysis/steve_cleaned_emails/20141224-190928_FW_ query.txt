Hi

 

I would like to open a Hong Kong company, and have a number of questions. 

These mainly concern:

 

1) any regulation applying to a company trading equities, and deriving income from such training, outside Hong Kong, effectivley acting as a trust.

 

2) what are the requirements for accounting reporting. Is there any samples you can send me (of what a yearly accounting looks like). What are the cost involved.Can they be self managed or do I need an outside company?
