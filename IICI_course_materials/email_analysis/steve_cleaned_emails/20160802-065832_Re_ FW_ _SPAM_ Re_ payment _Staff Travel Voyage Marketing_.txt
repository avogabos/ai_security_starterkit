Dear Phil and Paul
Staff Travel Voyage Marketing is in registration process with
Seychelles registry, to complete the registration registry has came up with one
more requirement, they need company director/s to put following information on
the paper and sign it.
Business activity of the Company is Investment in Tourism
Business, the source of funds is from personal savings and income and the
geography of business is Global (please do mention few major country names)
It would be better if you put it on Staff Travel Voyage Limited letterhead.
Please arrange the above document as soon as possible.
Regards
Steve…

Hi Steve
Attached are docs requested for Lisa and myself. We are not
in a position to have these certified as are travelling extensively at the
moment. When we submitted them before for GTI you kindly did the certification,
very much appreciate if you can do again, especially as we are known to you for
many years and have various companies with you etc.
Best regards
