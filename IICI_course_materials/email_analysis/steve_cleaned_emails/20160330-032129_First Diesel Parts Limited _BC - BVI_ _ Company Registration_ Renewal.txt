Dear Steve,thanks for your kind information.

Firstly I would inform you that I still have GBP 500 deposit,that last time on November for nominee director service order no 187041 that canceled 
And I thought the fund is use for registration renewal this year, (Please check attachment for Bank T/T receipt) because there no notification email before expired on February 

I hope you can understand and give me a break for the penalty,and for the price increase I will send the balance ASAP.

I waiting for your reply

Best Regards

David
