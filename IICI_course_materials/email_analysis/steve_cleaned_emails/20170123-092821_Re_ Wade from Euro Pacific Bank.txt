Re: Wade from Euro Pacific Bank
Ok now I
understand...so you have to send to the bank the documents of Worldwide so they
can finally open the account...they were asking us, and obviously we dont have
anything about that company. We appreciate if you send the documents required
as soon as possible so we can start using our company. Also I would like to
know when are ypou going to send us the original documents of both companies
(BVI and HK) so we have them with us.
Thank you,

Dear Angela
If you have gone through our
website, it is mention for Hong Kong companies that a Hong Kong company must
appoint a company secretary who must be a resident of Hong Kong. You see it on
this link :
http://www.formationshouse.
com/hongkongcompany.php
.
Also during the registration process
at different stages Hong Kong registry requires online signatures.
Therefore to complete above
requirements we appoint ourselves known as WorldWide Ventures Ltd as Company
Secretary and Shareholder. WorldWide Ventures Ltd stays as Company Secretary
but at the year end, when annual returns filing is done for the company
WorldWide Ventures Ltd is removed as shareholder by transferring its share to
company owner. To execute share transfer signatures are required on
stock/shares transfer form by transferee and transferor and then the form is
submitted to Hong Kong registry and records are updated.
This process will also resolve the
issue with bank account process.

Thank you

Did you receive
any reply from the agent about WORLDWIDE VENTURES?  As per the corporate
documents they are a shareholder of which we will need corresponding
documentation as I have mentioned previously, alternative the agent will need
to provide the document to show that WORLDWIDE VENTURES no longer holds any
shares of the company.
