Dear Steve,

I just received this letter.

It is written: «  Please note that we charge interest where you have paid late a PAYE or Construction Industry Scheme charge that was due for payment on 19 April 2014 or later. »

Why I have not been informed?
Thank you to tell me what I should do.

Kind Regards,
Jean Jacques Gomez.
