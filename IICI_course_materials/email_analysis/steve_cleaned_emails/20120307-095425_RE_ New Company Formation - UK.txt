 Hello Thanks for your revert! You did mention in your email that a tax reference number will be allocated to your company.  However, I don't quite understand why will it be given to your company and not ours.  Or - do you mean you will receive on our behalf as a receiving agent. Kindly clarify this - I do appreciate your collaborate.

Hello
Steve 

I do appreciate your inform!  As per our earlier disucssion, I take
interest in starting trade in the UK.  A new company as you've suggested
is beneficial and crutial for the commence of commerce.  I also did forget
to ask you on the double tax scheme or treaty between the UK & US
as this is too of much concern for us.  Kindly provide details on this
effect.

To further my understanding, the fee schedule for the services are detailed as
follows:

 

£ 50  For Company Formation

£ 25  Local Address Support

£ 500  Company Bank Account Formation

 

In addition to these steps - a Tax Reference Number will be countable for the
declaration of yearly or quarterly taxes.  Please do send me all and any
forms for completeness.

I await your revert and appreciate your collaborate.

 

Yours truly

Marie Hdez-Vega
