I also read about this and the poss option to have the Sey IBC owned by a
trust.

Is the bit below relevant if I spend much of my time in the UK and also
operate a British Ltd company called Staff Travel Ltd which does same
business ?(will adopt 10% of the overseas biz activity)

I have a trust in the isle of Man in name of my kids. Or another one could
be formed with you.

Appreciate advice

Phil

======================================
The Seychelles IBC & Belize Trust Combo

If you live in a country that has the power to tax any Offshore Company
which is seen to be managed and controlled from onshore and/or if you want
to keep details as to the underlying ownership of your IBC as quiet as
possible, (and/or if you want to have the option of avoiding having to
declare your IBC’s profits to local tax authorities) then you would be wise
to consider setting up an Offshore Trust (or Private Interest Foundation)
to hold the shares of your IBC.



*Why Have a Trust Holding the Shares of Your IBC?*



First up you might like to click through to the page on Offshore Trusts
<http://offshoreincorporate.com/offshore-trusts/> which explains in detail
the benefits of setting up a Trust to hold the shares of your IBC.



In summary if you set up a Trust to hold the shares of your IBC this shifts
the legal ownership of your IBC to a third party ie the Trustee.



Provided you set up a “Discretionary Trust” not only do you make it all but
impossible for vultures to attack assets held by the IBC (and provided you
are not seen to be a “presently entitled” beneficiary of the Trust) it may
be possible to avoid having to declare onshore the earnings of your IBC.



Even better still you might want to consider setting up your IBC in one Tax
Haven and the Trust in another (the more hurdles you make them jump over
the harder it is for vultures to attack your hard-earned!).
