Hello Steve,

I am writing to you with reference to the company J.S. Commerce Ltd. Last
Friday we have sent a request to Formations House to ship the documents
with DHL. Please find below the copy of the letter that had been forwarded
to *support@formationshouse.com <support@formationshouse.com>:*



*Dear Oliver and Steve,*

*Please accept my sincere congratulations on Christmas and New Year Day. *
*I kindly ask you to check whether the Apostille for Statutory Documents of
J.S. Commerce Ltd is ready? *

*Also I would like the hard copies of the apostilled documents to be sent
with express mail courier DHL. Please advise how I can proceed with the
payment for the delivery? Can I provide you with my credit card details
over the phone so you can charge the cost of DHL? *


*Awaiting for your reply,Best regards,*

*Oleksandr Koval*
*J.S. Commerce Ltd*

Unfortunately the mentioned above request was not taken into consideration
and you sent the documents with Royal Mail (as far as we understood).
Honestly speaking we are too much concerned about the parcel not to be lost
in transit because the Moldovan post does not work pretty well. Therefore
we will very much appreciate if you manage to retract the shipment and send
the documents with express mail courier (DHL). From our part we guarantee
to redeem the shipping cost. If this solution to the occurred problem seems
to be impossible, please provide us, at least, with the tracking number for
the sent parcel in order us to be able to track it.

Your early reply will be highly appreciated,
Best regards,
Victoria
Secretary of J.S. Commerce Ltd
