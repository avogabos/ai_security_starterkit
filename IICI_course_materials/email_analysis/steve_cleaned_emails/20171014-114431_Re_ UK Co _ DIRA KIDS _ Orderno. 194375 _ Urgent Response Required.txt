Hi,
Yes I confirm that for the directors you can use the addresses as per their
bank statements.

For Namrata her full Street address is, Way 6, house 170, Al Mouj, Muscat,
Oman

Full Street address for suchitra is house 3886, way 1853, qurum, Muscat,
116, Oman


If you cannot use a company as a director then 60% will be in my name,
Lubna Kharusi. My full Street address is 87A Fahoud street, Qurum, Muscat,
PC 116, Oman...
Though is there another form of limited liability company that a company
can be a shareholder than I would rather that.. please advise.

With gratitude,
Lubna
