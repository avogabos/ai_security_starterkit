Thank you Steve, for bank accounts, you can proceed to charge payment for service using the card details for each company we provided earlier at the time of company formation order.

Dear Angela
Thank you for sending the consent, I will update once it is received.
Also regarding bank account, we have not charged the payment yet, please confirm that we can charge payment for service using the card details you provided earlier at the time of company formation order. And should we charge for both companies or for Hong Kong company only to start the process and charge for BVI company after company registration is complete.
Waiting for your confirmation.
Regards
Steve…

Dear Angela
Please find attached corporate documents for the Hong Kong Company,
Please sign the ‘consent.pdf’ to act as director and send us the scan by email and hard copy by normal post so that we may forward the same to HK Registry,
And as soon as we receive the documents for BVI company we will start the registration process.
