Hi,

 

Following is the message from customer.

 

 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------

It is really delayed unfortunately.

I think, there is a communication problem. I don't want any misunderstanding
anymore.

Please register my trade as only "Lityus" 

I repeat with capitals : 

LITYUS

This is my last confirmation, and I only wait your confirmation

Pls explain that all words in the images are registered in a single trade
mark for the company Lityus. It is the logo with those words together that
make up the trademark. The words Intelligent Technology are not
trademarkable without the company name also, as these are common terms

 

Thanks
