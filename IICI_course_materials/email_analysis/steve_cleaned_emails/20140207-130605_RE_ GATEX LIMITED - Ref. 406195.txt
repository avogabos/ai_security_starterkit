Hi Steve,
I  have tried to get “Bank reference letter” with my new passport’s number specified, as been requested (see below). However I was told that Bank does not supply reference Letters with passport number or similar forms that contain passport number details.

-As the reference letter is also providing the passport number, please provide us with a new reference letter indicating the number of the renewed passport. (WE NEED A NEW ORIGINAL BANK REFERENCE LETTER BY POST WHICH MUST HAVE HIS NEW PASSPORT NUMBER)

Please provide a simple of Bank reference letter that expect me to provide.

Thanks
