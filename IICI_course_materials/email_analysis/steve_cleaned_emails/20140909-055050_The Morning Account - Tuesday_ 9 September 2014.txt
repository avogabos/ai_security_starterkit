Lib Dems unveil tax policies
The Liberal Democrats' draft manifesto for next May's general election contains proposals to increase taxes for the wealthiest members of society. The party says it would press for higher CGT to bring it more closely in line with income tax. It has also pledged to shake-up tax relief for entrepreneurs so that it does not provide a tax loophole for the super-rich, and restrict access to "non-domicile" tax status for foreigners living in Britain who do not pay tax on their earnings abroad. Tax relief on pensions meanwhile would be limited to a pension pot of £1m, down from £1.4m at present. The Daily Mail suggests that the policies bring the party closer to Labour, which is drawing up plans for a tax on high-value homes and has said that it would look at the CGT threshold.

Brown outlines further powers timetable
Gordon Brown has set out a timetable for boosting the Scottish Parliament's control over finance, welfare and taxation if voters reject independence. In a speech in Midlothian, Mr Brown said details of fresh devolution of tax and welfare powers would be agreed by late November and legislation drafted next January. With a pro-independence victory now appearing a realistic possibility, financial advisers are reporting an increase in the number of private investors concerned about the risks attached to an independent Scotland. In the Telegraph, Allister Heath writes that investors should expect other separatists across Europe to seize on a Yes victory to inspire similar campaigns. The FT notes that the employment consequences of a Yes vote in areas such as East Kilbride are significant, with more than 2,400 people in the region employed by HMRC.

Suspend stamp duty to boost sales
Experts have suggested suspending stamp duty on homes under £500,000, saying the move would "immediately boost" housing sales. Land Registry figures indicate the last time the government gave homeowners a year-long stamp duty holiday, property sales increased by 33%. Paul Edgington, spokesman for estate agents Connells, said: "Where we had stamp duty holidays and exemptions in the past for first-time buyers there has been an immediate boost." A recent survey has identified that increases in stamp duty and the prospect of a mansion tax have contributed to over 50% of central London homes worth more than £2m being withdrawn from sale in 2014.

Firm wins VAT appeal over recession
A Scottish electronics firm has convinced a tax judge that the harsh effect of the recession was a "reasonable excuse" for failing to pay a VAT bill on time. Scrimsign Micro-Electronics Ltd faced default charges worth thousands of pounds after failing to make VAT payments before deadlines in 2012. A tax tribunal judge has now ruled the firm should be exempt from the charges. He said Scrimsign's late payments were due to "factors flowing from the general effects of the recession".

Umunna unveils SME support plan
Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna has unveiled a US style plan to help SMEs to expand and grow, at an event held at KPMG in Manchester. Modelled on the United States' Small Business Administration, the Labour MP said the UK SBA will work to improve the support available, identify opportunities and remove barriers to business growth. "We need to ensure that our different government departments give SMEs a look in when awarding contracts. But also there is another role which the US model plays, which is to ensure businesses get counselling and advice,” he stated.

SMEs prepare for independence
An increasing number of SMEs are for the first time considering moving south of the border in the event that Scotland votes in favour of independence. "The message needs to go out from Scottish business," said Ghill Donald of BD Network, "If there's a Yes vote, we're leaving." Elsewhere, the Telegraph publishes a guide for SMEs on how best to protect business from the export risks that may arise in the event of Scottish independence.

Upping the price of escaping taxes
The US State Department has increased the processing fee for those wishing to renounce their citizenship to $2,350. The FT suggests the move is a response to record numbers trying to escape the US tax system, which requires personal filings from its citizens regardless of whether they still live and work in the country. Politicians are also calling for measures to be introduced to make it more costly for US firms to redomicile. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has warned that a rush of foreign takeovers by US companies seeking to reduce their domestic tax bills could lead to recent cuts in the country's $492bn budget deficit being reversed.

ECONOMY

Pound falls following referendum poll
The value of the pound has fallen in the wake of an opinion poll which suggests the pro-UK campaign has lost its lead ahead of the Scottish independence referendum. Sterling fell by about 1.3% against the US dollar to a 10-month low of $1.61. Shares in some firms with Scottish links also fell, with Standard Life dropping 3%, Royal Bank of Scotland slipping 2.4% and Lloyds Banking Group, which owns Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows, falling 2.7%. Managers of global investment funds at Fidelity Worldwide Investment predicted that there would be a “strong bounce in sterling' if there were to be a 'no' vote. In the case of a 'yes' vote 'things would get messier.” Economist Paul Krugman has warned Scotland it is unsafe to vote yes while uncertainty about the country's currency remained. "If Scottish voters really believe that it's safe to become a country without a currency, they have been badly misled," he stated.

Retired couples have an excess of money
A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests couples who have retired in the past decade have more money than they need to cover their retirement years. The IFS says its findings reveal that 92% of couples born in the 1940s had much more money than they needed to maintain their standard of living once they had stopped work. The survey suggested the average amount of cash left over in retirement pots after spending on essentials was covered was more than £220,000 - enough to buy an annuity, or income for life, generating £7,000 a year.
