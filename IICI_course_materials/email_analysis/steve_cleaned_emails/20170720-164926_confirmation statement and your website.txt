Dear Mr. Steve,

first I'm trying to renew online company administrator service, but I can'
t do it through your website. What is it happening ?

Second, if I don' t make mistakes, my company, Frozen Yogurt ltd, has to
send confirmation statement by next August 3rd. Is it ?

Please, let me know something, I already emailed to support department
without any reply.

Kindest regards
