Hi Steve

Thanks for the login to the website, I have been able to login and access the various documents.

I notice that there is a section called Bank Form on the LLP Gatex but not MC Capital - is this correct.

I presume you need us to complete this - is this correct?

Apart from the Bank Account set-up is there anything else you need us to do.

Thanks
Chris
