Hi Support

For these forms as some need 2 peoples signature on and these people are in
different countries, is it acceptable to have 2 forms for each, each signed
by 1 of the 2 people so you can file together?

Dear Customer,
Thank you for your email.
Please note that in order to issue original copy of incumbency and notarize it, registry requires the share transfer forms to be signed and email to them so that they can update their records and notarize the correct incumbency.
They will not issue or notarize the original incumbency until unless they receive the signed share transfer forms.
We request you to please forward us the signed forms as soon as possible.
Best Regards,
