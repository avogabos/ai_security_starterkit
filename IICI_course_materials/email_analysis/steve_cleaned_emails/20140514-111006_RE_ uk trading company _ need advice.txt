We can supply a uk ready made with bank account, but we cant guarantee
credit lines. The companies are clean companies but credit line applications
would be made independently.

 

We also have companies without bank account that have a high filed
capitalisation of £2m.  these would likely get large credit lines. You could
then open a bank account for the company directly

 

One additional point to consider is that US citizens will find it hard to
open or take over a bank account. 

 

They would need to use a nominee, our service would require the managed
company service but we would not allow large credit lines to be opened and
therefore the client would need to source their own Nominee

The client is from America

 

Most specifically we need a aged corporation (maybe only 4-5yrs), bank
account, trade credit lines (around 1million no less than 500K) with a
excellent credit score and will stand up to a bank due diligence process (so
we can leverage a acquisition loan or assume a current loan of an existing
business) with Certificate of Corporation Good Standing, and all schedule
filings up to date. Our budget is $10,000 USD. Not sure if you have anything
that will fit this criteria but please let us know. If not what are our
options. We have a address in UK, agent of service we can talk about more;
and residency requirements currently being achieved as well.

 

 

Please advice
