** The UK Companies House publishes changes in PSC registers for Scottish LPs.
------------------------------------------------------------
From July 24th all Scottish Limited Partnerships must register information about PSC (Persons with Significant Control) with the UK Companies House.

PSC information requirements for Scottish LPs will remain the same as for Limited companies and Limited Liability Partnerships, which are in action and in public use already as of June 30th 2016.
The special requirements were introduced in the UK almost a year ago in accordance with Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 2017. Although, the rules of PSC did not apply to Limited Partnerships. However, Scottish Limited Partnerships were under consideration already a year ago, as unlike English, Wales or Northern Irish LPs, Scottish LPs have a distinct legal personality. It was planned back in April 2016 that Scottish LPs will have to introduce their PSC information by the end of July 2017. And so that happened.

The UK regulation on PSC information received criticism back in 2016 for an extreme application of the ЕС Money Laundering 4th Directive, as the personal data of the business owners, their home addresses and dates of birth appeared to be publicly accessible for any third party on the Companies House web site.

But as of this summer there are some changes to PSC information submition. It is obvious that all active Scottish LPs are to maintain PSC registers also and must submit their forms within 2 weeks after July 24th. Any new LP registered after July 24th 2017 will have to provide PSC information along with incorporation.

There is a hope that protection regime will be available for Scottish LPs. It might be allowed for LPs owners to apply to the Companies House for a restriction so the personal information isn’t disclosed on the public register. Only specified public authorities shall access the PSC registers upon request. It is planned that the access will also be granted to the banks and other financial institutions, so they can verify PSC’s data.

How exactly the PSC requirements will be introduced for Scottish Limited Partnerships and will the protection regime be available for all LPs owners, we will know very soon. We will keep you updated on the upcoming changes!
