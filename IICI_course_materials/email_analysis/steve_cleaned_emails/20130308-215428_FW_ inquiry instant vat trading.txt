Hi Oliver,

 

Yes Im interested in this product I just have one further question.

 

I need this MTS for a UK Ltd company and not for my name.

Of course I can provide you my identification with ID and utility bills and
also that Im the owner and director. 

Do you need the company documents as well like incorporation certification
etc.?

Hi Steffen

 

We can provide you MANAGED TAX SYSTEM for instant VAT invoicing

 

 

MANAGED TAX SYSTEM: 

 

 Invoice your customers and charge them VAT immediately 

 

 Allows you to clear goods from customs 

 

 Allows your customers to pay you in local currency into an existing local
bank account  

 

 Collects payment for you worldwide and transfer them to any bank account in
any currency worldwide    

 

 

 Managed Tax System 

  

 The Managed Tax System product was developed to allow companies to trade
immediately, who have not 

gone through the formal process of registering for VAT or getting a Tax ID
and opening a local bank account. 

 

It can be used as a temporary measure until you get your own registration
through or as permanent solution 

for your global trading needs.

 

What does it do?

 

·        The Managed Tax System (MTS) allows you to invoice your customers
and charge them VAT immediately.

·        MTS allows you to clear goods from customs.

·        MTS allows your customers to pay you in local currency into an
existing local bank account.

·        We collect payments for you worldwide and transfer them to any bank
account in any currency worldwide.

 

How does it work?

 

·        We invoice your customer for your goods and services, and we also
charge them VAT if applicable.

·        We collect the payment from your customer. Your customer can pay
via credit card or bank transfer.

·        Once we have collected the payment we pass the payment on to you.

·        The invoice contains your logo but our Tax ID and Bank Data. As far
as your customer is concerned you have outsourced your accounting to us
Accounts Centre, because of the name of our company most of your customers
will assume that Accounts Centre is either department in your company or an
outsourced accounting service.

 

How much does it cost?

 

It costs £100 to setup and then £25 per month. You have to pay 3 months in
advance.

There is also 2% transaction fee per invoice. 

If your customer pays via credit card then an additional 2.5% will be
charged.

 

How long does it take to setup?

 

Setup can take between 1 to 3 working days.

 

What are the requirements?

 

We need to undertake normal due diligence on yourself. We have to identify
you as person. This can be accomplished by obtaining identity documents such
as passport and proof of address. 

 

Please let me know if you want to place the order

 

Best regards

 

Oliver
