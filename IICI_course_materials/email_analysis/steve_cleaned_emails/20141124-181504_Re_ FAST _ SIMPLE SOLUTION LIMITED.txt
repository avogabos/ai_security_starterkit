Hi Maria
Yes the complete amount for renewal is GBP 215 which will
include:
-
Renewal of Registered Address : GBP 100
-
Renewal of Online Company Administrator Service : GBP 25
-
Annual Returns Filing : GBP 15
-
Dormant Accounts Filing : GBP 75
You need to renew the services and files annual returns by 23
rd
Dec 2014. Late filing of annual returns can cause penalties. However for Annual
Accounts that can be done in January.
Or if you wish to close the company then the cost will be GBP 75
but you must place the order this month Nov 2014. Otherwise in Dec you will
need to renew the service and file Annual Returns and then process company
closure.
Regards
Steve
