I am honored to be a friend to you. i got your email in my search for a
 reliable person in your country, let me tell you a little about me, My
name is Bee Zaman, born in the city of damascus, Syria . I am the only girl
of my parents who I have lost to a chemical weapon attack in Damascus last
year. i also lost my husband to the same chemical weapon attack, if you
have been currently reading the news, you will understand what I am saying
better. I work as a nurse in the new medical center here in Damascus, but
this no longer works due to the nature of this war here. we all live in
fear here no one knows who will be the next to die. I ran to the military
refugee camp here in Damascus for the insurance of my life because I really
do not want to die here. I don't want to finish my family lineage. here in
the camp, the army prevent us from the use of social networks, the use of
the computers, and even of the camera and cell phone. this, as they say it
is for security reasons.

i am writing to you because I intend to relocate to your country to start a
new life and I need a God fearing man with whom I will be friends, for now,
to see what will come out of it. I need a good man who will be my friend,
and if something good come out of the friendship, I will marry him. when I
saw your reply, you seems good and more of a real person. I would like to
be your friend and getting to know you more better. I would like to know
more about you, are you married? do you have children? are your children
with you? what is your occupation? do you smoke? what do drugs? my friend I
would like to know more about you and would love to have your photos too.
below is mine

regards
Bee
