Hi Olegs

 

 

Thank you for your interest in our services.

 

 

We can certainly offer you UK Ready Made Companies with already opened UK
bank accounts. However please note that in order to transfer signatory for
bank account company director will be required to come to UK and visit the
bank. In case if you cannot visit UK to transfer bank account signatory,
then we can offer you our basic UK Ready Made companies and we open a new
offshore bank account.

 

 

You can view list of UK readymade companies without bank account on the
following link:

http://www.formationshouse.com/search/readymade.php


New bank account for readymade companies can be processed with following
banks:


- Barclays Bank - UK (for UK companies only, company director/s presence
will be required)

- Royal Bank of Scotland - UK (for UK companies only, company director/s
presence will be required)

- OCBC Bank. Singapore (Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited): (Visit
required in London Branch)

- Euro Pacific Bank. St. Vincent (Skype meeting with customer directly, no
visit required)

- Rietumu Banka. Latvia (For EU base customers visit not required) (For non
EU customer visit is required in London)


The bank account opening service cost 500 GBP and takes 4-6 weeks to process
after company registration. Please note that we do not guarantee bank
account opening, the final decision is of the bank.


Documents required for due diligence for company:

Scan color copies of following documents are required for company
owner/director/s and shareholder/s


1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
2. Proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR
electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.


If the documents are not in English then you need to have them translated
and notorized. And send original and translated copies.


Please note that we are unable to process bank account for USA citizen or
resident.
