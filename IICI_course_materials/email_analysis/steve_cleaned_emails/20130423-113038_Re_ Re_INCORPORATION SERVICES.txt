Dear Mr. Smith,

I hope to confirm soon my client's decision to proceed with the registration through your company. As part of the company formation, I will be needing a resolution appointing me as the agent (Power of Attorney) to open and operate bank account/s at Bank of Valletta or any other local bank as required and to transact any business etc etc on behalf of the company. I will at the appropriate time send you all details.

Best regards

Edward Porter
