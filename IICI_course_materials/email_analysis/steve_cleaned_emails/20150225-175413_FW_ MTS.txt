Hi Steve

 

I need to form a video company, lowest formation cost initially, but has capabilities to enhance features in the future.

Must be VAT register and have a VAT ID number,

May also need bank and business card

As this will be a Video production company, need the option of purchasing business equipment without VAT.

 

 

 

Best Regards

Victor Izu
