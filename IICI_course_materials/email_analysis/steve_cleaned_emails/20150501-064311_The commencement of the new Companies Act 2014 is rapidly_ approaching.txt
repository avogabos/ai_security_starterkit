Dear Steve,

The commencement of the Companies Act, 2014 is rapidly approaching.

And with it comes the requirement to look at any existing private limited companies
under your care to see if they should convert to the new form 'LTD' model or the
 'Designated Activity Company' type.

To assist you with this topic, my colleague, Sue Jesper, has prepared an excellent
Factsheet which sets out what is involved. Sue's Factsheet is available by simply
clicking here [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001POKGlGbMxcxV7CaJ5wc7enfS27Ul1TyWDVIxbfp1V9cxxbNrKQVoTytPNTxpsSaXMpiJDKc61eBQrUdac1JfNnKtiQXAPngV7uOE5Ik3g1Xc5oAc7xXwyj0vFvqO5B_WEFr9wjkcMjNF8AWq9tgTeSpjsah1NArDSXdGVR01xCwSIIDVQ301MVZ0wEBCafukhjrH_r8D4RmaDqeDPkSvFN-N3RZtAu6U7lXpM9OGt1fKQk11Pms1AMZiVfYW2fUE&c=_YWp7HDV31tET5MXLIEGVv9-42B29dquVitZNHC1rKv1zri9gBOP8w==&ch=iQtWx8nkGcJQ0ZphQwSsqOflT9TZXIWIpXa3hE-4bXU0HW9YUf86zg==].

COMPANIES ACT, 2014

Limited Company Conversion

The Companies Act 2014 sets out a "conversion" process which will be required for
all existing Companies Limited by Shares.

Upon commencement on June 1st 2015, there will be an 18 Month 'Transition Period'
during which existing private companies limited by shares will have to decide on
 which form they wish to take i.e. either LTD (Private Company Limited by Shares)
or DAC (Designated Activity Company).

What is an LTD?

An LTD is a simplified new-form private company limited by shares.  It will be by
far the most common company-type on the Register and a range of new reforms in the
Companies Act, 2014 will apply to it.

These will include having a one-document constitution, the ability to have a single
director, the power to dispense with an AGM and to have the contractual capacity
 of a natural person.

What is a DAC?

A DAC (Designated Activity Company) will be similar in format to the existing Private
Limited by Shares Company.  Its activities will be limited by its objects clause,
it will have a constitution that comprises of both a Memorandum and Articles of 
Association and it must have two Directors - not all of the new reforms and provisions
of the CA 2014 will apply to a DAC.
