Dear Steve

I am just doing this for a family member as they are not expert in English
documentation, In Iran we do not have MLR. You can remove my name from
contact person and I change the account under Mr.Alavi himself if you think
this will move us forward faster.

Please advise.

Regards
Ashkan
