Hi Steve 

 

U would appreciate a feedback your side as this is really getting pathetic
.. You received all funds aswell as data required and have not been able to
pass in information regarding process.. This can't be that we need to wait
for months to get a company registered.

Pls advise asap 

Thx and brgds
