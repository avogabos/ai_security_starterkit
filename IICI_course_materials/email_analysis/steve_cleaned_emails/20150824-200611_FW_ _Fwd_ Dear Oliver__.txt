Dear Oliver,

You spoke to my assistant few minutes ago.

Basically I am interested to open a Limited Company in the UK. The name I
would like is "Rising Light Entertainment Ltd.", could you please tell me if
it is available? If not available then try "Rising Light Productions Ltd."

I wish to have the costs to open a Limited Company with Directors Privacy
Service.

I will use the services of "LEO.co.uk" which offers Offices Addresses for
the address of that Limited Company.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

Irina Shengelidze
