Dear Mr Steve Smith,
I hope everything is well. I need to know this information.
We are opening the business account. To simplify the
procedure we would need to change the title of Mrs Maria Stella Pistone within
the corporate.
Mrs MS Pistone should be registered both as Director and
Secretary. In this way, Mrs MS Pistone will have same role his husband, Mr
Stefano Carboni and she will not need of
Mr S Carboni's signature to opening of the business account
and any subsequent transaction involving the company.
All this in view that Mrs MS Pistone moved to London to
follow the start-up of Company as well as partner in equal proportion to Mr S
Carboni.
Can you make this change into Company incorporation? If so,
how long does it take?
Thank you in advance.
I look forward to hear from you as soon as possible.
Best regards
Simonetta Stabile
