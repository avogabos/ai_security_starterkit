Good Company at Christmastime

Happy Christmas
2015
from all your friends at CFI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tannenbaum is one of my all-time favourite Christmas Carols - To me it captures 
the magic of mid-winter. We thought it would be a nice idea to give you a direct
 link to Pavarotti singing Tannenbaum in Vienna in the three-tenors show on 23rd
 December 1999.

Happy Christmas  Steve,
On behalf of all of us in Company Formations International Ltd (CFI) I'd like to
 wish you and yours a very happy Christmas - full of laughter and joy and all the
good things that make Christmas a very special time of the year in Ireland.
In this special 'mobile-friendly' edition of Christmas Good Company you'll find 
all your old favorites - Christmas Jokes, Carols, Seasonal thoughts to reflect upon
and, of course, warm wishes and happy seasonal greetings from all of us.
We hope that you get as much enjoyment from reading this year's Christmas Good Company
as everyone here in CFI got from carefully putting it together for you.
Yours sincerely

Séan Kavanagh
Managing Director

Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without...
... a special selection  of 'Good Company' jokes from all your friends in CFI.
You see, every Christmas, for more years than we care to remember (We're talking
 about way, way back in the old fax & pre-mobile phones & 1mb hard disk desktop 
computer days) we've put together a new annual  page of Christmas jokes and fun 
for all our friends - and their families - to enjoy at Christmastime.
To enjoy a merry Christmas 2015 chuckle with us...

Steve = Hailed as: "... the most beautiful piece of music ever 
written for the human voice - and the most gifted - beautiful human voice of all
 time to prove that is true.  No one will ever sing a song so beautifully", we thought
that it would be a nice idea to share it with you in the countdown to Christmas 
2015

Nessum dorma
(Nobody shall sleep)
Another heavenly song sung by Luciano Pavarotti. This time it was at the 1990 Fifa
World Cup in Italy: Nessum dorma captured the hearts and won the souls of hundreds
of millions of listeners worldwide.
In the countdown to Christmas 2015 we thought it would be a nice idea to share with
you a very special recording by Pavarotti in Paris of Nessum dorma, in 2007 and 
enjoyed by over twenty one million estatic fans on utube - an astonishingly big 
number of fans.

Timely Reminder
If you need:

The last day in 2015 to do this with CRO is the 18th December - which is far closer
than you might think. It's next Friday.
As Ireland's leading Company Incorporation Specialists, we'll be delighted to help
you, Steve

Steve, in our last few Ezines we included a click-through link 
to the CFI Company Questionnaire which we invited our customers and friends to complete
in order to speed up and streamline the company formation process for everyone.
We were pleasantly surprised at how popular this link was and how useful those of
our readers who were thinking - or even half-thinking - of forming a company, found
it.
