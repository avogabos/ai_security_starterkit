Dear Steve,

Is it possible that you provide nominee partners for UK LLP? What would 
be a total fee of one LLP?

Our clients ask whether the following names are available for LLPs:

1. Real Estate Solutions LLP
2. Real Estate Boutique LLP.

Best regards,
Andrei

Dear
            Andrei
Yes
            it is possible to register new LLPs, the cost will be:
-
LLP
            Registration 500 GBP
-
Registered
            Address 25 GBP (for the 1
st
year)
-
Bank
            Account 500 GBP
As
            per above cost the 2 LLPs will cost 2050 GBP.
You
            will be required to appoint 2 partners for each LLP. If
            you need UK bank account then partners will be required to
            come to UK,
            otherwise we can opne offshore bank account FBME. FBME is a
            Cayman Islands bank
            with branch office in Cyprus.
The
            LLP names are subject to availability. The name given you
            are already registered as private limited companies,
            therefore they might not
            be accepted, so we would advice if you can provide alternate
            names.

Dear Steve,
Do I understand correctly that the last column "cost" refers
            to the
            price of the shelf LLP? If this is the case I think that
            they are way too
            expensive for our clients and substantially exceed the
            balance that they have.
Would it be possible to establish two new LLPs:
1. Knowledge Digital LLP, and
2. Standard Select LLP.
Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Steve,
Thanks a lot for your email. Could you please clarify
                  financial issues before I
                  contact beneficial owners. I have to make them clear
                  offer that includes
                  information on outstanding financial issues. They paid
                  USD 1,635 each for Gambian
                  companies and other services. However, according to
                  their calculations each of
                  the beneficial owner received services on USD 310.
                  Therefore, both of them have
                  positive balance equal to USD 1,325.
I look forward to hearing from you asp.
Best regards,
Andrei

Dear Steve,
Thank you very much for your email.
Could you please indicate what would be 'the
                    additional cost' for a UK company
                    provided that our clients has only received
                    certificates of incorporation,
                    M&As and shares certificates (all documents in
                    electronic format).
                    Therefore, they received services only for USD310.
                    Other services/documents had
                    been paid according to the attached invoices but
                    were not received in fact.
Is it possible to buy this company as shelf ones
                    provided that our clients will
                    provide names of shareholders and directors later?
Best regards,
Andrei
