Hi Ivan
We do assist our customers for Swiss bank account, however Swiss
bank only open bank accounts for  UK companies and non-USA, NON- Columbia national

Swiss bank accounts do not provide services to offshore
companies and also they do not open bank accounts for people or companies based
in USA or Columbia.
