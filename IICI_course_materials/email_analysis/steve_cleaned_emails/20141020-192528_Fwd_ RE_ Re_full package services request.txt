Dear Steve,

My previous answer was:
"The Trusts jurisdictions must be: Spain, Belgium, Brazil, US, South 
Africa, Canada, France, Italy, UAE, Netherland, UK, Germany, Poland and 
Seychelles - 14 units. The Seychelles one will be used for personal 
wealth protection and the other 13 as investment shields."

My previous answer was this one. That list involves virtual offices.
"Would be possible to have your support also for the attached 
jurisdictions - virtual offices? For the ready-made companies can we 
exchange the name? Can we attach also other services?"

Please read with close attention my previous e-mail, here is just 1 
paragraph:
"We can have the Foundation in Gambia - charitable reason. This 
Foundation will be 100 % shareholder into other 127 ones in order to 
manage the entire structure from 1 single point. Each of those 127 
Foundations will be incorporated by skilled lawyers. Through these 
Foundations we\u2019ll have social projects all across the World, including 
in Africa (Gambia too). Can you give me more details and which are the 
next steps? What other services can be attached for the Foundation?"

Green regards,

Hi


Please confirm, the list (attachment) shows the list of countries, do 
you need TRUST in those countries? Because we only provide TRUST 
registration in Gambia.

Dear Steve,

Please find below my answers with \u201cA\u201d.

Sorry for the late reply.
A: Ok.

We can certainly assist you in registering the TRUST in Gambia.
A: We can have the Foundation in Gambia - charitable reason. This 
Foundation will be 100 % shareholder into other 127 ones in order to 
manage the entire structure from 1 single point. Each of those 127 
Foundations will be incorporated by skilled lawyers. Through these 
Foundations we\u2019ll have social projects all across the World, including 
in Africa (Gambia too). Can you give me more details and which are the 
next steps? What other services can be attached for the Foundation?

You can place the order for Trust companies on following link:
http://www.formationshouse.com/offshore_trust.htm
A: Ok.

Please confirm following:
- How many trust you would like to register
A: 14, 13: agriculture, business & industry, education, events & 
entertainment, finances, food & beverage, health & sport, IT & telecom, 
NGO, PR/communication & media, real estate & constructions, services, 
tourism + 1 Trust for our personal wealth / investments.

- what will be the activity of each trust
A: 13 of them will purchase properties, projects or will make 
investments on the above sectors. 1 Trust is dedicated to our personal 
wealth / investments.

- from where you receive the investment
A: In general from 127 countries, since our projects are established for 
a worldwide development.

- where the investment will be use
A: In general will be use in 127 countries, since our projects are 
established for a worldwide development.

We need above information to consult with bank, if bank can approve the 
bank accounts.
A: I see no obstacles for, since the Trusts will be used as a shield in 
order to protect our investments when we compete with competitors. For 
example we want to take-over a company and we have powerful competitors, 
in this case we\u2019ll use the Trust as a shield. After winning the 
competition and taking over that company we\u2019ll sell further the company 
to another member of Greenlife Consortium.

A: The Trusts jurisdictions must be: Spain, Belgium, Brazil, US, South 
Africa, Canada, France, Italy, UAE, Netherland, UK, Germany, Poland and 
Seychelles - 14 units. The Seychelles one will be used for personal 
wealth protection and the other 13 as investment shields.

A: We\u2019re interested to have as Trustees a bank/banks which will execute 
our investment interests and act as a shield. The bank/banks will not 
need to loan us money for the future investments, they will act just as 
payment platform, since the amounts will be wired from abroad into those 
banks.

A: Would be possible to have your support also for offshore 
jurisdictions, such as: Panama, Honk Kong, Mauritius, Switzerland, 
Cayman Islands, Nevada (US), Malta, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Marshall Islands? 
Can you give me more details and which are the next steps? What other 
services can be attached here? A part of them I already express it into 
my previous e-mail.

A: Would be possible to have your support also for the attached 
jurisdictions - virtual offices? For the ready-made companies can we 
exchange the name? Can we attach also other services?

A: We have prepared the names for Trusts and offshore companies.

Green regards,
