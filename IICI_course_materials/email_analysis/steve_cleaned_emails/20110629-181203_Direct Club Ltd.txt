Dear Steve,

here is the copy of converation between us and Barclays Bank (their last
answer).

Please still check the option to open bank account for our company, and when
you confirm us that it will be open, we will send you a payment and all
required documents.

Regards,

Slavko Ples,
Direct Club Ltd.

Dear Mr Ples,****

** **

Thank you for your email.****

** **

The Business questionnaire indicated that the ownership of the company is
outside the ****UK****.****

** **

Additionally, the questionnaire also indicates that the company activity
will be internet based and, as such, I must advise that we class this as a
higher risk activity for which there would be a minimum take on requirement
of Â£3million turn over per annum. ****

** **

At present Barclays Wealth do not have the appetite for this type of
business activity so we are therefore unable to offer you any banking
facilities.****

** **

I hope this helps to explain the reason for our decline.****

With regards,****

Dear Dawn,****

** **

we have a plan to open office in **London** very soon and employ 5-7 people
in it until the end of year, and because of that I'll come in
****London****probably next week.
****

** **

I don't see what is the real problem, why we cannot open a bank account.****

** **

We need to pay a rent fee for the office, we need to buy furniture for the
office, but how to do this without bank account.****

** **

Don't get me wrong, but it's a little ridiculous, right?****

** **

Barclays bank has a special department for international bank accounts, that
means accounts for companies which are owned and operated by non UK
residents, and you told me that the problem is "*the ownership and control
of the business entity is held outside of the UK."*****

** **

How to explain that?****

** **

If we want to come to your country, invest and pay tax in your country,
employ your residents, why we cannot open a simple bank account, pay an
opening fee and all other fees you charge?****

** **

We don't ask you for any loan or money, we want to give you our money, I
hope you understand that.****

** **

If you need a better explanation, please send me an email and I'll contact
you on the phone so I could give you all answers you need.****

** **

Loking forward your reply,****

** **

Regards,****

Dear Mr Ples,****

 ****

I write further to your interest in opening corporate bank accounts with
Barclays Wealth.****

 ****

I regret to advise you that, after careful consideration, we will be unable
to assist you in opening the required bank account. We have made this
decision based upon many factors including the expected turnover and the
commercial viability to Barclays, given our due diligence requirements to
manage accounts where the ownership and control of the business entity is
held outside of the ****UK****.****

 ****

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in
opening an account with Barclays Wealth Intermediaries and wish you every
success for the future.****
