​Nadya,

 

I've been trying to call Majid aka Majestic all day. I will try again tomorrow. I'm starting an e-mail ticket and will keep you in the loop.

 

 

Regards,

Nadya,

 

I see the reg for Majestic pending in our queue. Thanks for that. I also see steve@formationshouse.com​ - is that a colleague of yours?

​Nadya,

 

That's so strange I don't see it in my inbox or our support inboxes. Is it worth finding out which e-mail you sent it to?

 

 

Regards,

Nadya,

 

I'm going through docs now.

 

When you say you didn't a reply on this application yet, do you mean to say you had sent an e-mail about it already? Where did you send it and when? Last week I sent this on wednesday

 

I want to make sure your e-mails aren't slipping through the cracks somehow.

 

Also, if you haven't registered this client online yet, please do: https://secure.europacbank.com/register.php​

Ok will do

 

Lastly, is this the same client we've been talking about - the one that owns stocks that he may want to transfer over? No, a new one

 

 

Regards,
