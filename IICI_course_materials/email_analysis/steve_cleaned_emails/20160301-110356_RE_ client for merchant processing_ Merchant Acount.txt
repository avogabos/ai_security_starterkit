Hi 

An app isnâ€™t integrated with their website, it is entirely different and separated. 

3 different prices for the same product? How is that possible? 

money withdrawal is weekly. 

Regards

Few more queries from customer:


1. I will have 3 different prices for products. Is each product supported by its own checkout button?


2. I have clicked on the 30 day free trial button will your technical team integrate it onto my website?

When I click on trial period does this allow me to have the app integrated onto my website?



3. Regarding withdrawals of monies that customers pay is this available daily to put into my PayPal account or is it weekly?

Currently payment processing is only offered via our infiniApp Solution & not as a stand alone. 

you can offer the customer an infiniApp solution, this would require him uploading his products to our infiniApp solution. 

Regards

Darius
