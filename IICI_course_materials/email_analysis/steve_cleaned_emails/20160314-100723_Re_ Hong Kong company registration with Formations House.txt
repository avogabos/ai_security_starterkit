Hi Steve,

Thank you for your email.
Question: You said " If you also need bank account for Hong Kong company 
we can arrange that for GBP 500. Bank account will be processed with an 
offshore bank in St.Vincent Islands", How about we need Hongkong Bank 
account?is that possible?Ho much does it cost?

Best Regards,
