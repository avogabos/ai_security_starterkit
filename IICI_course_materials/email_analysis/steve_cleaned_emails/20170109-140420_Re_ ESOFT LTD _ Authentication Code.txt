Dear Steve,

Thank you for sending the information, but I'm still not able to login. I tried to enter the given Gateway ID and password to:

https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services

or

https://authenticate.gateway.gov.uk/sidp/SignIn.ashx?gwv=1.0&gwrealm=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gateway.gov.uk%2fmyaccount%2f2007%2f07&gwreply=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gateway.gov.uk%2fDefault.aspx&gwcategory=Org


and I have got a message saying invalid user id or password.


Another question please: after I have logged into the companies house website, I got 5 links to proceed with, which are:

Abbreviated accounts

Dormant company Accounts

Micro-entity Accounts

Full Accounts (with abbreviated option)

File company tax returns and accounts


which of these options I should use? It is possible to use the last option to use the joint filing account service?


Thank you

Regards,

Rana Risheh
