Dear Paul

I have got the documents for BVI company Golden Eagle Aviation Limited.

I need to forward this to our offshore service team for assessment which is a normal procedure which we have to complete, requesting few confirmations from the registry and calculation of cost including penalty payment and our service charges.

Due to holidays we are close on Friday and Monday, on Tuesday we will be contacting BVI registry and our agent for verifying certain information. We will request the concerns to reply us as soon as possible, however give us time till Wednesday 30th March 2016 to give you a complete update. After you can send in the required payment and due diligence documents from company directors and shareholders and then we will take over the company, assign our BVI agent and enter company in to our system under your existing customer id 8118443.

Your account manager is Ms. Sarah (sarah@formationshouse.com<mailto:sarah@formationshouse.com>) also recipient of this email. From Tuesday you can contact her directly on sales line 0044-207-01-2727 or by email.


Regards

Steve
