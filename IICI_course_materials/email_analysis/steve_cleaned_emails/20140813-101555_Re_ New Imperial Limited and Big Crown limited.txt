Dear Steve,

I hope that this email finds you well.

I believe that you my previous email regarding refund of fees for two 
Gambian companies, i.e. Big Crown Ltd and Next Imperial Ltd, have not 
reached you. Could you please confirm that the fees have been refunded 
to our clients account by Formation House?

Bets regards,
Andrei
