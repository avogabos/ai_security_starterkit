Hello to all the team,
Hello Steve,

I phoned on Wednesday morning to HMRC because I want they cancel the tax £ 602.04 and they make a remission of the taxe, or better, they cancel exceptionally tax.

I told them I did not know he had to warn them that Khadija KHOKHAR  has left the company on 5th Sep’15, and I asked them to excuse me.

They said he would do what I ask if the person doing the accounts of my company their phone, today or tomorrow before 19h.

I told them that since 20 December 2014 I have not issued any invoice and since this is my personal money I put into the company.

Thank you for your call to HMRC,

Regards,

Jean-Jacques Gomez.
