Dear Mr Smith

  

 Re - GLOBAL FOUR LIMITED - 09544950

  

 Companies House will require the following documents, with regards to the Administrative Restoration, of the above company. 

  

 1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site
 www.gov.uk). 

  

 2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors -
 https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

  

 3) Confirmation Statement form CS01, (including Parts 1-4, which should be completed accordingly) for the review period ending – 16/04/2017, with the filing fee of £40.

 The company was dissolved due to failure to file the statutory documents as and when they became due, in this case, the Confirmation statement for 16/04/2017 which should have been filed by 30/04/2017.

 Yours faithfully
