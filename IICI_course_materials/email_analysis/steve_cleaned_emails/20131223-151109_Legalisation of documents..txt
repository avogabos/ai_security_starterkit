Dear All

 

Please note that as our notary public is currently on annual leave, no
Apostille documents can be processed until January 2014.

 

The First batch of Apostille Document therefore will be processed on Fri 3rd
January 2014,

 

Should you need any such document then you will have to wait.

 

This situation affects both Standard & Express Service. (Please do not send
to nadya any orders until 1.1.2014)

 

Thanks, Tahir
