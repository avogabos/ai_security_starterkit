Dear Steve,


We just spoke with someone in your office regarding the opening of a bank account in the UK for the above-captioned company. Michael Miller is the sole director and shareholder of the company. The company will be used to fund the purchase of securities and real estate in the UK. This will not be an operational business (i.e. doing a business in the UK and having an office there). We have not been able to find a bank that can open this type of account for us, and look to you for your assistance and/or guidance. We understand that a second director may be needed to facilitate the opening of an account in the UK.


Any help you can provide would be appreciated.


Mr. Miller is in Leeds today, and would like to meet with a bank if possible to start the process.


Thanking you in advance for your urgent response.


Kind regards,

Bettina Albury
