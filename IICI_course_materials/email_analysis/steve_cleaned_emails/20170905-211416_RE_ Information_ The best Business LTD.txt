Hello Carolina

Sorry for replying late because I was looking in our mails if we received CT41G for your company but we have not received it yet. Therefore we have submitted the request again with corporation tax office.

The form you received is CT600 - the tax return form, which is to be filed with HMRC when submitting annual accounts to companies house. The filing date is 2 December 2018 for annual accounts and tax return upto 31 March 2018.

As soon as we receive the CT41G form I will email it to you.

If you require further information or assistance you can contact us by email.

Hi !
I have been receive the attached document, I want to know what is it??
Because the form requires tax information, and we don't have it because we don't receive the corporation tax letter! Could you advice us with that please!
We don't want to have penalties.
