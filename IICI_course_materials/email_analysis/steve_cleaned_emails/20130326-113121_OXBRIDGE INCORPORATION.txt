Dear Steve 
 
Further to my previous e-mail, Karim will now be in touch directly with the information that you require. 
 
Please would you be kind enough to confirm the company names that have been approved as available for incorporation, and would you kindly copy Karim Rajani in to this e-mail. 
 
We are looking to have everything incorporated at the earliest. 
 
Very Best Wishes
