First we will update records and then see what is the effect so till month
end don't raise any questions and it is only with you because you stay after
12 and as per our working hours no one will stay after 9 PM but as we know
you have customers who contacted you after this so adjusting your problem.
Your issue is related to tech ppl and when they sort this your attendance
will be correct.

Check out: 23:55

Extra Hours: 00:20

 

23rd May 2017

Check in : 14:35

Check out: 23:55

Lacking Hours: 01:05

 

For above reference see attachment and  can anyone make me understand this
calculation?

 

Also as Fahad said due to date change after 12 o clock there were some
issues with my attendance, so Sabir will fix and update, I think updating
has been done which has increased my lacking hours to 11:46 which till
yesterday were between 6-7 hours.

 

If I get pay cut as per current report situation that will be unjust and who
should be responsible for this lack of incompetence and injustice?????
