Hi

 

What is the Gambia company name whose bank account application is rejected ?

 

I don't think EuroPacBank ever rejected Gambia application introduced by us
for this reason.

 

What can we offer to Gambia companies now ? should we look for a new bank?

Hi Nadya,

 

Our compliance department informed me that we recently turned down an
account introduced by Formations House due to connections with The Gambia. I
wanted to note that the jurisdiction is currently on our list of prohibited
countries, thus not allowing us to place the account.

 

Do you have any questions about this restriction or would you like to
discuss?

 

Hope all is well, thanks Nadya.
