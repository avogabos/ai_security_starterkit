Dear Sir

company number:
08496838
company name:
FAST ALLIANCE LTD


Thank you for your recent e-mail concerning the restoration of the above company.  After checking our records i can confirm that the company was struck off the register and dissolved for the non filing of statutory documents.

Please note that if the above company is being restored to continue to trade the company can apply for an application for administrative restoration.

 A form RT01 is required with an administrative fee of £100 and all outstanding documents - accounts for the period ending   30/04/2014.   There are no late filing penalties outstanding as the first accounts were due for filing after the company was struck off the register.

 The registrar also requires  annual returns for the years  19/04/2014 and 19/04/2015   with filing fees of   £80

A Bona Vacantia waiver letter which can be obtained from the treasury solicitors website-https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1


Alternatively the company can apply to be restored by an order of court, all information on how to restore a company by this procedure can be found on-www.tsol.gov.uk. Please note that if the company is to be restored to trade all outstanding documents are also required to be filed.

If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact us

Your faithfully

Catherine Powell
