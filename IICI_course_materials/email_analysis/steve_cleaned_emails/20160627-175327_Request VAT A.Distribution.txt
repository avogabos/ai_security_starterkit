Dear Mr Steve,

I hope everything is well.

My account Italian Manager has requested VAT for our company
A.Distribution,but I think there were some mistaakes on form.Indeed I
received  anegative answer about.
I believe that our Account made a data entry error in form.


He sent the NIN of General Manager, Simonetta Stabile, and the detail of
Company's Director, Maria Stella Pistone.
As the General Manager, Simonetta Stabile, is the person who will take care
of English society , A.Distibution , and is also the only one that owns the
NIN :
- We can apply the VAT using the data even if the General Manager does not
appear on the Statute ?
-If not, Can we use the data of the Maria Stella Pistone, Director ,
replacing the NIN with the Number of European Healthcare Identification (
identification number to register )?

Thank you fo your time and patience

I look forward to hear from you very soon

Best Regards

Simonetta Stabile
