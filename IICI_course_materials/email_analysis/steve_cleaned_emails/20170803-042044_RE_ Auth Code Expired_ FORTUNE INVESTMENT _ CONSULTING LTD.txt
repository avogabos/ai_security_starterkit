Dear Customer,
This is to inform you that the authentication code for your company FORTUNE INVESTMENT & CONSULTING LTD has expired. We have requested Companies House for a new authentication code which will be sent to the registered office address of your company (Suite B, 29 Harley Street, London W1G 9QR). It takes approximately 5 working days for the authentication code to arrive to the registered office address.
It has been observed that you have placed 2 orders to file the Confirmation Statement for your company. Both the forms are pending with us.
- Order No. 193913 (Dated: 05-07-2017)
- Order No. 193922 (Dated: 07-07-2017)
Please confirm if the second order was placed unintentionally or intentionally. If the order has been place unintentionally we shall maintain a credit balance of 15 GBP for future use of services.
We await your confirmation in this regard. If you need any assistance, please feel free to contact us at
