Dear Sir

Re ? European Group Ltd - 5261868

If the above company is required on the Register, you can apply for it to be Administratively Restored.  To proceed with this process, Companies House will require the following documents:-
1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

3) Annual Return form for the year ending ?
31st October 2014, with the filing fee of £40.
 (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).

Please note the Annual Return form for the year ending 31st October 2015, will be due by 28th November 2015.

4) Accounts for the period ending -

31st October 2014.

Having checked our records, as the above company was struck of the Register, prior to filing the Accounts for 2014, no late filing penalty would been generated, upon its Restoration.

Yours faithfully

Mr A. Owen.

Restoration Department.
