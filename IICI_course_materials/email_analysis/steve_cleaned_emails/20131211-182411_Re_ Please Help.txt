Steve,

Alright. This seems easy way. Let me send you the authorization form along
with the front and back side scan of my card. Bank transfer seems to be
critical and lengthy process.

But, the new cards don't come with an ISSUE DATE. Though the bank letter
has a date when they issued the card. Shall I mention the same date?

If it is a VISA

You can either fill
the attach form and send it to us as scan copy with front and back of your card
and we will charge your card manually. Or you can make payment by bank
transfer.

Steve,
I once again tried to process my card but another attempt in
vain.
Mine is a VISA International Debit card. I'm selecting VISA
in the card type section. Is this where I'm going wrong? Do I need to select
DEBIT Card instead of Visa? But if I select Debit Card, it asks for ISSUE
NUMBER and My Card doesn't have one. No new cards have it I believe. I'm really
struck here.
I went to my bank today and they said there's loads of
formalities to transfer funds to UK as the rules have changed a lot for cross
border payments as per the Reserve Bank of India so there are many bank
formalities which seems time consuming.
I'm looking forward to your help as the formation is getting
delayed.
Regards,
Pratik Roy
