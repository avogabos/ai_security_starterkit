Good morning Steve,

Well.this company formation has been a mess.

First because of company name that has been not publicized from you.

And now that the company has been set up, the shareholders registry is not
working. Shares transferred under the old name {bank of Dakar} have
disappeared.

It is not possible now to have a list of shares for the shareholders

Everything is messed up

Is it possible to clean all the registries and start all over again.

Try to do your best my Dear.

Eric
