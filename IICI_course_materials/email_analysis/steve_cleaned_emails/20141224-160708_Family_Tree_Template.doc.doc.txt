Dear Steve,

Just landed just saw your email tried to make this as fast as possible so that they might at least give me a chance to explain in the appointment that they have nothing to worry about as far as the money market is concerned that they feel I will be involved in. 

I will act as a stockholder. I have the business plan ready for them to see you already have it. 

Please be kind enough to tell them that as least I should be given a change to explain before they drop my request. 

Thank you and have a Merry Xmas.

I hope you will be my Santa Claus this year with your reply...

Maria.
