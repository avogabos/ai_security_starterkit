Scottish Labour accused of U-turn on rebate plans

Scottish Labour has been accused of performing an “outrageous” U-turn after scrapping its plans for a £100 rebate for Scots earning under £20,000 a year. Party leader Kezia Dugdale announced the policy less than two months ago to protect low paid workers from income tax rises, but party sources said the £100 rebate was no longer needed due to the increase in the personal allowance announced in the UK Budget earlier this month. However, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon criticised the reversal, stating: “Instead of getting £100, the low paid are now having their personal allowance increase taken away by Labour.” Scottish Labour has also insisted that a proposal to increase the top rate of income tax to 50p is not "gesture politics" and could raise up to £110m towards closing the attainment gap in Scotland's schools.

HRMC splits up IT contract

HMRC has announced it will put out to tender about 200 small, flexible contracts for SMEs, valued up to £100m each. These will replace the Aspire IT contract that collects tax receipts from more than 30m people. HMRC says the move will save about £200m a year by 2020-21, but legal experts have questioned whether the Revenue has the skills to integrate more than 200 systems.

Tax dodge claim levelled at Northern Rock sale

The NAO is looking into claims that the US buyer of former Northern Rock mortgages sought to avoid UK tax. Cerberus Capital agreed to buy the £13bn loan book from the Government last year. But the Treasury Select Committee has raised concerns over the value of the sale after it emerged that the loans would be owned by a Cerberus affiliate based in the Netherlands.

Millions 'could be lost' if tax deal hits Welsh budget

Hundreds of millions could be lost if a deal on devolving tax disadvantages Wales, government finance expert Ed Poole has warned.

BSB to license Alternative Business Structures

The Legal Services Board has approved the Bar Standards Board's application to become a licensing authority for alternative business structures. "We welcome the LSB’s announcement that our application to become a licensing authority for ABS has been approved. It is testament to our desire to encourage innovation and competition and to improve access to justice within the legal services market," said Oliver Hanmer, director of supervision of the BSB. Last year saw the ICAEW grant its 100th ABS to Essex-based firm Tiffin Green.

Time to bridge the gender pay gap

Olivia Hill, chief HR officer of the AAT, writes to the Standard to highlight concerns that the gender pay gap is not closing quickly enough. The AAT has found that 51% of women working in finance in London know or suspect that men in their workplace who are doing the same job are paid more than them.

PROPERTY

 

Buyers rush to beat stamp duty change

Conveyancing solicitors have been swamped with clients demanding they complete house purchases ahead of the imposition of a stamp duty surcharge. From Friday, higher rates of stamp duty applying to buy-to-let will mean the bill on a £250,000 home will rise from £2,500 to £10,000. Estate agency Haart said activity in London had increased by 35% this week, with staff organising viewings at irregular hours and hand-delivering documents to push through last-minute transactions. Separately, the FT reports that prices for properties in London’s wealthiest areas have dropped 6.7% since their 2014 peak.

Average house price lower than previously thought

An overhaul of how the Office for National Statistics calculates house price figures is expected to show the average price of buying a house in the UK is lower than is currently believed. Early estimates have revealed that the difference could be as great as £37,000. The discrepancy has emerged following the ONS' use of a new mathematical formula to calculate the nation's average house price which gives less weighting to very high value properties. It suggests the average cost of a home in the period might have been £185,000 in England and Wales, compared with earlier estimates of £222,000.

FIRMS

 

Lawyer banned after billing clients for holidays

A lawyer and former partner in two leading London law firms has been banned from working in any British practice after charging clients for his own holidays. Konstantinos Adamantopolous was found to have billed personal expenses to clients after an investigation into his alleged misconduct was carried out in 2010 by KPMG on the instruction of Holman Fenwick Willan, where Mr Adamantopolous worked. The Solicitors Regulation Authority referred the case to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which has released its decision. Mr Adamantopolous had tried to argue that there was a conspiracy between Holman Fenwick Willan and KPMG but the tribunal rejected his theory as having "no merit whatsoever".

Prices fall as average hits £190,275

Latest Land Registry figures show that house prices in February fell by 0.2% month-on-month, a small correction after January’s 2% rise. This small drop took the average property value down to £190,275. This is 6.1% higher than a year earlier, but down slightly on the January figure of £191,812. The figures showed that annual price growth in London is running at 13.5%, more than double the national average, with the typical price of a property in the capital now £530,368.
