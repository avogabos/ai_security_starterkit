Hi Phil
Since you have not filed the company dissolution application,
you will need to submit company’s Annual Returns because they are now due today
(4
th
Dec-2014).
Also note that when you file company dissolution application,
company registrar take 6 months to close the company and during that period our
registered address will still be used for your company and it is already expired
since 15-July-2014.
Therefore we request you to renew the Registered Address and
file the Annual Returns.
Thank you.
Regards
Steve
