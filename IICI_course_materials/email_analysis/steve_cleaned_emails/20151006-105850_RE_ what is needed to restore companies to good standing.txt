Good Morning Steve, 
 
Thank you for your recent e-mails. I would be extremely grateful if you could kindly ask Companies House to expedite the Request to reinstate the Companies to good standing so that we can do this at the earliest. 
 
I would be most grateful if you could get back to us by tomorrow at latest. 
 
With Kindest Regards
