Hi Steve

Thanks for getting back to me. I did give them the downloaded certificate,
but this was not good enough.

I will send them the explanation you provided and hope this will be OK.

Regards
Chris

Hi Chris
Attach is the Certificate of Incorporation for Advanced Cloud
Solutions LLP. You can also download the copy from your account at our website,
under the UK Company Admin section.
If someone ask you to provide original, then you can mention
that company was registered online and the provided document is considered as
original, it can be verified by company registrar
www.companieshouse.gov.uk
Regarding proof of bank, I have forwarded the request to
relevant person, will update you as soon as I have the information.
Regards
Steve

Hi Steve
We are trying to finalise the registration of an office but
they need a couple of documents that I do not have.
1. The original Certificate of Incorporation so they can
take a copy. Can you tell me where this is?
2. Proof of a UK Bank Account. Apparently this is a new
requirement this year by the City Of London. I think Raj is waiting on another
letter from the Seychelles, before the account can be set up. Can you please
look into this ASAP
Many thanks
Chris
