Dear Sir

BLUE MASTERS LTD

Thank you for your e-mail dated 4 August 2014.

I can confirm that this company was struck off the register and dissolved because statutory documents remained outstanding despite a number of letters being issued to the company.  Therefore, the Registrar of Companies had no choice but to believe that this company was no longer required and to take the necessary action which led to the company being struck off the register.

I can confirm that the following documents and fees are required in order to apply for this company to be administratively restored to the register:

Form RT01.  This form must be accompanied by a filing fee of £100 and can be downloaded from our website.

Accounts for the period ending 31 December 2012.  These accounts will not incur late filing penalties as they became due after this company was struck off the register.

Annual Returns (forms AR01) for 9 December 2012 and 9 December 2013.  These forms must be accompanied by a filing fee of £40 per annual return and can also be downloaded from our website.

BV Waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors.  Guidance on how to obtain this letter can be found at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1 . There will be a cost of around £64.

You should also be aware that accounts for the period ending 31 December 2013 are due by 30 September 2014.  If this company is not restored to the register by the due date, then this document will also be required in order for the company to be restored.

I hope this information has been of some use to you.

Yours faithfully
C E Street (Ms)
