Dear Steve,

Sorry, that I am again sending e-mail.
We have  extremely a hurry to open the company to Scotland.
You need these documents from us (what else?):
If Corporate Entity:

1. Company Documents presenting beneficial owner name (Certificate of
Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles)
2. Proof of ID (Valid Passport) and Proof of Address (Last 3 months utility
bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card
statement.) of the beneficial owner of the Corporate body.(Please do not
send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)


If the documents are not in English then you need to have them translated
and notorized. And send original and translated copies.

Kind regards
Mira Luukkanen
