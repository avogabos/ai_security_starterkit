Hello,

 

I have a question about starting up a UK Ltd.

We are a project developer looking to raise funding for our new project.

We would like to start a company with 100 shares and then start selling these shares for €25000 and use that money to start building our project and then give the shareholders a yearly dividend payout

What are our possibilities for this, what is the best cost-effective way to do this ? Are there special regulations we need to follow for this kind of company?

We can choose the value (for example €1 per share) of the share during start-up and if we sell the shares, do we need to pay taxes on this on the more value ?

If we sell shares only to non-UK citizens or companies, do we still pay taxes on this in UK ? 

Can we use a ready made company and change the name with the term invest in it without any problems ?

I have read that bearer shares are no longer an option, is there any alternative ?

 

Thank you

 

Met vriendelijke groeten,

Best regards,
