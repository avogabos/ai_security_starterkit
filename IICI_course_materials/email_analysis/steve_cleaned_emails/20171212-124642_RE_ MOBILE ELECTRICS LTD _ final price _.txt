We cant open an offshrie using our director, its too hard to change it after
anyway.

He needs to either take it as is, (we can close the account) and then we can
attpempt to open an offshire but we cannot give a guarantee as its based on
him and the bank understanding his business

The price is too low, why doesn't he just take a normal RM if he doesn't
want a bank account.

Hi,

 

Client came back with increased offer of GBP 7000/-, do not want bank
account in UK because he cannot travel, has agreed if we can open offshore
bank account for the company. HE wants us to open bank account and then
transfer.

 

Is it possible and what will be the timeframe?
