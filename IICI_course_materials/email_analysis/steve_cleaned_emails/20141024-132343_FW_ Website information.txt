Dear Chris,
 
The company is indeed incorporated. The issues are CH has changed the LLP filing system, meaning we aren’t currently integrated as we were before, but it is being updated.
The surest way to check is to go to www.companieshouse.gov.uk and check here for the company.
 
Many Thanks
 
Charlotte

Hi Charlotte/Steve
 
When I logon to your website and look under LLP management I get this screen.
 

 
Can you please confirm that the LLP is incorporated and that your system needs updating.
 
Thanks
