Dear Steve I need to incorporate a Tust or a Foundation to control directly
Levra IV as I understand nominee shareholder are no more leagal.
I am divorcing and it's goind to be a long and painfulf process.
I woul like the structure to:

- be legal (I don't want to incurr in problem with UK company*)
- minimize taxation
- be cost effective

Can you please provide me some more information about structure and costs ?
* I fear a "Gambia Trust may sound bad to UK and Italian tax authorities
Grazie
