Dear Steve,

Did not you receive reference number of ATB CONSORTIUM yet?
Client asked me to write you about it. He wants pay the tax asap.

And i have got an email from your support team that
"We have received the activation pin code and have successfully enrolled
your company for Corporation Tax Online services. However, in your HMRC’s
online account, we have noticed that the status of your company is dormant
with HMRC, due to which we cannot submit the Corporation Tax Return. We
have sent a fax to HMRC regarding the same and will update you as soon as
we will receive a response from HMRC."

It was 8 days ago. Is there any news about status of company and submission
the Corporate tax
return?

Best wishes,
Ekaterina.
