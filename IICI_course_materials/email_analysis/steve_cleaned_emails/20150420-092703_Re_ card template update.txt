Dear Steve,

What can I say you are the greatest. I was checking the card and thank you for the addition of the address.

I will do the link you sent me right now but last thing for the cards and I will NOT bother you again with them but only with NEW services.

1. On the card where the fax number is placed pls remove the cell phone icon before if and place a FAX icon.
2. Kindly remove the info@mbcapitalventuresltd.com <mailto:info@mbcapitalventuresltd.com> sinceI have my own e-mail now and so do my colleagues.
3. Kindly PLACE my UK CELL phone in the place that is left vacant from the removal of the info email which is : + 44 20 7097 1844 

Please send it back to me as soon as you can there will be no more changes we have covered it all!

THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!!!!

In anticipation of your next mail with the corrections so that I can finnaly for to print… :-)

BEST REGARDS
