Dear Tim
 
Current director and shareholder for company EVENTUS CAPITAL PARTNERS LIMITED is Mr. Harmandar Singh Gupta.
 
 
For bank account if director and shareholder are 2 different persons then both of them will be required to be at bank.
 
 
Please confirm if you wish to go ahead with change in director.
 
 
Please note that if you wish to change shareholder also, then you will need to file company’s annual return which will take 15 working days to process and costs will be 15 GBP.
 
 
Also confirm after changes, do you need Apostille set of company documents with Certificate of Good Standing which will process in 15 working days after annual return process and will costs 265 GBP. And if you go for the express service, then these docs will be processed within 7 working days after annual return process and will costs 565 GBP.
 
 
Waiting for your advice.
 
 
Regards
 
Steve
