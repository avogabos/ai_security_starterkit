Hi Steve

I'm well thanks how are you?

Please form the company with me only as the sole director /member, using the standard sic for a limited by guarantee charity/non profitable organisation. Please disregard Icilfa Dodd and Maria McKellar.

The activities are: we are a non profitable organisation (charity) raising funds to do good for people around the world.

The guaranteer amount is £1

I shall retry payment although yesterday no invoice remained on the account so I assumed it went through? Please advise

Thanks

Bianca.

Hi Steve,



I created an account on line and the ID is 12637510.



I have attached the info requested.



It is a charity being formed so I do not think the SIC, activity, turnover questions apply here?



Payment by online card thank you.



Please let me know if anything is unsuitable with ID and address proof provided.



Please let me know if I have missed anything or made any errors.



Thanks,



Bianca
