Dear Steve

In previous email you mentioned about providing documents
-Scan of passport copy
-Proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR
electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.

I will be staying in Pakistan  for more than year and bills are on the
house owners. Is there any chance that photo copy of passport would work?

I only need to register name for late trading.

Regards

Ismail
