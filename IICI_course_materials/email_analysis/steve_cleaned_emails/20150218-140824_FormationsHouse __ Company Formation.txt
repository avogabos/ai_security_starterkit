Dear Mr Smith,

Good afternoon. Many thanks for your interest in our services.

I can confirm that we are in position to provide a one-stop-shop service including company formation and all legal, tax, accounting and back office support, virtual office or local serviced real office services required by international companies. To start off with, following please find some general information on using Malta companies in international tax planning:

Malta companies for international business operations:

A Maltese company can trade and provide services/consultancy/intermediation internationally throughout Europe (having a Maltese/EU VAT registration if necessary) as well as outside the EU, enjoying a net 5% effective tax rate after refunds to shareholders.  Maltese companies are not low tax companies (the corporate tax rate is 35%) but shareholders are entitled to claim a refund of the tax paid by the Maltese companies.

Malta companies for asset holding and asset protection:

A holding company is not strictly necessary but offers the advantages outlined below.
Typically, we would also recommend that structure to include a Maltese holding company that will:
•        act as the personal/group holding company
•        receive dividends and tax refunds on your behalf to avoid these being paid directly to you and therefore, to avoid or defer personal tax on dividends.
•        defer personal tax by avoiding distributions directly to shareholders;
•        re-invest or loan the dividends + tax refunds into the subsidiary company;
•        serve as a personal investment / holding company providing asset protection by owning any personal assets (luxury items, art, real estate, cars, yachts, jets, etc.)
•        serve as a group holding company holding business assets of any form (real estate anywhere, fixed assets, investments, securities, bank accounts, intellectual property, etc.)

Malta holding companies for tax planning:

Maltese holding companies are also excellent tax planning tools in that they enjoy low effective tax rate on worldwide profits as follows:
•        0% on dividends received from a participating holding, that is:
where the parent company holds at least 10% of the equity in the subsidiary; or
holds an investment in the subsidiary of at least € 1.5 million and holds that investment for more than 183 days).
•        0% on capital gains made from the disposal of a participating holding;
•        0% on royalties from Malta registered IP owned by the company.
•        5% on dividends from non-participating holdings;
•        5% on group finance / treasury income;
•        10% on passive income (interest, royalties, etc.)
•        10% on passive rental income (rent from investment properties where property trading/rental is not the commercial business of the company).

I am sending you below a summary of our intermediary rates:

Start-up (one-time costs):

Company Formation: € 855

Official Registry Fee: 245

Bank Accounts: € 250

VAT Registration: € 350

Annual Costs:

Annual Registry Fee: € 100

Accounting, VAT Compliance, Tax Returns: TBD as per level of activity.

Capital (in your company bank account): Minimum € 1,250 (20% paid up)

Optional:

Fiduciary Shareholding per UBO: € 650

Company Secretary: € 500

Local Company Directors: available on request.

Additional HoldCo: Domiciliation / Registry Fee: € 700 + 100

Start-up and first year costs and capital is payable on order.

An urgent formation services is available within 24 hours (+ € 500).
