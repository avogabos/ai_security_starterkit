Dear Ms Banakou,

My name is Elliot and I am the product manager for the virtual office telephone service we offer at Formations House.

The problem you’ve been experienced has been escalated to me and I would first of all like to apologise for the issue you’ve experienced to date.  Formations House has been undertaking a significant upgrade to our phone capabilities, which has required ‘porting’ (transferring) all our customers’ numbers to a new provider.  Unfortunately there have been technical difficulties during the porting process, which has frustratingly been out of our control and left a portion of our customers’ numbers unavailable for an extended period of time.  This is not a permanent issue, but we are yet to be informed when these numbers will be again available.

We are extremely grateful for your continued patience and would like to provide a solution as soon as possible.  We would be able to provide you with a new number immediately, with both phone and fax capability.  This number could be temporary until the issue is resolved with our provider, or be a new and permanent number for you.  In either instance, we are also offering you six months’ free phone and fax service, as a token of our gratitude for your continued patience.

I have performed a search of available numbers that closely match your existing virtual number and have found: 020 3870 2771 and 020 3872 2771.

 

I hope this solution is satisfactory to you.  If you could contact me at your earliest convenience to confirm your acceptance, and to indicate which new number you would prefer, I will endeavour to get your service restored as soon as possible.

 

With kind regards

 

Elliot Burke
