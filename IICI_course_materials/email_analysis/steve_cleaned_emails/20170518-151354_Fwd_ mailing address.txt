Dear Mr. Smith,

Thank you for your message.

I haven't received any confirmation as, I suppose, the webpage of your
company doesn't work properly. This email seems to be the only online way
to contact you as the other email or the form doesn't work either.

I don't have a passport and my national ID is outdated so I think the only
proof of ID I have is my EU Driving Licence (Polish). I have been resident
in the UK for several years and I can produce a recent bank statement with
my current residential address (from The Cooperative Bank).

I believe that a driving licence and a bank statement should be legally
acceptable for you but, please, confirm that it is so. It normally takes 6
months before I can get a new Polish passport from our embassy in London.

I plan to organise training courses here in Bournemouth and in London. I am
a licensed NLP Practitioner (I can produce a certificate, as well) and I
completed medical studies in Poland but do not practice medicine in the UK
and don't plan to register here as a doctor. I think that the turnover for
the current tax year from training courses will not exceed £20 000. If it
is very successful, however I will register a limited company and request a
registered address preferably in Harley Street, as well.

Please, do let me know if you can accept the above mentioned documents and,
if this is the case, I will send the copies via this email or by post.

I prefer to pay by a bank transfer because there is no SSL on your
website and I hesitate to send my card details via an unsecured link (no
padlock in the link address).

Thank you and I am looking forward to hearing from you,

Yours sincerely,

Artur Bartosik
