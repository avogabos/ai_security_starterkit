  This company will only hold shares in one other company.

How about we call it: SV Business Works Ltd

Thank you,

    Hi Scott

'Holdings' or 'Holding' are considered same and using the word you need to fulfill the requirement to provide a justification letter for HOLDINGS or HOLDING showing two or more existing company names and percentage of shares that ‘HOLDINGS’ company will hold of these subsidiaries. 

You can update me on this issue asap. Meanwhile I am forwading documents to relevant department for review.

Waiting for your reply.

Regards
