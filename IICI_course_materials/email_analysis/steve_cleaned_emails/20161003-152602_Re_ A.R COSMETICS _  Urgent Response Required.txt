Hi Steve

Sorry for the confusion.
My share would be 100 so it would be better to change it to 100 at least for your records.

If you wish I can submit the allocation request with company registrar and within 2 working days these share will be allocated to you and share certificate will be issued. However information on these 50 shares will not be available on FORM IN01 because these are being allocated after company formation.

Hi
Rozina
We
made the changes in your application exactly as it was state in your email.
As
per your instruction we removed to
Mr
Azad Majid but there were no instructions about the shares therefore they were
left unallocated. If you wish I can submit the allocation request with company
registrar and within 2 working days these share will be allocated to you and
share certificate will be issued. However information on these 50 shares will
not be available on FORM IN01 because these are being allocated after company formation.
Please
confirm if you wish for me to go ahead with share allocation application to
company registrar.

Dear Rozina
Thank you for completing due diligence.
We were submitting the application but came across one more
issue, that is of company’s registered address. You have mentioned Registered
Address as:
18 Riglands Gate
Renfrew
PA4 8NZ
Which is a Scotland address and region selected for company
registration is England and Wales.
Please confirm:
- If you wish to register company in region SCOTLAND, so that we
can region to Scotland and use the address which you have provided.
OR
- If you wish to register company in region England and Wales
then either provide Registered Address in England and Wales or you use our
Registered Address service for GBP 25.
Please provide confirmation for above as soon as possible so
that we can further proceed with your application.
Regards
Steve…
