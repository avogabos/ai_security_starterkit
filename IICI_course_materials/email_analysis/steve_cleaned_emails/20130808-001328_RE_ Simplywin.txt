Dear Sunil


Unfortunately your company registration request has been rejected due to
following reason:

"There is online gambling legislation enacted in Seychelles (Interactive
Gambling Act 2003), however, we understand that at present the Seychelles
Authorities are not entertaining internet gambling license applications and
it is therefore prohibited for Seychelles companies to carry on online
casino activities from Seychelles."


Please confirm we can change company registration and bank account
jurisdiction to Gambia.


Regards

Steve
