Hello,

passage in your email:
Scan color copies of following documents are required for company
beneficial owner/director/s and shareholder/s.
1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR

...What I'm wanting to do is establish an entity in another
country, a country other than the U.S., with its banking in another country
with bank secrecy as well.
The underlying purpose is strict business and personal privacy and
security. The entity is simply needed in order to hold or own a brand
name/trademark, combined with private banking to be able to process purchase
orders and process funds in general to fulfill said orders, pay suppliers (one
in U.S.), the product producer (located in China), etc. None of this is
possible in the U.S. - there's no privacy or property rights really, anymore.
The owner of the entity is actually based in the U.S., looking for this
solution. It appears that the passage highlighted above would defeat this
entire objective - this could all just be done in the U.S., with the same
results.
Would a trust setup work, to hold the brand name and be the legal
business entity that can have banking, in a country with banking secrecy, and
conduct business transactions, as described? If so, if understood correctly,
the U.S. person would need to have a person that could act as the Trustee -
