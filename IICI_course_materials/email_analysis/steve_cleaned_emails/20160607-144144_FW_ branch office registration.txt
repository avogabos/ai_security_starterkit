A Branch is possible, but the process takes longer. Hence why we suggested
doing it as a new company and making it a subsidiary later on

A branch incorporation will cost more, we charge £250 as its a different
form and from experience requires us to chase it in Companies House. They
also require a set of legalised documents for the existing Canadian company

 

Our advice therefore was based on speed and cost

I also would like to understand why, in your opinion (which I respect) a
separate entity has to be incorporated. According to Companies House website
the registration of an overseas company is legal, and because it is Canada
which is involved there is no dual taxation.

I found your details at Companies House and think that you probably are the 
company most likely to give me the info I need. This is about a Canadian 
company, incorporated in Victoria on Vancouver Island (British Columbia)
some 
years ago. For various personal reasons, it has remained dormant ever since.
I 
am its only shareholder. My query is as follows:

 

 

1)     Would you be in a position to register a branch of it at Companies
House 
in London in spite of the fact that there is no head-office in Canada as 
yet? In the affirmative what would the cost be?

Would be easier to incorporate a new company with the same name if possible,
and later point shres in the company to the BC company

 

 

2) Could you be its registered address, in charge of all documents required 
by Companies House etc...? I do not want to get involved in all this 
paperwork.

 

 

3) It has a legal name duly registered by my solicitor there, but no 
trading name. I want the UK branch to have a trading name (different from
the 
company name). Does my Canadian solicitor need to have the registration
modified 
or can I go ahead and give a trading name here in the UK. Will it be legally

protected?

This is answered by 1. It can be anyname thats available

 

4) The company shall be a small e-commerce selling all kinds of jewellery 
and related items.

 

 

5) Can a company legally have a virtual address? In the affirmative, what 
would such an address provided by your company cost?

 

 

6) You also provide mail forwarding. What kind of mail do you handle?

 

 

These are my main preoccupations at this point in time. I would be most 
grateful if you would kindly answer them.
