Hi Steve

 

Just for clarification, this is what Aleks I and understood would happen.

 

1. Gatex would be formed with Aleks as shareholder (OK)

2. MC Capital would be formed with Anthony Cowlam as shareholder (OK)

3. Advanced Cloud Solutions LLP would be formed with Gatex and MC Capital as
partners, Alex and Anthony as 'directors' (OK)

4. Set up one off shore bank account owned by both Gatex/MC Capital -
Aleks/Anthony as signatories (advice please) - either they each have an
offshore account or you get one account for one company and once opened you
add the other director as a shareholder and signatory.

5. Set up one UK Bank Account for Advanced Cloud Solutions - Aleks/Anthony
as signatories (OK) - LLP will be formed with RBS - will arrange an
appointment when convenient for both members to attend the bank.

6. Once this is setup, transfer MC Capital to Chris (advice please) yes, we
can do this,

7. Make Chris signatory for the one Off Shore Bank account (advice
please)once shares in MC capital transferred the bank mandate can be updated

8. Make Chris signatory for Advanced Cloud Solutions. (advice please)- again
once the account is open, and a few months have passed, the bank mandate can
be updated.

 

If having one off shore bank account does not work, then we can review this
structure.

 

 

Many thanks

Chris
