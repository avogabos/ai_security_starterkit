Dear Steve,

The documents or mr Weizmann are connected to mathlabtechnologies 
Which was incorporated with you.
I don't remember if he has any signature authorization in hashp.
Regarding the set - if the bank of belize don't need it - so we don't need it at this time.

Another thing - I asked the registration agent to send a signed registrar of shareholders & directors for hashp and pioche. If they contact you please tell them I need the same for mathlabtechnologies limited.

Best,
Ronny
