Steve, let CFI help you to step up all your company formation and
company secretarial requirements to far higher levels of profits and activities 
for you in 2016
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For starters, here's something very useful you should know at the very start of 
2016, Steve
Seven short months ago...
... upon the commencement of the Companies Act, 2014, last June 1st 2015, there 
was an 18 Month 'Transition Period' provided to December 2016, during which Directors
of existing private companies limited by shares have to decide on which form they
wish their company to take in the future:  i.e. either LTD (Private Company Limited
by Shares) or DAC (Designated Activity Company).
There are now only 11 months of this hugely important decision time left!
Enclosed is a summary information sheet which you are welcome to use to refresh 
your mind about what has happened and what may be expected of you over the coming
months.
It's worth a quick read. And if we can help you in this matter in any way, please
don't hesitate to contact myself or any of my colleagues in CFI.
Finally, let me promise you that - for the rest of this year and far beyond - if
 ever you need us, you are always GUARANTEED a super service from all your friends
at CFI.
After all, you deserve it.
Best wishes from all of us.

Don't forget, Steve

... that the same Companies Act 2014, introduced a new procedure for companies who
have missed, or know they will miss, their annual return filing deadline in the 
CRO.
To help you keep fully on top of these new procedures we have prepared a useful 
Q & A sheet to instantly answer key questions like this for you:

1. How does the process work?
2. What explanations will the Court accept for missing my Annual Return filing deadline?
3. Is there a guarantee that the application will be successful?
4. Will the extension of the time to file change my Annual Return Date?
5. How long after the company has missed its deadline can it get an extension?
6. My company is strike-off listed, will I still be able to make an application?
7. My company has been struck-off, can I still make an application to extend my 
time for filing?
