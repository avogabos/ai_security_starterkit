By way of summary, please note that a Malta company (‘MaltaCo’) is taxed at the flat rate of 35%. However, by virtue of Malta’s full imputation and refundable tax credit systems, shareholders (residents and non-residents alike) in receipt of net dividends from MaltaCo are generally entitled to refunds of Malta tax suffered at the level of MaltaCo. Such refunds typically reduce the combined overall Malta effective tax rate applicable in respect of profits derived by MaltaCo from 35% to between 0% and 6.25%. Attached please find an information document setting out the salient features of corporate taxation in Malta (CSB GRP – Malta’s Tax System.pdf) 

The minimum share capital for a Maltese private company is EUR 1,200.00 of which a minimum of 20% must be paid-up and in cases where fiduciary services are provided, the share capital must be fully paid-up. The time-frame for the incorporation of a Maltese company is approximately 2 / 3 working days from the date of receipt of all signed documentation, remittance of capital and settlement of all fees. The following link provides further corporate information -   <http://www.csbgroup.com/EN/content/12/Incorporation_of_a_Malta_Company> http://www.csbgroup.com/EN/content/12/Incorporation_of_a_Malta_Company
