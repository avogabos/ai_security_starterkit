Dear Alfredo Barbaranelli


Thank you for your email.


Please note that it is necessary to purchase 'Extreme Accounting' service because your Annual Accounts filing is overdue and can not be process under basic Dormant Accounts Filing service.


Please purchase and make payment for Extreme Accounting service as soon as possible to avoid penalties.


When placing the order, please select payment option as to pay by cheque or bank transfer. Then send me the order number so that I can fix the invoice amount from 500 GBP to 425 GBP to adjust 75 GBP DCA payment.


Once I fix the invoice I will email you and then you can make the payment by credit card.


Waiting for your reply.


Regards,

Steve Smith
