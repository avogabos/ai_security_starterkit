Dear Steve,

The business is still not clear. For what exactly the account will be used? In case the company will trade, we will need to know the exact names of suppliers and names of clients. In case the company will trade through website, we will need the address of the website and the name of the payment processor that will be used.
Please note that the client indicated that he would like to use merchant account services in the future. Please inform the client that we do not open merchant accounts for Seychelles companies.

Kind Regards,
Viktors Rafalsons
