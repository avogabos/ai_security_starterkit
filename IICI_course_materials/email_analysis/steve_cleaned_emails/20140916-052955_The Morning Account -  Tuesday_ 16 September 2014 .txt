Tax for the rich now the norm in the South East
The Daily Telegraph notes that the average price of a home in the South East now exceeds £325,000, bringing inheritance tax to ordinary bereaved taxpayers. The IHT threshold has been frozen at £325,000 since April 2009 with George Osborne ruling out a rise in the threshold until 2018. The Conservatives blame the Lib Dems for blocking a manifesto pledge in 2010 to raise it to £1m. The Treasury expects its revenues to increase from £3.5bn last year to £5.8bn by the end of the decade, writes Matthew Holehouse. Jonathan Isaby, the chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance group, said: "The Treasury is using fiscal drag as an increasingly painful method of raising extra revenue. It is stealthy and fundamentally dishonest. Hardworking people should be rewarded, not treated as cash cows to be milked." The paper’s editorial deems IHT unjust and calls for reform of both IT and stamp duty.

Politicians called on to reform business rates
Over 100 companies including Tesco, Marks & Spencer and General Motors have signed an open letter calling for business rates to be overhauled describing them as "no longer fit for purpose for the 21st century". The letter states: "Business rates are higher than property taxes anywhere else in Europe and are the second highest in the OECD. This is a critical problem for all of British business." It adds that a reformed system would generate improved investment and employment opportunities in local communities. "It is no longer an option to say that reform is too difficult or complicated and we call on all political parties to commit to fundamental reform in their manifestos for the next general election."

Phoenix in the spotlight
The Times’ Alexi Mostrous follows up on details of Phoenix Film Partners’ investors, one of whom was Geoffrey Cox, QC. Other high-profile figures listed as investors in the alleged tax avoidance scheme are Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, former BBC chairman Lord Grade and Vodafone director Sir Crispin Davis. In May last year, Mr Monstrous writes, HMRC wrote to Phoenix investors rejecting their claims for tax relief. "HMRC has concerns over how Phoenix could be said to have capital contributions from ordinary members totalling £1.2bn, when the whole of that amount was said to derive from an Ingenious-associated entity that did not have the financial backing of its bankers to fund that amount," the letter said.

Risks of local tax powers
Polly Toynbee examines the prospect of devolved powers to English councils in the Guardian, suggesting that localism would prove to be no panacea for social democrats. Ms Toynbee notes how some Labour councils have not used local tax-raising powers to increase council tax while, should further powers be given to councils, Conservative-run authorities might choose to cut local income tax.

FIRMS

Auditor fined over Worthington Nicholls
The Financial Reporting Council has fined HWCA £225,000 over 37 allegations of misconduct relating to the audit of financial statements of Worthington Nicholls in 2005 and 2006. HWCA, which later changed its name to Sixonethreeone (6131), entered a voluntary arrangement with creditors in 2010. Its former directors and successor firms, chiefly practices that are part of Haines Watts group, are liable for the fine plus £225,000 in costs. Paul Newsham, the managing director of Haines Watts’ Preston practice, who was lead auditor for Worthington Nicholls, was found to have conducted himself “significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected” by a member of the ICAEW and was barred from practising as a chartered account for three years. Paul George, head of conduct at the FRC, said: “It is essential that investors in smaller listed and Aim companies are able to rely upon the audited accounts of such companies in informing their investment decisions.” In a statement, Haines Watts emphasised that: “The fine has been levied against Sixonethreeone Limited not the wider Haines Watts group.”

PwC appointed administrator to collapsed Phones 4U
A blame game has begun over the collapse of Phones 4U which threatens the jobs of almost 6,000 staff in 550 stores across the UK. PwC has been appointed administrator to the group. Founder John Caudwell pointed to mobile operators for pulling their contracts with the firm while others looked at private equity owner BC Partners, who were accused of hamstringing Phones 4U’s bargaining ability by loading the firm with £200m in debt which it then took as a special dividend. Begbies Traynor partner Julie Palmer said: "It was never going to be a long-term investment."

INDUSTRY

Takeover Panel strengthens merger oversight
The Takeover Panel has begun a consultation on new rules that would make it easier to hold companies to account when they take over firms with promises of job security or other commitments. Rules would allow bid targets to draw binding commitments from the other firm. The panel said the changes would give it the right to bring in an outside agency, such as an accountancy firm, to ensure compliance and would have the power to block a merger if it believed the new owner was at risk of reneging on its promises. The move follows Pfizer’s failed attempt to buy Astra-Zeneca with the promise of investing in its research facilities.

Investigations into financial crime increase
Investigations by the City of London Police into financial crime have increased by 5%, according to Pinsent Masons, which said that the police force launched 544 investigations in the past year, compared to 517 in the previous year. However, the figure was still 31% lower than the recent peak of 792 investigations in 2011/12. The amount of cases being reported to all authorities nearly doubled in the last year to more than 230,000. Pinsent Masons said cuts had placed a huge pressure on the City of London police and these were seriously limiting its ability to open new investigations.

SMEs

Inside Lloyds’ rate-swap tactics
A former employee of Lloyds Bank has blown the whistle on how staff were persuaded to sell interest rate swaps to small businesses or risk losing their jobs. The complex financial contracts were meant to insure against interest rate rises, but as rates fell SMEs across the UK were trapped with expensive contracts that they do not understand, writes James Salmon. The whistleblower, James Ducker, said staff were encouraged to be vague about penalties and that the compliance department was nicknamed the Deal Prevention Office and “was seen as an irritating impediment to getting deals done.”

Amazon in Indian tax dispute
Amazon is facing regulatory hurdles in India as the state of Karnataka disputes tax paid on goods sold by third-party merchants. Analysts say online retailers are coming under increasing pressure from Indian tax authorities.

ECONOMY

Household debt blamed for depth of recession
New research from the Bank of England suggests that the recession was the deepest and longest in post-war history because households were so heavily indebted going into the crisis. Bank researchers said that an analysis of "microdata" on UK households' finances shows that those with high levels of debt in 2008 cut their spending by more, relative to their incomes, than others. And because gross household debt reached a historic high of around 160% of combined incomes in 2007, these spending cutbacks had a profoundly negative impact on demand when the downturn came. This debt overhang increased the depth of the recession and made it much longer than previous ones.

London needs to pitch to the world
Writing in the Standard, Michael Hayman warns that despite London’s reputation it still needs to be promoted to stay at the top of the world’s most influential cities list. Mr Hayman cites PwC’s Cities of Opportunity Index which lists London as the world leader in terms of economic influence, technology access, reputation as an urban gateway, and its development and design capabilities. “The capital needs a major push in its marketing to underline its importance to the UK and lay out its stall to the world,” writes Mr Hayman.

“Lifelong troublemaker” on influential list
Campaigner Charmian Gooch, who describes herself as a "lifelong troublemaker", was today named one of the world's most influential people. Ms Gooch is the founder of anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness and is currently campaigning to end the use of anonymous "shell" companies by dictators and criminals to hide their assets around the world. Ms Gooch said: "Anonymous companies are not in and of themselves the crime, they are the getaway car. Whether it's big polluters or tax avoiders or corrupt politicians, they all use this vehicle. This is a massive failure of our financial system that's happening right under our noses.”
