FSA regulation is for anyone conducting/ promoting financial based services
in the UK. It does not matter where the company is based. 

 

I do not believe there is a specific regulatory body for Seychelles but this
is not relevant if he is selling the service in the UK

Hello

Thank you for your reply to my last email.

As per my knowledge, I heard that FSA is a regulation for UK based
companies, As i am looking for Seychelles registration.
Do we have FSA regulation in Seychelles as well ?

Apart from FSA regulation is here any other reuglatory boday throgh which
you can help me to get the offshore company financial activity license as
18000 GBP is quite huge amount for me in initial start of a new business.
I hope you can undestand and help me.

Thank you
