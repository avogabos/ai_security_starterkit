Dear Steve,
the company was disolved because no annual return was made, so I hope that might be no big problem. It's an account for a dormant company anyway.
The SIC Code of  Pro6 Ltd was 63990.
2- 4 days will be very fine to get you response, I will check how we can go on in the best way.
By the way do you offer only business locations & company service?
For instance, we got requests for Namecahnge Deed Poll and the rewrite of the drivers licence to the changed Deed poll name, living address and more.
If you are interested we like to inform our customers. I remember that your Website was ery interesting for more than only founding a limited.
Feel free to response whenever you like and take my personal gratitude for yor support.
All the best
Nadine
PS: The Max Best Company is not important at the moment, maybe we could do the recover the old Ltd. first with the paid money?

RE: RE: Re: Payment due
Dear
Nadine
Company names ‘PRO 6’ and ‘PRO6’ are provisionally available for registration and we can use the name for MAX BEST. Also if you wish, you can apply to restore the dissolve company. Let me know if you are interested in restoration of dissolve company, we will then arrange quote for it.
Note that restoration is expensive then registering a new company. Restoration will give you the old company number, you will need to provide proof of id and proof of address of last director/s who were in the company when company was dissolved.
For SIC codes you can submit up to 4 codes at one time. We are not in position to advice on SIC Codes, you need to choose codes which suits best for company’s business activity.
Please advice on above as how you wish to proceed.
Regards
Steve….

Dear Steve,
thanks a lot for your quick reply.
I hope, that the most important thing may be still possible. The name should be Pro 6 or
Pro6 Ltd.
Maybe you are able to help me a little bit more. We, the US MC-Pro LLC already had the above named Company, which was dissolved in 2014,
Company 5881307.
Will it be possible to reactivate it without any problems?
Which documents will be needed of the US company as director?
Are my personal documents all you need?
For the SIC Code, you are talking about this:
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455263/SIC_codes_V2.pdf
?
The company does sercvices like consulting and support.
For instance: A house with 10 rooms will be hired and the rooms are letting in 3 pieces 3 rooms. The last room maybe our office. All in all this will be a dormant company of extraterritorial organisations.
I guess SIC 9999, 99000 or maybe 82990, but if possible let's hold it as open as possible.
Of course I need your feedback and have to check, how we arrange it the best way.
If you do have hintful tips, feel free to give advices.
Thank you very much in advance for your help.
All the best
Nadine
