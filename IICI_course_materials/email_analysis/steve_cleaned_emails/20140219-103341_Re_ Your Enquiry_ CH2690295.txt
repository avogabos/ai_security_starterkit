Dear Sir

Re: ALKOON TRADING LIMITED  No. 7500027

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file the following documents, fees and late filing penalties:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual returns for 20 January 2012, 2013 and 2014, with a filing fee of £40.00 per form.

3) Accounts for the periods ending 31 January 2012 and 2013. There are no late filing penalties for these accounts as they became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

4) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered online at http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/bvc14-administrative-restoration.aspx.

Yours faithfully

Andrew Lear
