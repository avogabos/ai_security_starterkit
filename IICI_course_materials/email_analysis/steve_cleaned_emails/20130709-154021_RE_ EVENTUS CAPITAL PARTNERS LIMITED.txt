Dear Tim

 

Current
director and shareholder for company EVENTUS CAPITAL PARTNERS LIMITED is Mr. Harmandar Singh Gupta.

 

 

For bank
account if director and shareholder are 2 different persons then both of them
will be required to be at bank.

 

 

Please
confirm if you wish to go ahead with change in director.

 

 

Please note
that if you wish to change shareholder also, then you will need to file company’s
annual return which will take 15 working days to process and costs will be 15
GBP.

 

 

Also
confirm after changes, do you need Apostille set of company documents with
Certificate of Good Standing which will process in 15 working days after annual

then these docs will be processed within 7 working days after annual return
process and will costs 565 GBP.

 

 

Waiting for
your advice.

Directorship and appoint KARIM RAJANI, you have all his id. Once done, please
forward me all the papers for the purposes of opening the bank accounts, this
is very important. If there is a charge please apply this to Karim's credit
