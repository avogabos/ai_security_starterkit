Hi Bruce Barton,



Thank you for your email.



Please note that we cannot use the document ‘water bill’ provided as proof of address because it is older than 3 months. The document is dated 06-September-2016 and we need document which must not be older than 3 months, also that document image was blur and it gets bit difficult to read. Therefore please arrange a clear copy of any of the documents mentioned below:



Proof of Residential Address : - Dated within last 3 months utility bill (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (issue date, name, address and account number must be visible).



Please provide above mentioned document as soon as possible so that we can further proceed with your application.
