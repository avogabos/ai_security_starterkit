Hi,

I think I was not able make it clear as what is required, please see the attach as an example for better understanding.

It is a standard for every passport in the world that all pages in the passport have the passport number punched on it, just like you can see the 'E' in the attach file. SO what we require is that in one image we can see the signature page and page next to signature page. Please provide as soon as possible. If you need further explanation then let me know.

Also we need your  updated and valid documents as following:

- VALID PASSPORT with picture page and SIGNATURE PAGE + page next to signature page in one picture.
- PROOF of RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS - dates within LAST 3 MONTHS utility bills
(water OR gas OR electricity or latest personal bank/credit card statement.
(issue date, name, address and account number must be visible).
- MLR (Money Laundering Regulation) registration certificate if available.

Regards

Steve...
