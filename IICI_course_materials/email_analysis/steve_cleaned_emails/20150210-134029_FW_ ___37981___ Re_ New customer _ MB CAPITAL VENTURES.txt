Hi Nadya, 

 

Thanks for the referral, I'm a colleague of Vincent's and will be handling the application, pleasure to meet you.

 

We're still waiting to hear back from you on whether we have the okay to contact the client directly, then after we reach him we can let you know the status of the pre-approval. I’ll look forward to hearing back from you and have a great weekend.

 

Best Regards,

Hi Nadya,

 

Nice to hear from you again and thanks for getting the pre-approval.

 

This application is borderline yes/no because we don't set up accounts for the purpose of doing pass-through transactions, and it looks like the purpose of this client's account with us is to wire money to buy an asset.

 

However, we may be able to work with them if it's mutually beneficial.

 

Can you give us permission to contact the client and learn more about her?

 

Lastly, please send the documents into accounts@europacbank.com <mailto:accounts@europacbank.com>  so I can assign the case to one of my associates. Thanks!

 

 

Regards,
