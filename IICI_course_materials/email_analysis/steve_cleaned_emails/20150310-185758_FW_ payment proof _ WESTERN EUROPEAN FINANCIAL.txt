Hello Denise,

 

Could you please check this payment again; customer has made payment in Euro
693.00 to our HSBC account for the order no. 181316 (WESTERN EUROPEAN

I cannot find this payment anywhere on our statements plus we contacted the
client and he has confirmed that the payment has been successfully
transferred.

 

Please advise

Many thanks.

Rachel

We have been trying to locate this payment (attached pay proof) but
unsuccessful.

 

I asked customer to check with his bank and bank confirmed that payment has
been transferred.

 

Please check again. Thank you.
