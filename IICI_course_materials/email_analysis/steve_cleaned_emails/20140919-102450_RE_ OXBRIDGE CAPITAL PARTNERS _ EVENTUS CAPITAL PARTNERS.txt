Good Morning Steve, your quotation of £420 is  perfectly acceptable. I am authorised to use a Company Credit card belonging to Mr Rajani senior. In the interests of time, could you kindly accept payment over the telephone ?

Dear Steve 
 
I hope that you are well. I am just in the process of finalising bank accounts for Oxbridge and Eventus, (Argentum I have all the papers), however, I do not seem to have copies of the documents that you sent Karim which are now required in order to open Bank accounts. Could you kindly email copies of all of  these to me as a matter of urgency,
 
Thank You, Tim
