Accountants’ recovery fees questioned
Mark Leftly cites figures that show some enforcement receivers are charging the Crown Prosecution Service £260 to £600 an hour to recover criminals' ill-gotten gains in the Independent. He says that even with a typical discount of one-third they are still charging nearly three times as much as a QC. The figures relate to a charge sheet by Grant Thornton but the CPS chooses from a roster of 12 accountancy firms which bid against each other for individual receiverships. Tony Cross, the Criminal Bar Association's chairman, said: "Perhaps it's a rather sad sign of the times that a senior accountant can be paid around three times more for dealing with the monetary aspect of a case than a top QC for prosecuting the most serious sexual and terrorist offences." A spokeswoman for Grant Thornton said: "Fees that are negotiated under a framework agreement are by their nature confidential. In all cases where a receiver has been appointed, and costs have been incurred, these costs are subject to the scrutiny of the court with anything deemed unreasonable disallowed."

Spreadsheet errors hit 16% of large companies
Research from F1F9, which provides financial modelling and business forecasting to blue-chip firms, shows errors in spreadsheets are creating financial losses for one in five large businesses. The firms’ new white paper, Capitalism's Dirty Secret, details how spreadsheets are used in the preparation of British company accounts worth up to £1.9trn and the UK manufacturing sector uses spreadsheets to make pricing decisions for up to £170bn worth of business. The report warns that 16% of large companies admitted finding inaccurate information in spreadsheets more than 10 times in 2014 while 33% of large businesses report poor decision-making as a result of spreadsheet problems.

Tougher laws required to curb rogue directors
Matt Henderson, head of restructuring at Johnston Carmichael, is calling for tougher laws to curb rogue directors, claiming the Company Directors Disqualification Act needs new powers to compel directors to co-operate with insolvency practitioners. "It's not possible to quantify the seriousness of any offences if a director does not co-operate with an insolvency practitioner and there are no funds left to fund a formal examination of a director's conduct,” he said.

Cameron: Miliband will cut your pay
David Cameron outlines his plan for election victory in an interview with the Telegraph. On taxes, Mr Cameron reiterates the Conservatives’ desire to raise the threshold for the 40p tax rate, into which he says too many middle-income families are being dragged, and warns that Labour would put up taxes by £3,000 per working family over the next Parliament. Meanwhile, George Osborne has pointed to House of Commons Library research which reveals Labour increased taxes by £2,000 for working families when they were last in Government. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday claimed the Conservatives plan to raise VAT to 22% and repeated a Labour pledge not to raise VAT, income tax or National Insurance. However, he has refused to rule out threshold freezes that could pull more people into higher bands.

Cadbury hit with $92m tax bill in India
Cadbury is contesting a $92m tax bill from the Indian authorities who allege the confectioner claimed excise benefits on a “phantom” factory in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. “This dispute is about whether Cadbury provided accurate records to claim this particular benefit, but it is part of a bigger problem,” said Dinesh Kanabar, founder of Mumbai-based consultants Dhruva Tax Advisors. “Foreign and Indian companies run into huge problems with the tax office over things like offers of tax holidays. Practically every time they ask for a benefit that they are due, the authorities find 100 reasons or glitches to say that it isn't due,” he added. The FT examines in detail the tax structures used by Cadbury’s in the run-up to its acquisition by Kraft three years ago, noting that its previous aggressive avoidance tactics meant the shift of Cadbury’s management to Switzerland by Kraft saw HMRC lose little from the deal in the end.

Southern European banks face deferred tax assets probe
The European Commission is considering whether to investigate southern European banks over the use of so-called deferred tax assets to bolster their capital. Athens says deferred tax assets represent some 30-40% of the core tier one capital in the country's main banks. Deferred tax assets are not considered “high quality” by the ECB and Brussels will determine whether a full investigation into the legality of the underwriting of banks using deferred tax assets by governments in Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy is required following an initial probe.

NatWest supports KPMG’s start-up partnership
KPMG has joined forces with business accelerator Entrepreneurial Spark to help start-ups prepare for investment and to help drive the business accelerator’s expansion from its current bases in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Ayrshire and Birmingham into the rest of the UK. NatWest is helping Entrepreneurial Spark create new “hatcheries” in its branches and will contribute cash towards start-up prizes while KPMG will give new businesses 1,000 free hours of support over the next three years with entrepreneurs also given access to KPMG's proprietary accounting service. Iain Moffatt, head of enterprise for KPMG, said: "Entrepreneurial Spark is working with the big businesses of tomorrow, so the more we can do to help entrepreneurs understand and get to grips with their numbers, and ultimately help them secure investment, the better."

Recession-borne SMEs entering golden age
A report written by the PM’s enterprise adviser, Lord Young, shows there are now 5m established small firms in the UK, an increase of 760,000 compared to 2010 with the number of new businesses created across the country hitting a record high in 2014 - 581,173 new businesses were registered at Companies House beating the previous high of 526,446 in 2013. Shafiq Khan of Clough & Company welcomed the report, describing 2015 as a “golden age” for small businesses, adding that the recession had “completely transformed the outlook for small businesses.”

Tax fears see calm first day for pensions changes
Calls from pensioners to the Government’s Pension Wise hotline were fewer than expected yesterday as fears over a 45% tax hit and the good weather put savers off cashing in their pensions. Hargreaves Lansdown opened yesterday to take calls from pensioners but only a couple of hundred called, with only 7% of them expressing an interest in taking all their pension out in one go. Meanwhile, the ABI has urged pensioners to ignore unsolicited sales calls, texts and emails from people claiming to be advisers. "Criminals may be looking to tempt you with 'too good to be true' offers that could result in you losing some or all of your pension cash and facing a tax bill," the ABI said.

ECONOMY

Steady growth for UK economy
The CBI’s latest growth indicator shows the UK’s GDP grew by 0.7% in the January to March period, slightly up from 0.6% in the last quarter of 2014. However, manufacturing export orders fell sharply hurt by a strong pound and weaker growth was seen in business and professional services, including accountancy, legal and marketing firms. Consumer services and travel and leisure firms strengthened with a positive balance of 18% of firms reporting improved performance in the three months to March. Katja Hall, the CBI's deputy director general, said: "The outlook for 2015 appears encouraging. The benefits of lower oil prices should be increasingly felt, with cheaper petrol boosting households' spending power, and cutting costs for many businesses. The main risk to the UK economy comes from the eurozone, with continuing wrangling over Greece's bailout package stoking uncertainty."

Profits down 60% as redress and fines bite banks
A report by KPMG has found that 60% of the combined profits of Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered were paid out in customer redress and fines for misbehaviour over the past three years. The report, "A Paradox of Forces", found customer remediation, conduct failings and fines continue to be a major issue, with costs having totalled £38.7bn since 2011. Libor manipulation, forex market rigging, money laundering and international sanctions busting have all hit profits.
