Dear Steve,

 

I dont understand the email below ?? my ID is: 795416 (Lyllston Ltd)

I think its an error with another client,

.

On the other hand: for you client (194418) the Basic Accounting is 300£, 

Why the Lyllston Ltd invoice is 300£ + VAT, in fact you gave us an
explanation and we send you 360£(attached the email)

 

Please could you verify and inform us:

1)       The receipt of the bank transfer,

2)        If we have to pay o no VAT for the Accounting Service ?

 

Thank you,

Regards,

 

Eric Gilly

Dear Eric Gilly

None of our clients ever paid VAT for products and services purchased from
www.formationshouse.com because before, our accounting was outsourced
therefore www.formationshouse.com was not liable to charge VAT to their
clients. But now our accounting is done locally in UK therefore from now on
all our clients will be charged VAT for any products or services purhcased.

Reason you cannot see the VAT amount on your auto-generated invoice is
because our system is being updated to integrate VAT calculation for all
invoices, soon system will be able to produce VAT invoices but for now we
have to collect VAT manually. We thank you for your understanding and
co-operation.

Regards
