Dear Steve,

We do get quite some mail for this customer now, so if something is not
delivered (regular mail), there can be 3 reasons:
1) there is a mistake in the address,
2) it is written on the envelope "do not forward",
3) the local postman was not attentive enough.

Regarding courier mail like FedEx, etc. - it is clearly stated on our
website that no courier mail is accepted at the prestigious addresses (due
to the difficulties with re-directing of courier shipments to our office).

If you prefer a prestigious street address in Zurich, Geneva, Lucerne,
Berne, Lugano or Zug, we can set up your address in any of these cities for
an additional fee of EUR 20,00 per month (no courier shipments possible for
prestigious addresses).

However, courier mail can be sent *directly* to our office, and we will
forward it further to the customer.
So you can give to them the address of our office:

BCB Bachstrasse 1
CH-9606 Bütschwil
Switzerland

Just make sure the name of the customer is written properly so that we
could identify it.

Dear
As per your request I have sent the documents to the address of your new
office in Zurich. The package arrived today but the courier did not find
your office in that address. Before they try again to deliver the docs
they had requested a confirmation of the address or an alternative one if
not they will return the package to me.
Therefore I would like you to tell me where and when you will be in the
new office or please give me an alternative site to Fedex to deliver the
package.
Thanks in advance for your urgent reply
All the best
