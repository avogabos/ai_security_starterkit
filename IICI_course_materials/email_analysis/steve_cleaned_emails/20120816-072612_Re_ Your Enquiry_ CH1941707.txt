Dear Sir,

RE: SJS EUROPE LIMITED   07394285

Thank you for your email.

If the reason for restoration is to continue in business or operation the above company is eligible for administrative restoration.

I can confirm that the following documents and filing fees will be required, in order to complete the application for restoration:

Form RT01 with its £100 filing fee

The Treasury Solicitor?s waiver letter. This can be ordered online at bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration/aspx.

Annual Return for the year ending 1st October 2011 with its £40 filing fee

Accounts for the period ending 31st October 2011. Please note there will be no late filing penalties levied,  as the last date for filing these accounts became due after the company was struck off and dissolved.

Please submit all documents and payments in one package, ensuring it is marked for the attention of:  Hilary Newland, Restoration Section, Companies House, Crown Way, Maindy, Cardiff CF14 3UZ
