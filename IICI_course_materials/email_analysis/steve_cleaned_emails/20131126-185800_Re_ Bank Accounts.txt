Hi
Chris
The
issue is that RBS are responsible for updating Aleks, they have no
resposnbility to updating us. When I speak to Raj I always ask him to push it
forward and tell him we are dissatisfied. He has asked for all sorts of
additional documents for the seychelles companies and each time we have gone
out of our way (with no expenses to you) to provide what he asks for. The
account opening is an issue we cannot control. Our service is there is assist
throughout the process by providing what they ask for. Previously we did not
have issues with LLPs, but RBS appear to have changed their compliance and are
very slow to update us. Aleks should chase Raj to find out what the issue is.
In
terms of the fees we charged, we do not issue refunds when we have consistently
delivered the parts of the service we can. All I can suggest is that the fees
are perhaps recredited to use against the renewal fees next year.
I
want your accounts to be resolved, but we are powerless in the banks own
internal operation. We will again attempt to get Raj to give us a clear idea
but he is slow to respond and as a result we aren’t using RBS now for any new
accounts.
Thanks
Charlotte

RE: Bank Accounts
Hi Charlotte
My email was not sent to Raj. I have never emailed him. My
email was sent to you as I wanted an update on all the bank accounts that we
have paid to be set up.
Aleks is in contact with Raj
but he seems to be very slow we replying.
Thanks

please go to the branch as he isn’t informing us of anything more than the fact
