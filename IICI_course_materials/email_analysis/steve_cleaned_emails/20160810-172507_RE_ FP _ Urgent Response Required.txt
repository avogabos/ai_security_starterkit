Hi Steve

Thanks for this.

First, and most important , it is Ms. Farhadi  ðŸ˜Š  My apologies for not making this clear.

Both I and Ms. Farhadi will be equal shareholders, both will be directors and ideally, both will be PSCs

We might aswell take the shareholder protection also.

Re the SIC codes, I have reviewed the list again and 70229, Management Consultancy seems the only fit.

We will send the remaining docs tomorrow.

Regards

John

Hi John



Thank you for your email.



For Director : Mr John F Price, Proof of ID documents is fine. Waiting for
proof of residential address.



For Shareholder : Mr. Nirvana Farhadi, we wait for proof of id and proof of
residential address and also how many shares to be assigned.



Please confirm Mr. Nirvana Farhadi will act only as shareholder for company
'FARADI PRICE LIMITED' and not as director.



We can appoint more than 1 PSC for the company therefore confirm that you
want 'Director : Mr John F Price' and 'Shareholder : Mr. Nirvana Farhadi'
both as PSC for 'FARADI PRICE LIMITED'.



You can add new SIC codes at the time of filing Annual Return which is done
each year on the anniversary of company formation.



Please note that company registrar consider director and shareholder
therefore using Director Protection Service will hide director's address in
public records, you may as well need Share Protection Service to hide
shareholder's address in public records.



Regards



Steve.

Hi Steve

Many thanks for your patience.  Attached is a copy of my I.D. docs.  I am
having problems with my scanner and will have to forward the rest tomorrow.

Once again, I confirm the Co. Name is   'FARADI PRICE LIMITED'

The share holders will be me, John Price (ID attached) and
Nirvana Farhadi (Docs to follow)

Nirvana is also a director of Faradi Financial Solutions Limited

Re the PSC.  Can we have both names as PSCs?

Re SIC Codes, I have given one code in the application.  Can we add to these
afterwards or do we need to review them now?

Many thanks

John

Dear John,



One more point, please note that company registrar consider director and
shareholder as separate entities even though it is the same person and since
you have purchased Director Protection Service which hides director's
address in public records, you may as well need Share Protection Service to
hide shareholder's address in public records.



Please advice.
