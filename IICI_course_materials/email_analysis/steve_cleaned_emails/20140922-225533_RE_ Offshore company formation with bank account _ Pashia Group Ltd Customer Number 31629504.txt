Hello Steve,

I completed the bank form a couple weeks ago but have not goten any feedback yet.  As dicussed prior to opening up my Seychelles IBC with you I also needed to establish a bank account and want this to be with OCBC.  Could you please update me on the status of that, as I was told we needed to travel to London to do so.

I also needed to know the regisired address of my company.in Seychelles for contractual reasons.

Thank you in advance for your assistance 
Sincerely,

Reto
