Dear Steve,

thanks for your reply. Usually I work with advance payment. Please verify the wire transfer 

in attachment of 5000 Euro to AC Grid from Post Finance. Another 5000 Euro I have done to

The order Payment n. 184134 of £ 1515. But please verify also the filling accounts for the 

Salomon Werner Hab Privee and the LDP3 and others companies. I’d like to be perfect for all things

Kind regards

Andrea  Tomasi
