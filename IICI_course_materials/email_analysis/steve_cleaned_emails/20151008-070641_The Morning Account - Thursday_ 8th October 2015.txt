New tax rules fail to impress
Chas Roy-Chowdhury, Head of Taxation at the ACCA, writes to the FT to flag some concerns the association has regarding the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting project. Mr Roy-Chowdhury says the language around dispute resolution is insufficient and the new rules are likely to result in disputes. “We would like to see the OECD look again at the text of article 14 to strengthen and clarify the dispute procedure,” he adds. Anders Dahlbeck of ActionAid also writes to the paper to defend the group’s description of BEPS as a “sticking plaster”. He maintains that while it may patch some holes in the global tax system, its overall lack of ambition falls short. “Corporate tax avoidance in developing countries (which the IMF puts at $200bn a year) will continue to suck funding from key public services,” he concludes.

Think tank and Boris in tax credit warning
A report from the Resolution Foundation says hundreds of thousands of people could struggle to make ends meet next year despite the higher Living Wage. The think tank said the rise in "working poverty" forecast by its experts should force a Government review into tax credit cuts. It comes after Boris Johnson revealed he had asked experts at City Hall to look at mitigating the effects of tax credit cuts on low-income families. The mayor of London has also called for tax credits to be withdrawn in line with Living Wage rises. He told his Ask Boris show on LBC radio: "We've got to make sure that as we reform welfare and the tax system that people who are on the lowest incomes, hard-working people, are not hit by these cuts.”

Buy to let landlords face more tax pain
Victoria Whitlock in the Standard warns that buy-to-let landlords could be hit by even tougher taxes in future, despite a petition currently circulating to get George Osborne to change his mind. “He [Osborne] claims that only wealthier landlords will be affected by the recently announced changes, but that isn't necessarily true, as some of us lower-rate taxpayers will also be tipped into the higher tax bracket because, in future, our mortgage interest payments will be excluded from our costs when our rental profit is determined,” states Ms Whitlock. One option she suggests to landlords is to move rental property into a limited company structure and to take out the profits as dividends, as these are taxed less heavily than regular income.

SMEs

Crowdfunding expansion comes with a warning
The Standard’s Anthony Hilton notes that a growing number of established stock-market players are focusing on crowdfunding, with Numis having bought just over 8% of Crowdcube in July. A new study by St Andrews University also claims that online platforms such as Seedrs, Crowdcube, the Syndicate Room and CrowdBnk have made the UK the fastest-growing market in the world for this form of finance. The survey estimates that just £91m of equity was raised last year, but the figure so far this year is £145m. But according to Ross Brown, one of the report's authors, the explosive growth also raises questions - few of the companies have yet returned a profit for investors and some of the valuations seem “very high” for what are untried or barely developed ideas.

SMEs plan for growth
Research by Clydesdale Bank shows Scottish small businesses are determined to pursue their growth plans despite the impact of rising costs. It found 66% of the 750 SME "decision-makers" surveyed are expecting to invest in their business in the coming year, with new equipment, premises and staff leading their priorities.

SMEs shun insurance
Research by Direct Line for Business shows two thirds of SMEs are currently without Professional Indemnity Insurance, which could leave them vulnerable to legal action if clients suffer financial losses as a result of their negligent or poor advice. Only a third of SMEs - 37% - currently have PII. The research also found that only 733,000 SMEs - 14% - are considering taking out PII in the next 12 months.

FCA investigates mortgage market
The Financial Conduct Authority has launched an investigation into competition in the mortgage market. The regulator is asking lenders, brokers and the public to come forward with their concerns on subjects from lenders’ behaviour, to how easy it is for consumers to find suitable home loans and the impact of the Mortgage Market Review. The FCA said customer information sometimes lacked consistency or was poorly presented, with not enough clarity about charges and fees. Christopher Woolard, FCA director of strategy and competition, stated: “If you want innovation in a market you have to accept that people will come along and do things that don’t fit the existing model. The question is can you make transparent to consumers what the pricing is for those products?”

ECONOMY

Credit crunch looms warns IMF
The IMF has warned that Government and central banks risk ripping the world into a fresh financial crisis as it called time on a corporate debt binge in the developing world. Emerging market companies have “over-borrowed” by $3trn in the last decade, reflecting a quadrupling of private sector debt between 2004 and 2014, according to the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report. The fund said that this dangerous over-leveraging now threatens to unleash a wave of defaults that will imperil an already weak global economy. The IMF’s report added that in Europe, EMU authorities should press ahead with their plans for a banking union to plug the architectural gaps that have undermined the future of the single currency.

Manufacturing bounces back
UK manufacturing picked up by 0.5% in August after a July slump, the ONS said on Wednesday. Car plants came back online after summer shutdowns and industrial output rebounded, the ONS said. But compared with August last year, the country’s manufacturing output was still down 0.8%. Official figures also suggested tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas firms helped the UK's industrial output spurt 1% in August.

Recruitment slows
A report by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and KPMG shows businesses took on new staff at the slowest rate in two and a half years in September, as the number of available skilled staff to fill permanent jobs fell further. Bernard Brown, a partner at KPMG, said: "This relentless tightening of the labour market continues to push pay up in the private sector."

Paying the price for all-male boards
The FT’s Stefan Stern reflects on research by Grant Thornton which shows all-male boards underperform mixed ones by a significant amount. The report, "Women in business - the value of diversity", looked at the performance of listed companies in the UK, US and India and in particular compared boards which contained female executive directors with those that had none. The return on assets was almost 2% higher among S&P 500 businesses with female executive directors, 0.5% higher in the FTSE350 and almost 1% higher with Indian listed companies. Mr Stern concludes that for improvement in company performance it may not be enough just to have more female nonexecutive directors around the top table: “We need more female executive directors, and many more women in senior management positions as well.”
