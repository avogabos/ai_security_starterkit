TAX

Osborne confirms future tax plans
George Osborne says his tax priorities in the next parliament would be to raise the personal threshold for income tax to £12,500 and to increase to £50,000 the level at which workers start paying the higher 40p rate. The chancellor outlined his intentions as he announced that the Budget will be on March 18. He also told the Treasury select committee he would achieve his fiscal targets of a large overall surplus by the end of the next parliament without any need for tax rises. "I have set out proposals that don't require an increase in taxes, including VAT," he said. Labour has stressed that a Conservative government would make "extreme and ideological" spending cuts if it wins the 2015 election, and the Guardian reports that a Guardian/ICM poll shows Labour having opened up a five-point lead in the aftermath of the Autumn Statement.

EU widens corporate tax probe
The EU has widened its probe into corporate tax rulings in light of increased scrutiny of sweetheart tax deals granted by Luxembourg, The European Commission has demanded to see a list of all tax rulings given to companies between 2010 and 2013 from all 28 member states. Previously, the commission had asked to see tax rulings from just six: Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and the UK. Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner responsible for competition policy, stated: "We need a full picture of the tax rulings practices in the EU to identify if and where competition in the single market is being distorted through selective tax advantages."

EU tax rules target dirty money
EU states and the European parliament have struck an agreement intended to stop shell companies being used to finance terrorism, launder money from criminal activity or evade taxes. Central registers will be set up listing the beneficial owners of companies, trusts and other legal entities, giving the name, month and year of birth, nationality and residency of the people who own and profit from them. In addition, banks, accountants, lawyers, real estate agents and casinos will also be required to be more vigilant about suspicious transactions. Krisjanis Karins, an EU lawmaker, said that the registers will "help to lift the veil of secrecy of offshore accounts and greatly aid the fight against money laundering and blatant tax evasion."

Pen and paper plan in place for LBTT
A Holyrood inquiry has heard that hundreds of returns for the SNP's Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) will have to be submitted using pen and paper, if computer systems are not ready for its introduction. Revenue Scotland insisted it was "on track" to have the staff and IT systems in place by the April 1, 2015 start date. But Eleanor Emberson, its head of revenue, said solicitors will have to resort to manually filling out and submitting paper forms for each house purchase if there is an unexpected delay. Separately, the Scotsman reports that the Conservatives are planning to raise the starting rate of the tax to £140,000 - higher than the SNP's planned £135,000 - which would mean 46% of house purchases would be tax-free.

Christmas tax warning
Accountants have warned that employees may be liable for a tax charge if their bosses spend more than £150 per head during the year on entertaining staff. Tax partner Andy Sanford, of Blick Rothenberg, said that firms should monitor expenditure and think about settlement agreements that would ensure employers covered the cost, rather than employees.

New City corruption unit planned
A specialist unit to fight bribery and corruption is to be set up in a bid to clamp down on white-collar crime in the City. The unit, housed in the National Crime Agency, is central to a 60-point anti-corruption plan drawn up in response to Downing Street concerns that repeated scandals are tarnishing London's reputation as a financial centre. The unit will combine the 12-strong City of London Police unit and the Metropolitan Police's 35-strong overseas anti-corruption team, as well as NCA specialists. The government has so far decided against an overhaul of the SFO, although its future remains under review.

Tesco blackhole could be even larger
Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove have claimed the blackhole in Tesco's accounts may be larger than feared. An analysis of accounts at Companies House by the firm found the profit generated by Tesco's UK subsidiaries in the last financial year was £319m less than the profits reported by the company itself in the UK. Jaime Vazquez, analyst at JP Morgan, said: "We are unable to explain the full gap between the Companies House earnings before interest and tax and the reported UK trading profit of 2013/14."

Pensions minister issues fees warning
Pensions minister Steve Webb has told pensions companies they must draw up plans to end "jaw dropping" charges to more than a million customers. His warning comes after a year-long inquiry into the pensions plans offered to staff by companies found savers were exposed to 38 different fees that depleted their funds, with £26bn worth of savings said to be at risk. Researchers found almost a quarter of all the money held in workplace pensions run by insurance companies was under threat, with savers paying more than 3% a year in annual fees in some cases. Mr Webb said he would call representatives from the major pension companies to urgent talks in the new year in an attempt to reach a voluntary solution, but warned that firms which refuse to end the charges will be named and shamed and will face new laws to protect customers' retirement savings.

FSB slams unfair supplier terms
The 2 Sisters Food Group has been accused of demanding unfair terms from its suppliers. The firm asked for up to four months to settle bills and a discount of 3% for paying within 90 days, despite being one of the largest producers of frozen poultry in the UK and a supplier to supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Marks and Spencer. The terms were branded "unfair" by the FSB and the Institute of Directors called on 2 Sisters to "look carefully" at whether its terms were in line with the prompt payment code.

German inheritance tax shake-up
The top court in Germany has ruled that sweeping inheritance tax exemptions for beneficiaries of family-owned corporate wealth must be changed. Private wealth is more unevenly distributed in Germany than any other eurozone state and much of it is held in companies. Existing laws apply to companies regardless of their size and whether there is financial need. Lars Feld, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's panel of economic advisers, said before the ruling: "It is true that in Germany a lot of wealth is concentrated in companies, and inheritance tax is an instrument to correct that a little."

ECONOMY

Wage growth picks up as unemployment falls
Wage growth in the UK is picking up, figures from the ONS indicate. In the August-to-October period, average earnings excluding bonuses were up 1.6% from a year earlier. Including bonuses, earnings rose by 1.4%. It is the first time for six years that both measures of earnings growth have been above the inflation rate. Meanwhile, the number of people unemployed in the quarter fell by 63,000 to 1.96m. The fall was the slowest quarterly fall for a year, leading some analysts to speculate that the rate of improvement may have peaked. The jobless rate was 6%, matching its lowest level in six years.

Oil price fall to boost incomes
The Bank of England says falling oil prices will most likely lead to lower inflation that will help boost household incomes ahead of the election. The minutes to this month's MPC meeting revealed that the Bank expects inflation to fall below 1% in December and remain below the threshold "for some months after that". At the same time, the RAC has predicted that petrol prices could fall to less than £1 a litre as the global price of oil continues to plummet. Meanwhile, the Express notes a recent survey by Moore Stephens has found 18 British oil and gas businesses have become insolvent in 2014, triple the number that went bust last year.

A survey by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills has found eight out of ten people find pay rises the most difficult issue to discuss with their boss. Kate Russell, MD of Russell HR Consulting, advises employees seeking a raise that they should "go with a list of things you have achieved for the company, cost savings you have made, increases in productivity and quality of work you've brought about, projects achieved on time and within budget and ways you have contributed more than your job required."
