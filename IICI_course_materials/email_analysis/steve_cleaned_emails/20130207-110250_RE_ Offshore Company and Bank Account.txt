We did speak about this, as I mentioned, there is no restriction in the
jurisdiction for the company formation, but for the bank account opening it
is better to use consultancy as the business activity not forex or other
financial trading activities as the banks become sensitive in these areas.
Once the accountis open and in functioning without issue they wont question
the activity changing

HI Steve,

 

It was a pleasure speaking to you on the phone.

 

Regarding our request, we are an unregulated forex company and want to open
an offshore company and offshore bank account. You provided us with BVI &
Seychelles options. Can you provide me with more details and also about my
mentioned point that we made a research and found that Seychelles regulator
SIBA, BVI FSC and Belize regulator IFSC recently announced intentions to
become less tolerant to unregulated financial activities operating from
those jurisdictions.

 

Thank you.

 

 Kind Regards,
