Hi Steve

Regarding the invoice for the creation of the MC Capital offshore account, I have paid ?250 against this invoice today and Aleks will be paying another ?250 later today.

In terms of the UK account did you have any luck with the appointment, I would like to get all bank accounts set up by the end of May if possible.

Thanks
Chris
