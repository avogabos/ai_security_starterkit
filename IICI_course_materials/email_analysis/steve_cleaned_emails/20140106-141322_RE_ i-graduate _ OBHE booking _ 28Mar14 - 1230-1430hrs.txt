Dear Oliver,
Thank you for your time on the phone just now, and for helping me with our booking.
My name is Teresa Angulo. I'm with the OBHE, part of i-graduate, and would like to reserve a room for Friday 28 March for two hours from 1230-1430. Right now it looks like there will be 10 people, but that number may change by one or two. We'll need an Internet connection, as well as coffee, tea, biscuits, and water set up in the room by 1230, please.
Could you please book us in and confirm as soon as possible. Could you also please give me a contact name and number at Formations House.
Thank you,
Teresa
