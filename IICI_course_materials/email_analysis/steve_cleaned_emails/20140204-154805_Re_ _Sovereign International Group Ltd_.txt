Dear Steve,

How are you?

We got express mail from Brazil for this customer of yours.
Please ask them if they would like to arrange special forwarding of this
item (by courier, etc.) or if we shouls send it out in the normal way
(priority mail) together with other mail.

Thanks in advance.

Dear Steve,
I am fine, thank you. Hope you, too.
However, I am getting slightly irritated by this customer of yours...
We cannot check if any post has been returned to the sender because we have no contact with the senders and the postmen do not report anybody about the returned mail.
This month we forwarded mail to South Africa on 05.11.13 and 20.11.13. Earlier dates in your can find in my previous emails.
The courier shipment was posted on 20.11.13, together with other mail. I cannot tell you if it had the tracking number you mentioned because we do not record that. By the way, the number you gave produces no search results.
In my personal opinion, the only problem with this customer not receiving his mail is that he cannot provide a reliable forwarding address. If he fixes that, he should have all his mail delivered to him.
Anyway, I have serious suspicions about them and we might resume providing our service to them (will discuss this with my boss and will tell you tomorrow) - read this:
http://www.scam.com/showthread.php?p=1323645
and
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21989.htm
We have had enough problems with the Swiss police because of fraud-and-scam customers and need no more headaches.

Courier
shipments are paid for separately and prior to forwarding.
The
