Dear Steve,
Thank you for your answer.
Actually, after many attempts I have also tried the section " Appointment
of Director". However, checking the statute of Company seems to me that
Maria Stella Pistone is inserted both secretary and Director. This is what
we wanted.
Thank you.

Have a nice day

Simonetta Stabile

Communication from A.Distribution
Dear Steve,
I hope you have started the new year in the best way.
Following your instructions, I tried to change the position
of Maria Stella Pistone from secretary to director and secretary in society.
Whereas I have not found the section "Requirement for Change", I made
several attempts to find a section that would accept my request about Maria
Stella Pistone and I submit it.Having not seen any change on the company
document, I repeated the operation again.
I definitely made a mistake. Can you help me, please? Can you
control my procedure, Please?
Thank you in advance
Best regards
Simonetta Stabile
