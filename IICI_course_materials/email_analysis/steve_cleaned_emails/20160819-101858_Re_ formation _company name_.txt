Good morning Steve,

I just finished a phone call with our client and we could change that registration to UK (England) Limited with registration address and VAT registration.

Novasigma will be still shareholder and i will be the director.

I will collect you all the documents you needed by monday or tuesday. Please let me know how to proceed?

Funtastic events Limited will work perfectly

Thank you

Tuomo Antikainen
