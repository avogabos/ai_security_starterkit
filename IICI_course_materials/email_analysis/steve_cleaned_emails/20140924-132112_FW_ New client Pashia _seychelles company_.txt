Dear Melisa

 

I hope you are well

 

We have a client with a Seychelles company called Pashia Group.

 

The company provides Risk Management Consulting services, and both directors are residents of Switzerland.

 

The anticipated first year turnover is £100k, and then double in the 2nd year.

Please let me know if this is a potential client for your bank and if so could we book an appointment for around 8-10th October. Then I will furnish you with all other information

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
