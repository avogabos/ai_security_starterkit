Dear Felix,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

May I clarify a few points please:

 

1.      Which companies in these countries will the business be trading with
initially?

 

2.      The Amount / Transaction is us$500K. Is that each transaction, or is
that the anticipated 1st year's turnover through the business? I was
informed that contracts were already in place for US$2.5m. If so, can you
let me have details of these contracts please.

 

3.      The business activity is 'consulting'. Can you please expand on
that. Who will the business be consulting with and what will the business be
providing by way of services or products?

 

Many thanks, Felix.

 

Kind regards,

 

Lee.
