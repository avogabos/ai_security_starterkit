Dear Steve,

We still do not have any lines for our company and we are having problems
with that as you understand and the bill will arrive soon to be paid in
December for telephone lines we have not had since July.

Can you please tell me what is going on ASAP?

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,

Maria Banakou
