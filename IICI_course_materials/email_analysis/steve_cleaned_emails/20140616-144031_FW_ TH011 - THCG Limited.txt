I have checked and unfortunately it was a typo at the incorporation stage.

 

It is obviously our fault so we will correct it for you.  You will not incur
any extra charge and the change of name will not create any negative issues
for the company.

 

Gareth will e-mail a form for you to sign off later today to get the name
changed.

 

Once again apologies for the error.

 

Kind regards

Hello Richard

 

Companies House have accepted the incorporation of THGC Limited.  I attach
the certificate of incorporation as not sure how you wanted to let Alistair
know (ie phone call or e-mail?).

 

We will of course need to do the MLR forms, etc.  I am off after tomorrow
and note you are away for a while too so I will diarise for later this
month.  Also need to catch up on how this company fits in with his other
recently formed company?

 

Cheers
