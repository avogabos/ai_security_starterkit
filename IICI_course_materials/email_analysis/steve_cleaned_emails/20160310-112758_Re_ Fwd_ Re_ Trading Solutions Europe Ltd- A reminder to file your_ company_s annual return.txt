Dear Support Team,
I have some  questions regarding the numbers in the Annual Accounts.
1) What is  Directors Loan 1 828.56 on page 03?  The company hadn't loan from director.
2) 1 828.56  is  " Exchange Gain or Loss" for the period which you haven't included   in  Profit & Loss account on page 04. Why?
Please advise.
Best regards,
Aksana Remsha.
