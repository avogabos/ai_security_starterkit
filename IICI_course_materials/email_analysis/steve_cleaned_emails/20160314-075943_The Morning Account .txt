TAX

 

Osborne offers Budget preview

In an interview with the BBCs Andrew Marr, George Osborne has indicated
that he will raise the minimum wage for 21- to 24-year-olds by 3.7% to £6.96
an hour in this weeks Budget. The chancellor also signalled that he will:
Raise the amount at which people are drawn into the 40p tax rate; raise the
personal allowance rate at which people start paying tax by £300, bringing
it closer to the £12,500 target by 2020; crack down on a tax avoidance
loophole that allows television stars to be paid off the books; introduce
up to £2,000 in tax allowances for people who sell goods online or rent
their home out for some extra money; and raise money through a series of
stealth taxes including a significant increase in insurance premium tax.
Meanwhile, Britains lowest-paid workers will be encouraged to save money
with the offer of a £1,200 bonus through a programme called Help to Save.
Each saver will be able to deposit up to £50 a month and receive a 50% bonus
after two years, worth up to £600. In the Times, Ian King argues that Mr
Osborne has so far failed to demonstrate an ambitious tax-reforming or
tax-cutting vision, while in the Telegraph, Roger Bootle says the chancellor
needs to lay out a vision for the tax system that involves both
simplification and lower personal tax rates.

Oxfam: Tax cheats cost Treasury £5bn

A report by Oxfam estimates tax cheats have cost the Treasury £5bn in lost
revenue. The charity believes more than £170bn owned by the wealthiest
Britons is being held offshore in locations such as the Cayman Islands and
Bermuda, costing the exchequer £5bn in lost taxes every year. Oxfams
research also indicates the richest 1% of Britons, a group solely comprising
of millionaires, have received more than a quarter of the £4trn increase in
national wealth since 2000. In addition, it reveals men have benefited far
more from tax cuts for top earners than women. Cutting the top rate from 50p
to 45p four years ago helped 16% of women but 84% of men, the research
suggests.

Business groups caution against tax raid

Leading business groups have urged George Osborne to refrain from a tax raid
on companies in his bid to achieve a budget surplus by the end of the
decade. The BCC has told the chancellor to hold off from imposing more
"burdens for business" when he delivers his Budget on Wednesday. "At a time
when many businesses already face sharply higher costs and taxes, the
chancellor must avoid adding any new obligations on our firms," said Adam
Marshall, acting director general of the BCC.

Landlords bid to avoid buy-to-let crackdown

The Mail reports that a growing number of landlords are using companies to
purchase properties ahead of the crackdown on buy-to-let mortgage lending.
Landlord loans grew by 22% in January compared with the same month in 2015,
as buyers rushed to beat the forthcoming tax changes. At the same time,
property firms are reporting a huge rise in the numbers buying through
companies in a bid to flout the new rules. Individuals who hold a large
number of properties will not have to pay the 3% additional stamp duty on
property purchases that takes effect on April 1st.

Calls grow for business rates reform

Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis has warned that retail jobs will be at risk
unless George Osborne pledges to reform business rates. Mr Lewis cited a
recent report by the British Retail Consortium, which said there could be
900,000 fewer jobs in retail by 2025 as costs including business rates and
the minimum wage rose. Elsewhere, writing in the Telegraph, Stephen Kelly of
the Sage Group highlights a recent survey in which more than a third of SME
owners agreed that reforming business rates would have the biggest impact in
transforming their businesses.

North Sea tax receipts near zero

Tax revenues from the North Sea are set to fall close to zero this year for
the first time since the 1970s, as Britain's oil industry continues to
suffer from the collapse in crude prices. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives
leader Ruth Davidson has urged George Osborne to cut North Sea taxes in this
week's Budget.

multinational companies.

INDUSTRY 

 

New standards create property-lease time bomb

New accounting rules mean Britains biggest companies are facing a £200bn
property debt time bomb. Around 85% of large companies' leases are
currently held off balance sheet, according to research by Cushman &
Wakefield, but all now have to be declared within a three-year window. Until
this year, companies did not have to recognise lease liability for property
on their balance sheets, but the IASB said this meant that analysts and
investors were unable to gauge a company's financial health. It introduced
new standards in January. Around two in three companies will see their
profit margin before tax change by 1% or less, but for some companies the
impact will be far more significant.

FIRMS    

 

PwCs Ian Powell prepares to step down 

Ian Powell, chairman and senior partner at PwC, talks to the Telegraph in a
wide-ranging interview about his time at the firm as he prepares to leave
after 39 years. Topics include auditing the Oscars, the rise in employees
working in cyber  there are now 800  and his ethic of responsible,
profitable growth. Mr Powell says three strands are important for the
continued success of the firm: the continued development of the
international network; bringing the firm together even more to work as one;
and technology, which he says will be the definitive issue over the next
five to 10 years for PwC. When asked about his one regret, Mr Powell says:
Its that we havent made as much progress on the diversity agenda as I
would have hoped. Weve done a lot better than many other organisations, but
I think progress has been slow. He also told the paper that the UK would be
better off economically if it remained in the EU. PwC is undertaking
research into the value of the professional services industry to the UK,
which shows there are 124,000 jobs in the sector, delivering £6.9bn of UK
gross value added exports to the rest of the EU every year.

SMEs accuse Zurich lender

Small business owners have accused specialist lender Dunbar of trying to
make most of its customers bankrupt as it wound down loans. Research by
affected businesses claims that the firm, owned by Zurich Insurance, began
bankruptcy proceedings against almost 200 individuals, from an overall base
of fewer than 300. The Dunbar Action Group is campaigning for compensation
from Zurich, arguing the bank pursued a policy of "bankrupt first, ask
questions later".

Family businesses booming

Research compiled by Oxford Economics for the Institute of Family Business
has found sales in family-run businesses increased by 2% to £1.3trn in the
UK last year. The number of people employed by such companies also rose by
6%, with family firms now employing more than 11.9m people and paying £125bn
worth of taxes each year.

UK small businesses turn tables on banks

SMEs cash holdings rose 7% to £164bn last year, according to the BBA. The
FT notes that Flagstone Investment Management has launched a reverse

ECONOMY

 

Osborne warns of cuts of 50p per £100

George Osborne has warned the UK has to "act now rather than pay later"
ahead of this week's Budget, with further spending cuts planned. The
chancellor told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the cuts would be
"equivalent to 50p in every £100" of public spending by 2020, which was "not
a huge amount in the scheme of things". Mr Osbornes comments come as
calculations from PwC indicate the chancellor will overshoot on his
borrowing target by between £9bn and £13bn over the next four years.
Elsewhere, the FTs leader warns that after shelving planned pension
reforms, Mr Osborne will have to rely even more on finding new cuts in
public spending to meet his fiscal target.

Item Club says cutbacks threaten economy

The EY Item Club has warned that cuts to government spending in the Budget
will put Britain at risk of a downturn. The UK's growth forecasts are set to
be revised down to 2.2% from 2.4% this year by the OBR, and weaker tax
revenues and a smaller economy will also shave £6bn from the estimated
£10.1bn surplus calculated by the OBR in November, according to the Item
Club. In a report on the state of the economy, it called on George Osborne
not to engage in bad economics by announcing further austerity measures to
eliminate the deficit.
