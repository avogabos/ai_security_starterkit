Dear Steve,

Thanks for the feedback.
Please advise if I need to register a company (IBC) in BVI, what would be
the cost.
What are the reason banks do not offer MOTO services.
Throw some light on what you mean by Online Merchant Account. Is it similar
to MOTO.

Any other country you can assist me with MOTO account services.

Thanks in advance.

Regards
Rajesh Attlee
