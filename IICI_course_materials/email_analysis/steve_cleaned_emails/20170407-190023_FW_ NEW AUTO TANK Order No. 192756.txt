Hi Michael,

 

If we are aware that the customer is changing details about the proposed
company to avoid additional questioning, then we will have to reject the
order and file a suspicious activity report.

 

We will need a description of the proposed business no matter what, if we
are to accept the order.

 

Thanks,

Elliot
