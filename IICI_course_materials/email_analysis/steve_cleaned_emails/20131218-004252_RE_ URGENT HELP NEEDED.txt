Steve,

We have a bank strike here today so I couldn't make the transfer.

So, I want to request you to try another card one last time. I used this
friend's credit card during the US company formation and it went through at
one go.

Ofcourse shall send you his passport.

I don't see anymore option to pay using the online system from my
dashboard. Can you add it one last time please? Or if you can take the
order over phone today like we did yesterday. Please let me know.

I just want to take one last chance and if this fails then tomorrow I shall
be going to the bank because they are not operating today.

Waiting for your response.

Pratik

PAYMENT, it's saying
There
are no pending invoices in your account.
Please help.
