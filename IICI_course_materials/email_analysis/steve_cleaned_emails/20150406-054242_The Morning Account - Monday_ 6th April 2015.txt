Conservative’s pressed to rule out top rate tax cut
Both David Cameron and George Osborne have said that cutting the top rate of tax is “not their plan” but have been called upon by Labour to rule such a move out. The PM said: "Our plan is to raise to £12,500 the basic rate threshold, so that we take another million people out of income tax altogether and cut tax for 30m people. That's the plan. We’re also going to raise the 40p threshold to £50,000 because too many middle-income families are being pulled into that tax rate.” Mr Osborne stressed the same points in a separate interview, also using the phrase “that is not our plan”. Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie said the Chancellor had been flushed out and that his refusal to rule out a cut in the top rate of income tax from 45p to 40p showed the Conservative’s priority was the rich. Separately, Danny Alexander has revealed in an interview with the Independent that a senior Conservative minister told the Lib Dems that they should take care of the workers while the Conservatives look after the bosses. He also accused the Tories of “breath-taking hypocrisy” for taking credit for raising the threshold at which people pay tax - while privately arguing for tax cuts for the better-off. Meanwhile, Nick Clegg has described George Osborne as a “very dangerous man” whose plan for the public finances would result in economic "disaster".

Cameron to hail “money-back Monday”
Treasury analysis of the combined tax and welfare changes that come into effect today show 94% of working households will be better off. David Cameron and George Osborne will use the figures in a speech today to mark the start of the new financial year by claiming it is "money-back Monday" when "hard-working taxpayers get to keep more of their own cash". Working households will benefit by an average of £200 a year, the Conservatives will say, while 92% of pensioners will be better off by an average of £180. Among the changes to take effect from today are: a rise in the income tax threshold to £10,600; a 2.5% increase in the weekly state pension from £113.10 to £115.95; the starting level of 40% tax increases from £41,865 to £42,385, an increase in the Isa allowance and the married couples allowance. Mr Cameron will make what he will describe as the "moral case" for low taxation saying there is "no such thing as public money" and voters should keep as much of their income as possible.

UK taxpayers in 60% trap to reach 1m
The number of taxpayers paying a marginal rate of 60% on earnings between £100,000 and £120,000 is expected to reach 1.06m by 2018-19, up from 588,000 in 2010-11 and a projected 791,000 in 2014-15. Patricia Mock, a tax director at Deloitte, pointed out that an increase in the personal allowance meant the band of income on which this 60% effective rate was paid had widened. George Bull, senior tax partner for Baker Tilly, described the anomaly as “a bit of a trap”, adding: “Politically, there is a sense it’s a price that higher-paid individuals have to pay as part of a fairness agenda.” The total paid by those earning above £100,000 is projected to rise to £63.9bn in 2014-15, according to HMRC, up from £47.3bn in 2010-11.

Partnership tax loophole closed
The use of limited partnerships to avoid paying income tax on investor fees is to be halted by HMRC, reports the FT’s Joseph Cotterill. The loophole is used by buyout executives to "disguise" management fees as capital gains. However, alterations to the final legislation mean fears the new rules could have inadvertently taxed some carried interest as income too have been assuaged by establishing that it is individuals who receive carry payments in law. Nick Thornton, partner at Fried Frank, explains: "The real element of stepping stone in this legislation is that it has identified the link between someone's professional activities and their related investment returns, which is necessary to justify the taxation of those returns, at least partly, as active income rather than capital.” "It's not a big step, in legislative as opposed to policy terms, to extend that" to taxing carried interest as income in future,” he added.

Myners says Miliband’s tax plans neither just nor fair
In an interview with the Telegraph, Lord Myners, a former Labour minister, has criticised Ed Miliband’s plan to raise the top rate of tax to 50p describing it as “just not fair” and voiced fears that the move will see revenue from the top rate fall rapidly. He said: "I'm not personally convinced that the 50p tax rate will raise material sums of money. In fact, the evidence suggests there is a tipping point where a marginal rate of tax produces rapidly declining.” He also criticised Labour's plans for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2m, suggesting the threshold should be at least £5m.

UK paying a fifth of all EU VAT
The UK pays almost a fifth of all VAT that goes into the European budget pot, according to new research. Business for Britain’s Matthew Elliott said: "Many people don't realise every time they pay VAT, some of that goes straight to Brussels. Member states should be given greater flexibility." Britain paid £15.4bn in direct VAT contributions to the EU in the seven years to 2013 - which amounts to 18% of the EU's annual VAT revenue. The UK population amounts to just 13% of the EU's total.

Webb: Don’t rush on pensions
Pensions minister Steve Webb has warned savers not to blow their pension today as new rules come into effect that allow over-55’s to cash in their pension pot. He told the Guardian: "I think there is a case for waiting and seeing if you can. You don't have to rush this. Wait and see what products become available. If you are in a position not to make a decision 'about your money' on 6 April, I suggest you don't." Around 20% of pension customers are eligible to cash in funds from today. Scottish Widows said it had recruited 400 extra people to help deal with future pension freedom inquiries. The ABI has also issued a warning to retirees not to rush into making decisions. The Mail describes the pension changes as a shambles claiming the Government has underestimated the number of advisers needed to cope with such radical reform. The Times focuses on the tax implications of taking cash from pension funds suggesting the Treasury could be one of the biggest winners from the reforms.

Enron’s European operations wound up after 14 years
The European operations of collapsed energy company Enron have finally been wound up after a 14-year administration overseen by PwC, which described the insolvency as the biggest the world had ever seen. Tony Lomas, a partner at PwC who oversaw the administration, said his team have eked out £2bn of dividends from the eight groups of Enron companies they took over in 2001 and had returned under 50p in the pound to creditors. Mr Lomas recalls one particularly tricky moment when they realised two power stations valued at £1bn only existed on paper.

Big Data perspective shifts
Andrew Whiffin examines changes in the use of big data in the FT, as firms are increasingly pressed to expand the breadth of data they analyse as part of their decision making process. Marshall Topalansky, managing director at KPMG’s Center of Excellence in Data and Analytics, said the shift in perspective is discernible. “There is a growing sense of the tangible value [of] those who [can] implement a data and analysis strategy,” he says. Accenture is predicting a talent demand in the US that will outstrip supply.

Aim listings fall during 2015
The number of new companies listing on the AIM this year has fallen by 63% from the previous quarter, according to UHY Hacker Young. The first three months of 2015 saw only10 new listings compared with 27 during the previous quarter. Some £84.9m was raised from flotations in the first quarter of the year. Uncertainty ahead of May's election is thought to have deterred small companies from listing.

Former City Link employees take claim to tribunal
More than 300 former staff of City Link are taking their compensation claim to an employment tribunal. The courier firm collapsed on Christmas Eve with the loss of over 2,500 jobs. The firm was owned by Better Capital which JMW Solicitors, acting on behalf of the employees, say failed to properly consult with staff before the firm was closed down.

Investment through EIS reaches £1.4bn
The value of funds invested in start-ups and SMEs through the government's Enterprise Investment Scheme grew by 36% last year, reaching a record £1.4bn, according to HMRC figures. Almost 1,900 businesses have benefitted from the scheme but investors fear moves to tackle tax avoidance could bring limits to the relief after the election. HMRC estimates that the total income tax relief on investments made through the scheme will reach £350m in 2014-15, a 17% increase on 2013-14.
