19.04.2013 Dear Mr. Steve, Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta.Thanks for your reply. Preferably I would not want the exact index page again. if you could find something suitable.You can take the Disclaimer Page , with the changes required in the wordings , specially RFVIL, which stands forRoyal Fortune Ventures (I) Limited should be replaced by FVWL ( Fortune Ventures Worldwide Limited), You can take something from the column About us ---which might be applicable in both the cases for example CMD profile, which in this case would be CEO's Profile, You can put the Statutory Company Info of Fortune Ventures, Company registration, Bank Account Details, You can take something from the Galleries etc. Please see that the contents matches with Fortune Ventures.  The main pages should have a colour to attract. And you would find a WaterMark of our Logo in all the pages , I would prefer that here also, in its format. The main theme of our Business would be  ---- Export & Import, Consultancy in Business Affairs and Corporate Social Responsibilities,Travel & Tourism , Direct Selling and others.  Tabs for this can be made. I will try to give you some feedbacks and suggestions also. KINDLY REMEMBER I WOULD BE TRAVELLING FROM TODAY TILL NEXT 7 DAYS SO  THERE MIGHT BE A DELAY IN REPLYING. BUT I SHALL TRY TO SEND YOU INPUTS.REQUESTING YOU TO KINDLY UPLOAD THE SITE AS STATED YESTERDAY. AS I WILL BE TRAVELLING PEOPLE MIGHT LOG IN TO THE SITE TO SEE. IF THEY SEE NOTHING IS THERE IT WONT LOOK NICE . SO KINDLY UPLOAD AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. i FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AS WE ARE WORKING FROM A DISTANCE --THERE WILL BE LOT OF CHANGES ANR INTERACTIONS DURING THE WEBSITE BUILDING. SO FAR I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE , EVEN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING WEBSITE ----IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE TECHNICAL PERSON UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY YOU WANT. EXCEPTIONS ARE ALWAYS THERE BUT THEY ARE VERY LESS. YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING BUT THEY UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, KINDLY LOOK INTO THAT MATTER, AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TECHNICALLY SOUND PERSONS ARE WELL VERSED IN THEIR WAY BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE CREATIVE WAY. SO FAR THE WEBSITE OF  royalfortuneventures.com is totally my idea and from top to bottom its my creative idea and i know what it took me to do it. I hope you feel the matter. Kindly do the uploading process as requested with a option of changes. Thanks

The design
seems OK . You can go ahead with a check from your side with the brightness and
colour contrast of the design.

 

I would be
