Dear Oseme
Thank you
for your interest in our services, regarding our conversation on phone for

for any other offshore company, following are the details.
The cost to
register a TRUST in Gambia is 750 GBP. I have attached the sample of Charter of

service is GBP 595.
The following services will be included in the company pack:
-Incorporation of Offshore Company
-Registered Office Address

&Articles of Association)
It takes 7 - 10 working days for the
Offshore Company to be formed after we will receive the Notarized
identification documents from you and the signed company incorporation form
that we will provide.
Once the company is formed, it takes 10
working days for the set of the company documents to be delivered to the
address provided by the customer.
You will be required to provide us the NAME
of the company, business plan (Source of initial funds, Proposed business to be
undertake & Estimated annual turnover).
IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS:
1. Proof of ID (copy of passport)
2. Proof of Residence (i.e. any letter
from bank containing the name & address or a copy of your bank statement
dated within the last 3 months)

copy by email first and a Certified copy of the documents must be provided to

The bank
account opening service cost 500 GBP and takes 4-6 weeks to process after
company registration. Please note that we do not guarantee bank account
