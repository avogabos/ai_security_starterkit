Hi Team,

 

We have launched several new offshore products on Formations House, and I am
taking this opportunity to highlight the purpose and structuring of Offshore
companies.

 

Offshore is much more complex than just having a company in a tax free zone,
and we should take care not to give ADVICE - as we do not want to appear as
enabling tax avoidance.

 

A few months several large offshore agents in the UK were filmed by BBC
Panorama advising people to go offshore using an IBC company and not
declaring anything. The agents now have a bad reputation so we will be
careful not to do the same.

 

Plus by giving correct information (not advice) we will most likely increase
sale value.

 

Everyone needs to read the presentation and 2 word doc with details of the
new UKGBC product that will be on our site this week. 

 

Tomorrow at 3pm we will have a conference and go through this to ensure
everyone is fully knowledgeable.

 

Kind regards

 

Charlotte
