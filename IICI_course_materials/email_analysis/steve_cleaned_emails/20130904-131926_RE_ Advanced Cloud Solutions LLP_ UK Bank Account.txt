Hi Steve

 

Another couple of weeks have gone by and still no news about the bank
accounts.

 

Please let me know ASAP what is going on.

 

We need to start trading this month.

 

Regards

Chris

Hi Steve

 

Thanks for the response, but this was the same response from Charlotte more
than 2 weeks ago.

 

Is there something wrong that we need to address

 

Why is it taking so long

 

Regards

Chris

Dear Chris

 

 

We are waiting for the bank to update us on account opening and as soon as
we have the account number we process the VAT Registration.

 

 

Please note that it is necessary to provide bank account number for VAT
registration.

 

 

We will update you soon.

Hi Charlotte

 

Thanks for your time the other day, we both found it very useful.

 

Do you have any update regarding the UK Bank Account/VAT registration.

 

We have a current client that is being billed from another company and we
are very keen to move them over to ACS,

 

So we really need everything setup in order for this to happen.

 

I should also be hand delivering Anthony''s bank forms this afternoon.

 

Thanks

Chris
