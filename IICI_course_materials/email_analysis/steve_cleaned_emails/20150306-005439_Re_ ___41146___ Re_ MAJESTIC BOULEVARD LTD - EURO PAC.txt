Majid,

Thank you for your time today, and your understanding.


We concluded that currently Euro Pacific Bank cannot meet your type of business operations at this time, and a more suitable bank would be a larger institution that is accustomed to oil and gas operations, especially if your wire transfers are going to be large.


Regards,
