Dear Sir/Madam

 Re – CLUB PRESTIGE LIMITED - 09777492

 If the above company is required on the Register, you can apply for it to be Administratively Restored.  To proceed with this process, Companies House will require the following documents:-

 1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100. (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).  

 2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors – https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

 3) CS01 form version 2.0, This CS01 is required for the review period ending – 

 14/09/2017, with the filing fee of £40.

 (This form can be obtained from the Companies House web site www.gov.uk).

 5) Accounts for the period ending -

 30/09/2016

 Having checked our records, there is an outstanding late filing penalty of £750 due, on the 2016 Accounts.

 Please note - We cannot accept a cheque drawn on the company account, as when the company is dissolved, the company bank account is frozen. 
 If you wish to pay by credit /debit card please state this in your covering letter when returning the form. We will then contact you by telephone to take the payment details, once all the documents have been received in an acceptable form.
  
 In regard to your query about the reason that the company was dissolved – The company was dissolved for non-compliance because both the Confirmation Statement and the Accounts were not filed.

 Yours faithfully

 Miss N Hussien

 Restoration Department.
