JM,

We accept all visa and mastercards, not sure what could be the problem and i am forwading this issue to our technical team. Meanwhile you can send card details by filling the attach 'card payment athorisation form' so that we can charge payment manually.

Please download the attachment, print it, fill in all the relevant information, scan it and send back to use along with card holder's 'valid passport' and latest card or bank statement as proof of residential address.

Regards

Steve...
