Ok,

 

We debited once, but one of the attempts to process on line is sitting in
his On HOLD account, so he just needs to tell the bank that it was processed
already and not the process that payment. We have not received the one that
says on hold. 

 

thanks

For order 179820, three attempts were made by customer. Every time logged
the response "Authentication not available"

 

I do not understand your query.

One sec,, did the customer attempt to pay through the online, and the system
didn't let it,, hence why on eof them says ON HOLD.. because his card
provider could not enable it to be completed?

Hi,

 

Can you check we didn't also change through the online merchant checkout as
it looks like that ..

 

If it went through online, then I will refund from the manual terminal here
for the manual payment

 

Thanks
