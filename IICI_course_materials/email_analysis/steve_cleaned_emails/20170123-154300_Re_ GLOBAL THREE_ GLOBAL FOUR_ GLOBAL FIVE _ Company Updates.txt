Dear Steve,

Thank you for your email.

Could you please kindly explain about following items? 
I'm not sure if we need them all. 
Restoration Fee; why is need for? We do not have any bank account or Annual Accounts Filling Services for any of our companies.  
It seems that we will only need resgistered address for Global Four Limited. 

GLOBAL FOUR LIMITED (Company number 09544950) - UK Limited Company dissolved/strike-off on 27 September 2016 - Company Restoration Cost:
 
- Restoration Fee and Service charges : GBP 2700
- Late\OverDue Annual Returns Filing : GBP 150
- Late\OverDue Annual Accounts Filing : GBP 500
- Registered Address Re-Activation and Renewal : GBP 200
- Director Privacy Service Re-Activation and Renewal : GBP 300
- Shareholder Privacy Service Activation : GBP 150
 

I also would like to mention that we updated our services for Global Three Limited. All sorted now. 


We do not need to register Global Five Limited yet. We do not need to Offshore Company Registration in Seychelles. 

Many thanks & Regards,
Hale
