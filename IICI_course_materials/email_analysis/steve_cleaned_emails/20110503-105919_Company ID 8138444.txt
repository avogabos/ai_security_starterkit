Steve, 
Per our conversations, here is the information about the status of our accounts:

Year ending 1/31/2010 - I was provided with CT600 with instructions for signature and filing.  However, I was unable to complete because I did not have the UTR.

Below is a summary of the contact I have had with Formations House regarding getting this number:

Feb 12, 2010 - Was advised that UTR is on the form CT41G that is sent to the customer by HRMC
I responded that I had never received it, and that I thought, as our representative, that Formations House should have been provided this information.

Mar 3, 2010 - Was advised that UTR had "not yet been posted to us".  But, that as soon as it is received, it would be uploaded to our online account.  This indicated to me that Form CT41G was a document being sent to us by HMRC. 

In contradiction, this email also advised that I could "file the CT41G form now", by accessing the form online at HMRC website.  A link was provided to a blank form:  For Dormant Companies:
http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ctsa/ct41g-dci.pdf 

This was completely confusing, because now instead of form CT41G being sent to us, this blank form indicates something that has to be complete and submitted to HMRC.  However, this form includes a space for the UTR, which, of course, I do not have.

At some point I was referred to this form on our online account - but I have never been able to access or open this link.

Mar 18, 2011 - I inquired the status of the UTR, as it had been over a year since the company was formed by Formations House.

Mar 19, 2010 - Was advised that Formations House had not yet received the UTR, but have requested it be sent to the Registered Office Address, set up by Formations House.  It would be emailed to me once received.

August 16, 2010 - Was advised that HMRC had changes it's policy and was no longer providing UTR to anyone other than the Director of the Company and was advised to phone HMRC Helpline.

The Directory of the Company, Adam Alexander, has not done this - due, in part, because of the time difference, his busy schedule, and quite frankly, because this is the kind of accounting function that he feels he has paid your company to handle for us.  The fact that we have been provided such incomplete, inconsistent and contradictory information is extremely disappointing.  However, at this point we have no choice but to continue paying for your services - at lease until we get this mess resolved.

Now, from what I understand from you, the CT41G IS a document issued by HMRC and should be available for me to access, along with our other company documents, on the website.

For your reference, I have attached the blank form CT41G that I mentioned to you.  

Also attached are four (4) letters from HMRC we received via email from your company regarding delinquency and penalties for tax returns not filed.  These letters list a Company Tax Reference Number.  If this is the same as the UTR, then I can now file the return.

Base upon our conversations, this is what I believe needs to be completed to keep our accounts current:

AR01 - Annual Return - year ending 1/31/2010 - completed
AR01 - Annual Return - year ending 1/31/2011 - have filed online through Formations House website

AA02 - Dormant Accounts - year ending 1/31/1010 - per August 17, 2010 email, this was e-filed by Formations House.
AA02 - Dormant Accounts - year ending 1/31/2011 - requested & paid for this service on 4/26/2011

CT600 - Tax Return -  year ending1/31/2010.  This form has been sent to me, I just need the UTR to complete and mail in.
CT600 - Tax Return - year ending 1/31/2011 - requested & paid for this service on 4/26/2011, along with AA02 form above.

Unfortunately, I have discovered another issue while reviewing all this information.  The August 17, 2010 email indicates that our account reflected one  remaining accounting service which will cover the preparation of DCA and CT600 for year ending 1/31/2011.  This, of course, was not completed, which is why I ordered the additional services for 75 pounds on April 26th.  I have now paid for this service twice.

Steve, I hope I have provide this information clearly enough so that we can finally get this resolved.  If there is any other requirement that I have not listed, please advise accordingly.  Otherwise, I look forward to receiving the UTR and CT41G so that I can file these tax returns.  Further, after review of the delinquency letters attached, if you are of the opinion that these penalties can be waived upon submission of a letter of explanation from Formations House, then please forward one that I can included with the filing.

Thank you for your time,
Stefanie Schwaderer
