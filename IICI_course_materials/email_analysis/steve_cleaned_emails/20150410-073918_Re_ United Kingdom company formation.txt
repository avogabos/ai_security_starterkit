Dear Steve,

Than you for you quick response.  Unfortunately, we must have the separation of nominee directors and addresses.  If that requirement changes for us I will contact you regarding further business opportunities.

Joel Magazine

United Kingdom company formation
Dear Steve,
My name is Joel
Magazine. I am a retired United States Lawyer who now consults for several
software development companies, primarily in Canada.  I am a close friend
and associate of Mr. Tom Wells from Payment Solutions Priority Payout
Corporation,  who has conducted business with you and your company over
the last several years.  I recently mentioned to him that I was intending
to set up several United Kingdom companies in the near future.  He has
suggested that I contact you regarding the formation and setting up of these
companies for my clients.
Here is what I
request from you and what I can supply to you:
1.             
I need to set up five to ten United Kingdom based companies.
2.             
I don’t want any of the companies to have a London proper address.
3.             
Each company must have a unique and different mailing address.
4.             
Each company must have different nominee directors.
a.    
Each nominee director will have to produce a copy of a passport and a current
utility bill for compliance purposes.
b.    
Each nominee director must be an individual and not a company
5.             
Each company needs to provide the ultimate beneficial owner with a full
set of corporate documents such as articles of incorporation, memorandum of
understanding, share certificates, share register and any additional documents
necessary for UK compliance.
6.             
The nominee directors will need to provide each ultimate beneficial owner with
a Power of Attorney.
7.             
I will provide you with the ultimate beneficial owner’s name for each company.
8.             
I will provide you with all the “know you client” information from each UBO
needed for you company’s record keeping compliance:
a.    
Copy of signed passport.
b.    
Copy of a current utility bill.
c.     
A reference letter from a lawyer, banker or other professional.
d.    
Contact information: Cell phone and email.
e.
Any other KYC or Due Diligence that you may
require.
9.             
 The ultimate beneficial owners will be primarily Canadian or US citizens.
The two main goals I
am looking to accomplish are
(1) speed of incorporation and necessary
compliance and (2) complete separation of each new company (IE different
address, different nominee directors)
.  If you can be of service to me
please give me an estimate of the cost for setting up each company, the yearly
registration and management fees and the estimated time to set up the companies
with the above criteria.
If you can be of
service please contact me at the below email and we can set up a direct call to
get things started.
