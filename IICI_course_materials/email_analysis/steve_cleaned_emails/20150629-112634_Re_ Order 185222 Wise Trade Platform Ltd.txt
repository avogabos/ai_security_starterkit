Good Morning Steve,

now we are a week on formation of a simple company. Yes, you offered a
better price than most of your competitors but I haven't expected that this
take so much time for registering with Seychelles registry,

I will loss a client if I have no certificate of incorporation as soon as
possible.

Please give me a note if you are unable to form this company; than I need
to use another company to setting up. After review of our mails it shows
you are doing this as part-time; I don't know why I got responses with
delays all time.


Regards


Heiko Schroter
