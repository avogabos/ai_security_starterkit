If FORTUNE VENTURES WORLDWIDE LIMITED does not tell HMRC at the right time,
they may have to account for tax they have not collected and they may be
charged a penalty. 

If FORTUNE VENTURES WORLDWIDE LIMITED do not agree with the decision  ask
for the decision to be reviewed by an HMRC officer not previously involved
in the matter, or appeal to an independent tribunal.
