Dear Chris,

I did not receive the email dated 4th .. have checked through outlook. Did I reply? As nothing in sent items either.

Anyway, I have added the VAT registration to your account. You will need to login and complete about 6 questions on the business and invoiced amounts. Then we can submit it. It will also ask for the NI number of the director. Here you should put Aleks and Anthony.

You can put the date of registration as today, then when the number comes through you can reissue any invoices from after the date of registration with the correct VAT number.

You cant officially invoice with VAT until you have one, but you can reinvoice for the VAT amount later if the date of registration entered when applying is before the invoice date.

HMRC often will come back with a few questions, but this usually happens within 20days of application or its gets its decision within 20 days.

PAYE can be setup faily quickly, but I will need our accountant to check whats needed for LLP PAYE reg.

Steve will come back to you will all costs for this

Thanks

Charlotte

Also, let me know how soon PAYE can be set up

Hi Charlotte

We finally have the bank account setup.

So can you go ahead and register us for VAT.

Also, I would like to talk to you about the accounting and PAYE functions.

We should have money coming into the company from May onwards and I would like to be paid through PAYE from that time.

Please let me know what you need to proceed.

Thanks
Chris
