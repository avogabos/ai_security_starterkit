Hello Steve

 

Please find attached the passports for Hannah and Richard Dell, plus their
council tax bill for this year (2017).  The intended business activity is
Medical consultants and the expected annual turnover is between £100-150k.

 

Regarding PSC, they are both 50% shareholders, so do have significant
control over the company, but do not have the right to appoint directors
themselves.

 

Regarding myself, I am a Chartered Management Accountant and have agreed to
act as their reporting accountant.  My business Excellent Finances Ltd, is
an accountancy practice and turn over between £75k-£100k per annum.  I am
attaching my passport for your records, but need to ask if you need
personal or business proof of address?

 

Do you want me to update my email address to my work address 
david.sadler@excellentfinances.co.uk
<mailto:david.sadler@excellentfinances.co.uk> ?  Will this help?

 

Kind regards

David
