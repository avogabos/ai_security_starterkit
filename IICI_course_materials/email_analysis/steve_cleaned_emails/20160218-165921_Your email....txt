Dear Steve, 

Thank you for your email.

I have to close the company and I'm almost out of money.

I need your opinion please. I'll pay you to stop the company, but I want to do less with HMRC.

For several months I did not make any sales.

Here is my question: The cheapest with HMRC and with you it may be to do the accounts until today.

Between April 1 2015 and today I have not sold and I put in my pocket money to pay fees and wages. 

I have one excel sheet I joined you to show you.

I will of course pay you your job, but you can well advise me?

I understood that I pay for my almond delay (see HMRC document attached)

If it's too late and I pay almonds, it is perhaps better to stop the company with the calculation of accounts until today?

Thank you for your advice.

Jean-Jacques Gomez.
