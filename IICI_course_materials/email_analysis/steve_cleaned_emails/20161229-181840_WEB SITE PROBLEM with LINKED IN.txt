Subject: WEB SITE PROBLEM with LINKED IN

Dear Steve,

I hope you had or are still having long and restful holidays.

I just want to drop a line to ask you to amend my web page with the LinkedIn link  :  https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?locale=en_US&trk=preview-profile-no-action-dlg <https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?locale=en_US&trk=preview-profile-no-action-dlg>

as it does not appear when someone does actually press the LinkedIn button on the web site.

Can you please change the copyright to 2017 from 2016 at the bottom of each page  and kindly remove the picture of HARLEY STREET from the Contact US page as it does not load?

We are gong to start operating from 1/1/2017 so everything has to be in order!

I do thank you in advance for all you help as always.

Best regards,

Maria

P.S. Is the Corporation Tax filing and annual accounts ok?  I have not received anything from your end and I am a bit worried since tomorrow is the end of the month/year
