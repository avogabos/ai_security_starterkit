Steve... let me share
CFI's Company Formations
'secret of success' with you
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's the passion!

The Commitment. And the lengths that we are all prepared to go to bring you the 
best company formations service in Ireland... guaranteed!

But that's only part of it.

The real reason why CFI can so consistently guarantee you the very best company
formations and company secretarial service in Ireland is because we are passionate
about what we do for you.

Not for us in CFI the almost routine impersonal 'tick here and email it back to 
us' company formations service that is sadly becoming all to prevalent in Ireland
nowadays. No. no! Ours is a 100% personal service.

We are a 'hands on & people' company. 

We take great pride in the personal service that we offer you. 

Between us, we have centuries of experience in Company Formation 
and Company Informationwork in Ireland. We offer you a level of experience and 
expertise,Steve, which few, if indeed any, of our competitors can match.

Next time you have a company formations requirement, or a company secretarial problem,
or a company shareholding question that needs answering, in the St. Valentine week
that is in it we'd really LOVE to hear from you personally, 
Steve.

Yours sincerely,


Sean Kavanagh
Managing Director

PS Steve, any time you like, you are always welcome to call me personally on 01
664 11 11. Just ask for me by name and, as you can see from my... eh! heavenly ...
picture at the top of this Ezine, I can happily go to Hell & Back to deliver you
with another winner!
