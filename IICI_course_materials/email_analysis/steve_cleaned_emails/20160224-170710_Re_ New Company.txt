Dear
Alfio Pacifici
Thank you for your interest in our services. Following is information on our
Ready-Made (pre-registered) UK Companies and Company’s Bank Account.
You can view list our UK ready-made companies on this link:
http://www.formationshouse.com/search/readymade.php
Price for companies available on the above mentioned link start from GBP 265.
These companies have been dormant since their registration. These companies are
not VAT registered and no active bank account is associated with these
companies.
To process bank account for these companies, cost is GBP 500 and takes 4-8
weeks. To have a UK bank account, UK banks now prefer to provide services to
those UK companies, where company director can show his/her presence in UK.
Therefore banks in UK now call company director to meet in person with the bank
branch manager. If company director is not able to fulfill this requirement
then we can offer bank account with an offshore bank in St. Vincent Islands where
company director presence is not required and bank account can be processed
remotely.
We also have few UK ready-made companies for which we have opened bank
accounts. Bank account is with a UK bank. After purchase of company, bank
account will be transferred by changing signatory for the bank account. And to
change the signatory UK bank will call upon new company director to visit the
bank and meet the bank branch manager. Bank Account transfer process can take
from 2-3 weeks. Otherwise we can process new bank account with an offshore bank
in St. Vincent Islands and it can take from 4-8 weeks.
Following is the information on our UK ready-made companies with bank account.
Company Name: BUSINESS RESOURCES ASIA
Bank Account: YES
Bank Name: ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND - UK

UK ready-made companies with bank account have been dormant companies since
registration. These companies are not VAT registered.
For some reason if you need one the above companies with trading history, then
we can submit active accounts showing minimum transactions on back date. The

The minimum requirement for a UK company is:

office address
- 1 human director
- 1 shareholder (Director can also be a shareholder)
In case if you do not want to provide or cannot provide VALID UK (England and
Wales) postal address for company’s registered office address then you
choose to use our Registered Office Address service for GBP 25 for the 1st year
and from 2nd year onwards cost for the renewal of Registered Address service is
GBP 100 per annum.
Please note that Registered Address service allows our client companies to use
our address for the purpose of UK company registration and receive mails from
Companies House and HMRC only. Company cannot use our address as a general
mailing address.
To use our address as company’s general mailing address you can purchase
our Virtual Office InfiniOffice Mail Only service for GBP 275 for 12 months.
If required to have VAT registration for the above companies the cost will be
as following:
If you can provide company’s actual trading address within UK then VAT
registration can be processed for GBP 50 and will take 2-6 weeks to process.
If you cannot provide or do not have company’s actual trading address
within UK then VAT registration will be processed for GBP 1000 and will take
4-6 weeks to process. The price GBP 1000 includes:
- VAT Registration
- Virtual Office InfiniOffice Mail Only service for 12 months
- Value Accounting (preparation and filing of annual accounts and tax returns)
- OutSource Accounts Department (preparation and filing of VAT returns)
UK ready-made company will be transferred to you within 2-3 working days after
we receive the order, payment and due diligence documents. Also an online
account on our website will be created from where you can manage, view and
download company documents.
UK ready-made companies without bank account which are available on our website
can be purchased online. For UK ready-made companies with bank account you have
to place an order by sending us an email to
support@formationshouse.com
.
Payment can be made by credit/debit card or bank transfer.
Documents required for due diligence for company formation:
Scan color copies of following documents are required for company beneficial
owner/director/s and shareholder/s. Please make sure that scans are clear and
in readable size and format.

2. Proof of Residential Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR
electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (date, name,
