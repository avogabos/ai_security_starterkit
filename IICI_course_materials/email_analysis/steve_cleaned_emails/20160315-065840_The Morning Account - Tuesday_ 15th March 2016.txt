TAX

 

Chancellor urged to deliver Budget boost

Dr Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to the Mayor of London, examines the challenges which London will face over the coming decades. He believes that in economic terms, the countries that are adaptable, flexible and that can control their own destiny are those most likely to succeed, and urges George Osborne to deliver a Budget “that would give London a boost like the big bang.” Elsewhere, Allister Heath in the Telegraph predicts that the Budget will be “remarkably uneventful,” with the Chancellor keen to appeal to as many voters as possible ahead of the EU referendum. Also in the Telegraph, William Hague calls on the Chancellor to hold his nerve and go ahead with £4bn of fresh cuts to government spending.

LV cries foul at plan to hike insurance tax 

LV, the UK’s biggest mutual insurer, has criticised a planned hike in a controversial insurance tax, warning it will penalise customers for insuring their valuables. George Osborne is considering proposals to increase the Insurance Premium Tax in tomorrow's Budget from 9.5% to 12.5%. LV chief executive Mike Rogers said customers would bear the brunt of any increase and urged the Treasury not to raise the tax, which was hiked from 6% to 9.5% in November. Mr Rogers' comments came as LV announced group operating profit rose £195m for the year ending December from £86m in 2014. MPs have also warned the Chancellor he risks defeat in the Commons if he presses ahead with a 2p rise in fuel duty in the Budget.

Death tax concerns

Solicitors have warned that a sharp rise in rise in probate fees will heap an extra logistical – as well as financial – burden on executors and families. Currently executors pay a flat fee of £215 for probate regardless of the size of the estate. Under new rules, which the Government is consulting on, a sliding scale of fees will be introduced, capped at £20,000 for estates worth more than £2m. Gary Rycroft, a solicitor and member of the Law Society’s Wills committee, explains: “A significant increase in probate fees will result in more potential cashflow issues for families. It could well turn out to be like another form of inheritance tax, payable before probate is granted, and making difficulties for those estates where there is not a lot of cash”.

The Daily Telegraph

 

Tax roadmap to show business the way

The Treasury is to publish a ‘business tax roadmap’ outlining how companies will be taxed in the remainder of the decade as part of George Osborne’s plans to tackle corporate tax avoidance. The Chancellor is also expected to announce a cut in tax relief for large multinationals who deliberately shift their debt to the UK to take advantage of HMRC's tax credits system. The Treasury says the new tax roadmap will “give businesses the certainty they need to plan long-term investment” and will enable HMRC to tackle base erosion and profit shifting.

Will Scots stand for higher taxes?

Scott Macnab in the Scotsman considers whether Scotland is in a position to move to a higher tax society. He highlights that 83% of Scots workers are on the basic rate of tax, while a further 15% are on the higher 40p rate and just 20,000 pay the top rate. As a result, he predicts high income payers - which provide well over 50% of income tax in Scotland - would be more likely to move if they found the tax environment more attractive south of the Border.

UK bookmakers hit by fear of higher taxes

Bookmakers fear another tax increase in Wednesday’s Budget, with the Government considering a review of digital advertising, most of which in the gambling sector is currently channelled offshore.

PENSIONS

 

Millions to get better pensions advice, says FCA

Consumers will be able to get better and cheaper advice on their pensions and savings under a plan launched by the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority aimed at some 16m people trapped in a ‘financial advice gap’. Among recommended changes are the use of ‘robo-advisors’, which allow banks and other firms to guide customers through a range of investment options using online algorithms. Firms may be given more flexibility in training employees to give financial advice, and consumers could be given limited access to their pension pots to pay for advice.

Hermes opposes BHS rent cut demands

Hermes Investment Management, a landlord of two BHS stores, has opposed the retailer’s plan to slash rents in a bid to stave-off administration. BHS wants landlords of 40 stores to agree to cut rents by 75% and is demanding reductions of 25% or 50% at a further 47 sites, but Hermes said it is not in favour of the department store chain’s CVA. Meanwhile, the FT’s leader says the Pensions Regulator must press former BHS owner Sir Philip Green over the firm’s pension scheme, in order to demonstrate that past owners cannot simply walk away from pension schemes when they get into a mess.

Farming help

Accountants holding membership of the AAT are now able to complete forms on behalf of ‘active farmers’ who qualify for the Basic Payments Scheme, the Government has announced.

FIRMS

 

Firms commit to take on more apprentices

Leaders from seven businesses including Deloitte have met at the Shard to commit to employing more apprentices. New research has found that misconceptions about salaries for apprentices are putting off young people from signing up for them. One in seven young people questioned in a study said that their parents did not approve of apprenticeships, while 10% believed apprenticeship programmes offered no recognised qualification. The launch of National Apprenticeship Week sees 500 companies pledging to create more than 1,400 apprenticeships.

Deloitte enters Canadian legal market

Deloitte Canada is to move into the country’s legal market after announcing the formation of Deloitte Conduit Law LLP. The new entity will offer outsourced lawyers to support in-house legal teams and meet business needs on-demand at law firms. The Law Society Gazette notes that Deloitte is the only one of the Big Four accountancy firms not to create alternative business structures to enter the UK market.

Cost of textile group’s failure mounts up

Documents lodged at Companies House reveal KPMG has charged almost £300,000 for just over a month’s work on the administration of cashmere producer Hawick Knitwear. The largest single charge, for more than £82,000 and covering 219 hours, related to the sale of the business. KPMG estimates that the remainder of the insolvency will incur a further £173,000 worth of work.

Northern Ireland win for Begbies

Begbies Traynor has won a major insolvency services contract for the Northern Ireland government’s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI). The firm’s Scotland and Northern Ireland-based insolvency team has been brought in by the government department to help the DETI manage the province’s historically high levels of both individual and corporate insolvency.

SMEs

 

Princes Trust backing helps SMEs

Businesses that are started with funding and mentoring support from The Prince's Trust are more likely to survive than those who go it alone, according to new research. Analysis by Wavehill and NatWest found that 73% of Trust-supported businesses continue to operate into their third year, compared with the national figure of 61%.

ECONOMY

 

CBI members against Brexit

The CBI says 80% of members questioned in a survey want to stay in the EU. The group said the majority of nearly 800 firms taking part felt Britain remaining in Europe was "better for business, jobs and prosperity", although it also stressed it would not align itself with either side of the debate. The survey of 773 companies by ComRes found that large organisations within the CBI were more likely than SMEs to want to remain in the EU. Overall, 5% of businesses that took part in the survey thought that it would be in their company's best interests for Britain to leave Europe while 15% were unsure.

Help To Save concerns

Martin Lewis, the founder of Moneysavingexpert.com, has warned that the Government’s Help To Save scheme, which aims to encourage low earners to save, could tempt those in debt to try and put money aside instead of paying off their loans, therefore making them worse off in the long term. Meanwhile, former pensions minister Steve Webb warned: "It would be unfortunate if the initiative turned into a new mis-selling scandal, with workers discovering they could have got a better deal from a pension." Elsewhere, the Times’ leader welcomes the new scheme, arguing that incentives to save are part of an enterprise culture.
