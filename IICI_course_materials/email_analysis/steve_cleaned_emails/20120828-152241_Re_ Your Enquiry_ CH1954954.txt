Dear Sir,

RE: EBIZTONE INVESTMENT LIMITED   07521292

Thank you for your email, concerning the above company

Information on restoring a company to the register can be obtained form our website at www.companieshouse.gov.uk<http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/> -  (please refer to "Guidance" on our homepage and then select GP4  Strike off, Dissolution and Restoration"), alternatively from the Treasury Solicitors website- www.tsol.gov.uk<http://www.tsol.gov.uk/>

Please note that the above company is not eligible to apply for administrative restoration as this procedure does not apply to companies struck off the Register at their own request.

 A company that has voluntarily applied to be struck off, can only be restored by an Order of Court.

If the company is being restored to continue to trade, then you would need to apply to a Court for a Restoration Order.

Please note that Court Order restoration can be quite a costly procedure. If there are no assets remaining in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and re-use the original name if that name is still available. Further information on company incorporations is available from the Companies House website.

Please note the following documents will be required if the company wishes to be restored in order to continue in business or operation:

Accounts for the period ending 29th February 2012

Annual Return for the year ending 8th February 2012 with its £40 filing fee.

I can confirm that there will be no late filing penalty levied, at the first set of Accounts for the period ending 29th February 2012 were not due to be filed until after the company was struck off.

If you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully,
Maxine Hartrey
