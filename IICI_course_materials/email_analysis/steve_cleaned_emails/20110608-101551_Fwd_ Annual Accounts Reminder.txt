There have been several issues surrounding our account filings that I have been trying to resolve for many months now.

According to a email correspondence from Steve Smith of your company (cc'd here), as of May 25th, your office is applying for a new online gateway PIN to file these returns on our behalf.

Please advise and confirm what is going on with our account, as we continue to receive emails and notifications from different departments within your organization.  It appears as if there is no consistency of information - no one is reviewing our file and resoling these long standing issues.

Regards,
Stefanie Schwaderer
