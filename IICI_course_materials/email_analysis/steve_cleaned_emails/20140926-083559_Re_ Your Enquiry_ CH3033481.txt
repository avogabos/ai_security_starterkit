3)  Annual Return forms for 14 November 2012 and 2013 - each requires a £40 filing fee.  Please note that the Annual Return for 14 November 2014 is due for filing no later than 12 December 2014.

4)  Accounts for the periods ending  30 November 2012 and 2013.  There will not be any late filing penalties for these accounts as they became due after the company was dissolved.
