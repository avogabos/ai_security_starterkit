Dear Steve,

Does this mean that I am re-scheduled and it is final for the 29th December
2014?
Do I have to prepare a business plan for the bank to have with me or should
I simply explain to them the nature of my business during our meeting?

MB Capital Ventures will:

1. Participate as a shareholder with 10% in a U.K. FOREX company which has
all necessary licenses as required by law

2. Provide Money Manager services/advice to the above mentioned company and
to it's clients (legal and physical entities)

3. Will provide sales and marketing services to similar companies apart
from the one that it will participate in

4. Will be involved in international commerce mainly in the field of olive
oil re-selling and agricultural products originating from Greece

Pls advise on best approach.

Regards

Maro
