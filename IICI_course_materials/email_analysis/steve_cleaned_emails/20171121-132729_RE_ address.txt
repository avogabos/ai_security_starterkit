Hi Steve

 

Just to check this is still the correct registered address for Staff Travel Voyage Limited

Or is it this one:

 

The registered office of the Company is situated at the offices of MAYFAIR TRUST GROUP

LIMITED, Second Floor, The Quadrant, Manglier Street, P.O. Box 1312 Victoria, Mahé,

Seychelles.

 

 

I recall a previous email saying the original address on the top had not changed becuase the company was formed previous to a particular date, appreciate if can confirm.

 

 

Also is there a postcode?
