Dear Steve,

It is all MY fault but we have COMPLETELY forgotten to write the address on the business cards whereas we have in the letterhead and on the site perfectly.

Please be kind enough to have your graphic designers put the address on the card as well and please send the template over to me once more. 

I received the cards from you today and when I opened up the parcel realized there was no address on the card only telephone numbers name and site..
I can't present them to anyone as you can understand.

If you want to charge me because I did not notice in time before pls feel free to do so. 

In anticipation of your answer,

Kind regards,


Maro Banakou
