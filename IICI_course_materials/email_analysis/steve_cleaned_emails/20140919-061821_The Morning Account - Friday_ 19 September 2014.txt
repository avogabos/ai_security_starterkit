TAX

Tax change hits foreign buyers
The FT reports that a "little-noticed" tax change introduced in early August has added to the recent slowdown in sales of luxury London homes to foreign buyers. Non-domiciled residents must now pay tax of up to 45% when they use overseas assets as collateral to finance purchases in Britain, whereas previously, foreign assets such as stocks, shares and property could be used as security for borrowings in Britain with no tax charge. The move is being viewed as the latest in a series of government efforts to clamp down on foreign buyers. It comes after George Osborne announced plans in 2012 to impose CGT on expensive properties owned through companies, and after the government also imposed an annual tax on homes held in companies, which has raised £198m in 10 months according to HMRC figures. Sue Moore of the ICAEW confirmed the latest change would cost some non-doms "a significant amount of money".

Mansion tax warning for Labour
Research by the estate agents Savills suggests a quarter of all London homes that would be hit by a "mansion tax" are in Labour constituencies. The Times suggests the proposed tax could be an issue for voters in marginal Labour seats, noting that some Labour MPs, candidates and local councillors are worried that the tax, which Labour wants to levy on properties worth more than £2m, could "unfairly target their constituents and deter people from voting Labour." Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said that the crucial question was whether the tax was designed to be "a significant revenue raiser or a playing field leveller".

EU court rules against Spain over tax rules
The European Court of Justice has ruled that Spanish authorities cannot charge different rates of IHT for residents and non-residents. According to Jason Porter of wealth managers Blevins Franks the difference was residents and non-residents pay can be as much as 80%-plus. Experts believe the verdict could open the floodgates to thousands of Britons reclaiming tax. Luis Cuervo, head of Spanish Legal Reclaims, a firm of lawyers specialising in inheritance, commented: "People who have paid more can appeal to have their money paid back now. But you might even have to go to court to get a refund. There will be a lot of paperwork and it must be perfect. The tax office is going to look at everything because they don't want to pay it back."

Calls for Amazon antitrust inquiry
British publishers are calling for a competition inquiry into Amazon's dominance, warning that it has resulted in "a chronic and debilitating imbalance for authors, publishers and booksellers". Richard Mollet, chief executive of the Publishers Association, says an inquiry by the CMA would provide "independent, forensic analysis" of Amazon's behaviour. The suggestion comes shortly after James Daunt, the chief executive of Waterstones, told the FT that it was "effectively impossible" to compete in the British e-book market because of Amazon's "extreme negative profit margin" and the tax advantage from its Luxembourg headquarters. However, Amazon rejected his suggestions, saying that it "pays all applicable taxes". Elsewhere, Amol Rajan suggests that the technology industry is experiencing a backlash from the public, in part because of the tax avoidance strategies used by internet giants such as Google and Amazon.

Leisure chief attacks DCMS
Nick Varney, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, which owns the London Eye, Madame Tussauds and Legoland, has branded the Department for Culture, Media and Sport a "third rate cr*ppy department" as he attacked the Government's failure to cut VAT on Britain's tourism industry. UK tourism businesses are subject to the current 20% rate of VAT which puts the UK at a competitive disadvantage compared to its European rivals. The average rate of VAT applied to visitor accommodation across the rest of the EU is 10.8% while 19 member states have a rate of 10% or less.

Filmmakers urged to take advantage of tax credits
Zygi Kamasa, chief executive of the British arm of entertainment company Lionsgate, has called on ITV and BSkyB to take advantage of the UK's tax credit system and step up investment in independent UK-based movies. "London is arguably the best city in the world 'for film making', with an amazing tax credit system," said Mr Kamasa.

Pro. Manchester chair sets targets
John Jones, partner at Beever and Struthers and the new chairman of Pro. Manchester, has set a target of growing the membership body's revenues to £1m. Pro. Manchester, which represents financial and professional services in the city, has developed a series of sector groups over the past year and has also recently re-aligned its business to include corporate membership enabling businesses outside of the financial and professional services industry to engage with its member firms.

Phones 4u debt-for-equity swap rejected
Phones 4u administrator PwC has warned that plans for a debt-for-equity swap have "no realistic chance" of success. PwC said that it would instead continue talks to sell parts of the mobile phone retailer. Additionally, advice will be taken on whether there are legal grounds for claims against the mobile operators, Phones 4u's directors, or its owner - BC Partners. PwC also revealed the company has a £110m cash balance available to bondholders, £89m in stock, predominately in new handsets, and is owed around £147 from mobile groups. However, it also owes £220m, with over half outstanding to suppliers.

Deloitte overseeing ESBD restructuring
Deloitte has been appointed to help oversee a restructuring of ESBD and aid in preparing the operation for a potential sale. The move comes after Dubai Financial Services Authority said it had taken a series of regulatory actions due to the "rapid onset of financial difficulties at the wider ES Group in recent months", including replacing the board of directors with a manager since August 11.

Law firms hit by rise in sterling
New research has shown that the rise in sterling has hit profits at the UK's biggest law firms. The top ten UK firms by revenue saw their fee income drop by 2.7% in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the same period last year. Jeremy Black of Deloitte, which compiled the data, explained that the larger firms have sizeable overseas networks which have been hit more heavily by sterling touching record highs. "Part of it is to do with the exchange rate, and part of it is to do with generally doing business in London, which has performed strongly both in comparison with the rest of the country and globally," he stated.

Labour wants business to back living wage
Ed Miliband is expected to announce that firms seeking government work would have to pay the 'living wage' under a Labour government. Mr Miliband's adviser on the issue, Alan Buckle, is said to have launched a discreet bid to persuade business leaders to sign an open letter backing the idea. However, Conservative MP Brian Binley, a member of the Commons business select committee, said politicians should be cautious about imposing big wage increases on employers. "Most small businesses I know want to pay people the best wage they can because it is the best way to keep good people. But ultimately they can only pay what they can afford," he stated.

ECONOMY

Mixed month for manufacturers
The CBI's latest Industrial Trends Survey has revealed that UK manufacturers had a mixed month in September, with production continuing to rise steadily but order books deteriorating. The survey showed that over a third of manufacturers recognised that their export order books were below normal, with just 14% saying that they were above the mark, giving a final balance of -24% - well below the long-run average of -20%. Meanwhile, 34% of firms saw the volume of output rise in the last three months, with 19% reporting a fall, giving a balance of +15%.

Mortgage appetite begins to wane
The Council of Mortgage Lenders has said that borrowers' appetite for home loans is "starting to wane" despite an annual rise in mortgage lending. The CML said gross mortgage lending reached £18.6bn in August, down 5% on July but 13% higher than the same period last year. It added that the seasonally-adjusted figure had been relatively flat since the start of the year, suggesting activity was at a plateau.

Hodge: London must push for devo max too
In an opinion piece for the Evening Standard, Margaret Hodge, the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, argues that the time has now come to make "devo max" a reality for London. She says that giving City Hall and the boroughs control over all property taxes, council tax, business rates, stamp duty and capital gains tax on property, would enable all the partners, public, private and community, to get on with the task of investing for Londoners.
