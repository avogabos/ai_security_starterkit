Hi Steve


In our case no one has invested money in the LLP only the cost of the shares - so I presume that is £1 each.

Hi Chris

‘Members capital investment in LLP’ means that how much contribution each partner has done in the partnership at the start of it. Contribution is the initial investment which can be cash brought in a business or any asset brought in a business.

Dear Chris

We can file Dormant Accounts for the period mentioned, the cost is half of the usual as we still have to file to Companies House and HMRC.

You will need to get the UTRs either way as even for dormant its required.

Let me know what you want to order, and Steve will raise an invoice for you
