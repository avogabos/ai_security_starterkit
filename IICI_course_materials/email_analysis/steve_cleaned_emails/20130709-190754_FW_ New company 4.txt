Dear Delphine,

Kim must be director on only one of the companies!!! Sorry for the
misunderstanding, on HJG Media . The rest should have the company I had
forwarded you earlier as director together with the shareholder of the
companies , of which I had already forwarded passport . Here is it again.

Please amend at your earliest and send me the company certificates. Will
effect payment tomorrow once I confirm all in good order.

 

Regards

Jon
