Hi Steve,

Thank you very much for the reply. I am not sure about our account as we 
have 3 or 4 accounts with you - we got new one every time of annual 
accounting for several years. So I am not sure which one is correct for 
now. Could you please tell me which account should we use for ordering? 
We will try to order Value Accounting and registered address renewal, I 
will ask for help if we get issues with it.

Thank you for care,
Alex

Hi Alex
Thank you for your email.
We can certainly assist you in filing
          the annual returns.
For filing accounts you can place the
          order for Value Accounting
          GBP 300 using the Accounting Services section in your account
          at our website,
          make payment and then send us your transactions for
          processing. If you face any
          problem let me know and I will place the order for you.
Also note that you need to renew the
          registered address
          for GBP 100 ASAP.
Regards
Steve

Hi Oliver,
We have just chat with you. Our company is Staince Investments, Ltd. and
we'd like to use your service for annual accounting again. I need a bit
of help with a payment for your services (we used your service several
times and every time there is something new :)) and a template for an
accounting data - we usually send out our transactions list using your
templates and the rest is done by your company, including reports to
Companies House. I would be happy if we could do the same this time.
Thank you for care,
Alex
