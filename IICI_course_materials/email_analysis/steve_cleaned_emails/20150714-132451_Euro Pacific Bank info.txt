Dear Vincent, 

Please find attached bank forms and certified ID, the certified corporate documents are to follow in my next email.

Unfortunately, I was unable to register the client online as there are no fields for the country Syrian Arabic Republic for the link you have sent me previously, please advise.

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Kind regards
