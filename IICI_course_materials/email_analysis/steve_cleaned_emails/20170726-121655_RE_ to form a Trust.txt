Dear Mr Jaafar,

 

In order to best offer the right solution I would like to ask the following
information:

What will the purpose of the trust be

Will the trust operate as a business at all

Who will be the settlor and who will the beneficiaries be.. 

The trustee will be responsible for the management of the trust assets. Can
you briefly explain what the assets what be, and whether there will be a
paid up capital entered in the trust within the first 3 months of formation?

Where is the trustee domiciled

 

A Trust can be formed is 2 ways. One is usually as a non profit company with
a clearly defined deed for operating. The other is not an incorporated
company in the sense of your intention for it, It is a legal agreement and
usually requires the services of a Trust solicitor. 

 

We are not Solicitors and therefore cannot provide point 4 explicitly.
However we can provide a letter that states the law relating the company
regulations of a trust. The Trust deed should ideally also be registered
with a solicitor or trust account who specialises in trust management  we
are able to provide a suitable legal contact for this. In terms of our own
compliance and data protection policies, we will not disclose any
information to any party unless it is a UK government authorised disclosure
request.

 

I can state our typically fees for a non profit incorporation are £1500
however you are expected to provide the trust deed/ charitable deed. These
types of incorporation require 2 trustees at least.

 

Depending on the answers to the above I cant give a clearer price or
definitve solution to offer

thnaks
