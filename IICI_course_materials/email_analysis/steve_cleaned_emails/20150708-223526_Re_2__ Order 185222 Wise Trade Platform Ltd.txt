 Good Morning, 
  unfortunately you didn't found time to response to my email from friday so I request company documents again for ordered and paid company above. 
  I'm sure something is wrong and I expected more professionality for an experienced company like yours. 
  Here's my summary: 
  22/06/2015: order has been taken and payment has been done by faster payment
  25/06/2015: after all requestimng all details with your order, you found out that you need this documents also signed
  01/07/2015: you submitted a company registration number which is unable to recognise with Seychelles registry. 
  01/07/2015: you requested all company documents signed; tis has been returned to you on same day
  03/07/2015: another request for company documents (certificates etc) - no response
  03/07/2015: check with Seychelles registry - no company incorporated
  03/07/2015: your given company number cannot be validated and is different to typical registration numbers on Seychelles
  03/07/2015: online chek in your companies mangement system - there is no order or a company to find. your name check shows this company name available. 
 I'm awaiting an immediate response to my email in this matter !!!
