OECD tax changes bring hope for end to corporate tax avoidance
The OECD’s tax director, Pascal Saint-Amans, has said its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting tax reforms will help move away from “an era when tax planning was part of core business models” and become more of “some supportive, marginal activity.” The OECD released what it called "extremely conservative" estimates suggesting that large global businesses were shifting profits and eroding the tax receipts of economies around the world at a cost of between $100bn (£65bn) to $240bn (£160bn) a year. However, tax campaigners have complained that rules on tax deductions on interest payments and taxing firms using controlled foreign companies will be optional. Baker Tilly’s Rebecca Reading points out that the OECD can’t make law “so there's still a long way to go” while KPMG’s head of tax policy Chris Morgan says: “Broadly, multinationals will see their tax bills go up when these recommendations are implemented. The real test will be in how countries implement the recommendations.” Stella Amiss of PwC said the OECD’s achievement “should not be underestimated,” adding that it could hit “UK companies that are heavily debt financed.” The FT argues that the OECD’s BEPS is more than a “sticking plaster” solution, as some have claimed. Country-by-country reporting should prove particularly useful, the paper says, although the OECD may regret the reports being kept private. It was public outrage at how little tax is paid by multinationals that pushed the topic up the political agenda in the first place.

Councils can keep £26bn in business rates
Local councils across England will be able to keep all proceeds from business rates raised in their area under new plans unveiled by George Osborne. The Chancellor said the move would see £26bn diverted from central government to local government. Mr Osborne said the change, due to be in place by 2020, would mean cities and communities no longer had to go to the government “with a begging bowl”. Councils will be able to cut rates as the current uniform rate will be axed. Gary Porter of the Local Government Association said the change would be a “vital boost” to investment in infrastructure and public services. Meanwhile, CBI director-general John Cridland said that if the change was a way to cut business rates, “then it will spur councils to take a pro-growth approach, and has the CBI's support”. Labour expressed concern over the plan and warned it could start a “race to the bottom” with councils competing to cut their rates the most.

Film tax fraudsters used ring of tax havens
Birmingham crown court yesterday heard how five men created an international operation to evade tax through a £262m film investment scheme. The group used government tax breaks for the film industry to create the appearance of huge "paper" losses. Accountant and film producer Keith Hayley was described as the "principal architect of the scheme", which used the London-based company Little Wing Films to operate the scam, and allegedly made £8m. Investors in the schemes included pop stars, politicians and aristocrats, according to the Times. Investments were transferred from Britain to an account in Monaco, then to British Virgin Islands, on to Guernsey and then back to British Virgin Islands before returning to the UK, the prosecution’s lawyer said.

PwC reclaims Big Four lead
PwC has retaken the title of world's largest professional services firm from Deloitte after a 10% jump in revenues to $35.4bn.Global chairman Dennis Nally said the results showed the firm had the "capabilities and skills that the marketplace is really looking for". Consulting now accounts for more than 30% of total revenues after growing 18% to $11.2bn during the fiscal year. PwC’s auditing division grew 6.2% to $15.2bn in a year. It lost contracts with Tesco and J. Sainsbury and BAT but won mandates with Santander and Diageo. The firm’s Middle East and African operations reported the fastest growth in revenues, rising 11.4% to $1.3bn, followed by North America and the Caribbean where there was a 10.5% increase to $14bn. Deloitte last month reported revenue growth of 7.2% to $35.2bn, while EY reported growth of 11.6% to $28.7bn in September. KPMG is expected to report in December.

Top 100 Graduate Employers
PwC has been rated the UK's leading graduate employer for the twelfth year running. PwC's reign at the top has been driven by its consistently high profile at many of the country's best-known universities, says the Times. The 15th edition of the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers top ten now has Aldi in 2nd place, followed by Google in 3rd, having climbed six places. Teach First falls down to 4th while the civil service is 5th. Deloitte, EY and KPMG appear in 6th, 8th and 9th places respectively. The Times notes that BDO is now 94th after dropping out in previous years.

Rare opportunity for UK’s tech revolution
The FT looks at some of the UK’s SME success stories and asks how the UK could do more to help foster the next Facebook. The paper draws out key issues such as recruitment problems and tax breaks for investors. Some say measures such as the SEIS could go further, however, by raising caps on investment. Meanwhile, Erkko Autio at London’s Imperial College Business School, describes the UK’s start-up culture as “dynamic but unevenly distributed”. That said, the UK faces a once-in-a-century opportunity to grab opportunities offered by digital technology. Saul Klein, founder of Seedcamp and former partner at Index Ventures says the UK entrepreneurial revolution has only just begun. “We have the chance to be one of the great tech nations.”

Varley calls for joint action
Writing in the FT, Steve Varley, UK chairman and managing partner for UK & Ireland at EY, says that in order for the UK to remain a centre for businesses with a positive impact on employment and growth, entrepreneurs, business and government need to join forces. He goes on to talk about EY’s Entrepreneur of the Year UK programme, which this year was won by Richard Steeves the founder of Synergy Health, who will now compete against the best entrepreneurs from all over the world at EY’s World Entrepreneur of the Year Awards.

Most SMEs see no results from social media marketing
SMEs owners may be wasting their time promoting themselves on social media, according to a survey commissioned by consultancy Deal With The Media.

The remaining 38% said promoting their business on Facebook or Twitter had been beneficial to their business.

Tech and skills remain focus for SMEs
The Telegraph runs a supplement looking at the outlook for SMEs, stating that low inflation, falling oil prices and increased household disposable incomes should provide them with some optimism for Q4 of 2015 and beyond. The paper examines challenges facing SMEs, such as funding and attracting talent; and where they are likely to invest. Technology remains the number one priority for investment.

ECONOMY

Manufacturing weakness spreads to services
Growth in the UK service sector slowed further in September to its lowest rate in nearly two and a half years. The latest Markit/CIPS PMI fell to 53.3 last month from 55.6 in August. Although above 50, indicating growth, it was the lowest figure since April 2013 as global uncertainty and weak UK manufacturing weighed on businesses. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the economy looks to have grown by 0.5% in the third quarter of the year and just 0.3% in September. The slowdown is likely to mean the Bank of England will not raise interest rates until well into 2016. Mr Williamson added: “Persistent weakness of the manufacturing sector has increasingly spread to the far larger services economy in recent months. There are also signs that consumers have become more cautious.”

Taxpayers' Alliance: Cut pensioner benefits now

Alex Wild of the Taxpayers' Alliance has suggested that ministers should waste no time in making unpopular cuts to pensioner benefits, as many of those hit by a cut to the winter fuel allowance might "not be around" at the next election and others "would forget" which party had done it. "So on a purely practical basis I would say do it immediately. That might be one of those things I regret saying in later life but that would be my practical advice to the government," added Mr Wild.

OECD tax changes bring hope for end to corporate tax avoidance
The OECD’s tax director, Pascal Saint-Amans, has said its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting tax reforms will help move away from “an era when tax planning was part of core business models” and
 become more of “some supportive, marginal activity.” The OECD released what it called "extremely conservative" estimates suggesting that large global businesses were shifting profits and eroding the tax receipts of economies around the world at a cost of between
 $100bn (£65bn) to $240bn (£160bn) a year. However, tax campaigners have complained that rules on tax deductions on interest payments and taxing firms using controlled foreign companies will be optional.
Baker Tilly
’s Rebecca Reading points out that the OECD can’t make law “so there's still a long way to go” while
KPMG
’s head of tax policy Chris Morgan says: “Broadly, multinationals will see their tax bills go up when these recommendations are implemented. The real test will be in how countries implement the recommendations.” Stella Amiss of
