Steve

I have tried to file annual return for Direct Plus now overdue on companies
house website. They ask for an authentication code which I don't have. Do
you have it? If so please advise. They now say they are sending a copy of
it but as your address is the registered office they are sending it to you.

What can I do about this I need to file the return asap

Also what is the deadline for filing annual accounts?

Please advise asap. Many thanks

Phil

I have tried to file annual return for Direct Plus now overdue on companies house website. They ask for an authentication code which I don't have. Do you have it? If so please advise. They now say they are sending a copy of it but as your address is the registered office they are sending it to you.
What can I do about this I need to file the return asap
Also what is the deadline for filing annual accounts?
Please advise asap. Many thanks
Phil

Dear
Phil
Company
Protection Service 50 GBP per annum will hide director and secretary’s
address, it does not include shareholder address hiding. For shareholder it is
separate service Shareholder Protection Service 25 GBP per annum.
The
name will be visible all the time, however address will not be available for
public. In case of any legal issue original address will be released.
After
transferring shares to new shareholder, filing annual returns will update new
shareholder information in the registrar records and it will the be available
for public viewing.
You
can file Annual Return online using Online Company Administrator service.
You
just need to enter the SIC code. You can select your code by clicking on the
LOOK UP button available with text box.

Re: Direct Plus LTD : UK ReadyMade Company Order
Thanks
Steve,
Few
more quick questions:
*so for £50 I can hide both director and shareholder addresses right?
*Out
of interest if this is taken are these addresses viewable by anyone at all? such
as government based organisations, enforcement agencies, debt collection
agencies etc?
(I
realise the name will be viewable regardless by anyone)?
*For
the filing of annual return for shareholder change, so anyone checking can see
I am indeed the shareholder, is this form NHB001 ?
*Also
as this is normally an annual return what is the situation re filing it now
simply with a change of shareholder info?
*Does
this affect anything else?
*Can
I do it on line?
*I
notice it says I have to select a 5 digit SIC code, do I just enter one or how
do I regisiter one?
Appreciate
the info
Phil

Dear
Phil
You
are not required to provide due diligence documents for the new director.
Changes
filed through Online Company Administrator will be automatically update with
company registrar. However to update shareholder information, please file
Annual Returns using the Online Company Administrator service.
To
change email account and password for your account, please use UPDATE PROFILE
option available in your account.
The
privacy service allows you to hide director and shareholder address. Please
note director and shareholder name will be visible in public records.
If
you purchasing Company Protection service for 50 GBP per annum, then you will
not need Director Protection Service because it is included in the package. For
shareholder protection you will need Shareholder Protection Service for 25 GBP
per annum.

Steve

Steve
as well as the questions below, please advise what is the directors and company
privacy protection service and how much does it cost - does this hide company
director and shareholder names from view? Can anyone access this information if
this service is taken?
Also
please confirm per last:
Have
changed co director and shareholder to myself. Do I need send anything to
anyone..passport copy, bank statement etc? Well this automatically be
registered at companies house? If someone does a company check will they see me
as the director, shareholder as of now?
Also
how do I change the email address and password for the account? I can log in
using the ID that I have and the password but afterwards when I looked to see
if there were any messages it asked for email and password and we put in
lorrainewhiskin@gmail.com
and the password we have of jouvenat it doesn't work?
Please

Steve,
in addition to Lorraines last 2 points:
Please
remind us our ID and password?
Does
that service cover change of shareholders?
Please
also remind me your fees to provide a nominee director out of interest?
Presume
no such thing as nominee shareholders? or undisclosed maybe?

Dear Phil
Thank you for the documents.
Shares information for DIRECT PLUS
LTD is
Share Capital: 1000 GBP
Value Per Share: 1 GBP
Share Certificates: 1000
Shares assign to Lorraine Whiskin: 1
Unalloted shares: 999
In UK company you have share capital
as unpaid.
WHAT IS SHARE CAPITAL?
Share capital is the investment in a
company by its members (owners). The amount is contributed in exchange for the
share of ownership, a certificate being issued for each share.
When a company is established, the people who form the company decide that the
member's liability is limited to their contributed share capital. The
Memorandum of Association for a company states the following things in this
regard:
Total
     share capital of the company
The
     division of share capital into shares of fixed amount
The
     names of the people who have agreed to own shares and the number of shares
     each will own.
Those people who have agreed to take
some or all of the company shares are called "Subscribers"
WHAT IS AUTHORISED SHARE CAPITAL?
Authorised share capital is the
maximum value of shares that can be distributed to existing or potential
investors. In other words, the amount of share capital stated in the Memorandum
of Association is the company's 'authorised' share capital. The company's
authorised share capital may also be called its 'nominal' share capital.
IS THERE A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM SHARE
CAPITAL?
Minimum of 1 share is required for a
private limited company and there is no maximum share capital limit.
WHAT IS ISSUED CAPITAL?
Issued capital is the value of the
shares issued to shareholders. The amount of issued capital cannot exceed the
amount of the authorised capital.
A private limited company is not required to issue all of its share capital at
once.

Steve
