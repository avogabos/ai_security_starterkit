Dear Siddhartha,

 

Regarding the VAT issue, when we met last time and discussed the VAT I
mentioned clearly that when a new company requests a VAT number prior to
meeting the £74k threshold required, then HMRC will always request further
information to ensure the business in questions does not intend to gain a
VAT number for misuse. This happens 9 times out of 10 applications when its
a new untraded company. The questions received from HMRC are requesting
further information which we can guide you but we would not have. What would
be useful will be some invoices for stock from suppliers (where vat is shown
as charged) Suppliers can be EU or UK based in this regard. As you do not
yet have customers, we will explain this. Also because you intend to sell
online, we can explain this on the form.

 

We can answer most questions on your behalf but we will need the supplier
papers. The VAT registration service is not a managed service, it is just a
portal to apply for VAT. As we are conducting other business with you we
will assist you in answering the questions but you need to be aware that the
questions have nothing to do with a incorrect application for VAT.

 

Re the incorrect director name, I will check with Steve what the current
situation is but we use the name provided and we will cross check with the
ID given. We will get it rectified either way.

 

RBS do not typically come back to us directly, they usually go to the
customer. I will chase him and request that he email you in the least

 

I will communicate further via Steve with any updates.

 

 

Kind Regards,

Dear Mam,
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta.
I sincerely believe that all is superbly well with you and your business.
 
Mam, off late I was in China for some business work, so was a bit out of
touch with you.
But i regularly get the mails sent by Mr. Steve in answer to that of
Bruno's.
What I can sense is that there has been gap in communication and
functioning.
 
Firstly the name of Bruno has been wrongly written with the register of
companies which has
immensely delayed the Banking operations. They have not yet sent the
Debit/ATM cards for that
reason. I find Bruno sendng number of mails for rectification of that.
 
I have not yet received any official feedback in regards to our account with
RBS. If we would have
not informed you about the opening of our HSBC account, just imajine where
would have we stood
today. What is the status of that ???? Do they do not have the basic
courtesy to inform the applicant
whether their application is accepted or rejected ???
 
Regarding VAT ---I got a mail from Mr. Steve-- the substance of the mail was
-- The competant authority is
not satisfied with the details of our application. Mam I think it is
probarbly the responsibility of Formation
House to get it done in the right way ?? As you are very well aware that we
are about to start the business.
There is nothing hide and seek in it.
 
May I humbly request you to kindly look into the matter, inspite of your
very busy schedule, and get it solved.
All set and done , we may be too small a business house, BUT WE ARE THE
CLIENT OF FORMATION HOUSE.
 
Will wait for your reply ASAP.

With sincere compliments & best wishes....
