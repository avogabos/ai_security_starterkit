Dear Customer

 

 

As per standard rules set by the industry there is a difference between Company’s Registered Address Service and Company’s Mail Forwarding Address.

 

 

With the Mailing Address service we forward, or hold for collection, any regular mail that arrives at our office. 

 

 

If you have the Mailing Address service on its own you are not able to use our address as your Registered Office. Because of this we will not forward any official mail, such as Companies House or HMRC mail, on to you as it should not be getting sent to us.

 

 

Which brings us to the Registered Office Address service. With this service you are able to use our address as your Registered Office and we will forward on any official mail. Although please note, if you just have the Registered Office service and no Mailing Address, we will only forward on official mail.

 

 

Please see the attach files which shows that since 2014 we are explaining and requesting you to either purchase our Registered Address service along with Mailing Address service or remove our address as company’s registered address. In one of the message Mr. Daz Singh confirmed that company will purchase Registered Address service and requested ordering information but after that we never received anything on this issue.

 

 

As per service terms and condition, we are not responsible for letters that your company is receiving on our address from Companies House and HMRC but from the date of company incorporation, as good gesture we are not returning your letters back to Companies House or HMRC and these letters are being forwarded to you regularly.

 

 

And now we request you again to please purchase the Registered Address service from the year August 2013 till August 2016 and make payment of GBP 300 (GBP 100 per annum) as soon as possible. If we did not received the payment till 15th April 2016, we will file an application with Companies House that our address is being used by your company without our consent, also we will return any letter received from Companies House or HMRC. Any of these letters can be crucial and if not responded in due time can cause company to be dissolved and company directors to be penalized.

 

 

Use following information to pay by bank transfer and once payment is done please send us the bank transfer receipt.

 

Account name : AC Online Ltd (29 Harley Street London W1G 9QR)

Bank : Santander Corporate (Bridle Road Bootle Merseyside L30 4GB)

Sort Code: 09-02-22

Account number: 10339811

Currency: GBP

BIC\SWIFT: ABBYGB2LXXX

IBAN: GB76ABBY09022210339811

 

 

Along with copy of bank transfer receipt also provide following information and documents:


Company Name:
Company Registration Number:
Company's Companies House Web-Filing Authentication Code
Color Scan copy of Proof of ID - Valid Passport (bearer signature must be visible) for director and shareholder
Color Scan copy of Proof of Residential Address for director and shareholder. Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement. (date, name, address and account number must be visible)

 

(Please do not send telephone, mobile, tv or internet bill, these are not acceptable.)

 

 

I hope that this email will give you a clear idea about the difference in services and their usage.

 

 

Please reply as soon as possible.
