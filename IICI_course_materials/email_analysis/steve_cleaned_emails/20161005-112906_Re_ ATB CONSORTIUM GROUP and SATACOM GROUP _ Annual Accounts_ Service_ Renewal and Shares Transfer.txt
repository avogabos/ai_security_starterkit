Hello


Please accept 2 invoices from that client forgot to provide.
And please send me again new draft of the accounts then.
(He wants to pay about 400 pounds tax)

Aslo client asked me what was the correct financial period of his accounts?
He provided statement for 2015 year. Financial period  from 31.01.2015 to
30.01.2016.
But in draft he could see 2014 and 2015 year.

Just he asked me why there is 2014 year, but i dont know how to explain him
correctly.
Maybe you could help me with right answer.

Many thanks in advance,

Best regards,
Ekaterina.
