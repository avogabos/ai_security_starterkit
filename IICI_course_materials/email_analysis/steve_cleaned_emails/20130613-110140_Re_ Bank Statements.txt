Hi Charlotte

Were you able to send the bank statements from Anthony to RBS?

Also, can you get back to me on the account status - has it been started?

I also need to know what has to be done to get the off shores accounts up
and running.

We expect to be getting in funds at the start of July so we need all these
accounts in place by then,

Finally did we ask you to register Advanced Cloud Solutions for VAT? This
is required.

Thanks
Chris

In terms of the off shore accounts, I presume you need the share certificates signed and returned and the bank forms completed.
Is this correct?
