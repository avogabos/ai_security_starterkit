Dear Steve,

I am pleased to inform you that Ireland’s leading Company Formation and Corporate Service Provider, Company Bureau (CompanyFormations.ie) currently has a limited number of Irish Readymade/Shelf Companies available for immediate purchase.
We have a mixture of new and aged Readymade Companies including two very valuable companies that were incorporated prior to the 1st January 2015 when the ‘Double Irish’ or ‘Dutch Sandwich’ tax avoidance mechanism was ended for newly incorporated companies.  

We also have available an Irish Readymade Company with VAT number included. This company and all our readymade companies have not commenced trading and are 100% dormant. 

For more information on our services with preferential rates to professional intermediaries, or to reserve your readymade company today, please don’t hesitate to contact Andrew Lambe or Philip Hayden on +353 1 6461625 or e-mail andrew@companybureau.ie.
