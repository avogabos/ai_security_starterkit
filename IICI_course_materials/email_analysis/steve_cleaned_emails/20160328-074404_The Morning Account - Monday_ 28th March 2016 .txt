TAX

 

Landlords rush to incorporate ahead of tax changes 

A study of Companies House and Office for National Statistics data by the Telegraph shows 4,560 property companies have been incorporated in the past three months, allowing buy-to-let property investors to avoid new taxes on rental income. The number is just over a 50% rise on the same period a year ago. Investors in the higher rate tax bracket will face new limits on their ability to offset mortgage interest against their rental income from next week. However, the rule does do not apply to corporate investors who will also benefit from a lower rate of corporation tax, which is due to be cut to 17% in the tax year 2020-2021, as well as reduced CGT charges. Due to other costs though, incorporating only makes sense for investors with more than 10 properties, says Gary Heynes at RSM. Elsewhere, the Express talks to experts about the rush to beat the stamp duty surcharge which has sent prices soaring, but first-time buyers should be prepared to act as many believe the market will “drop like a stone” after April.

Abolition of Serps brings rise in NI payments for millions 

Changes to NI payments coming into effect next month will see over 6m workers take home less pay. The abolition of the second state pension (Serps), announced three years ago, will mean employers and employees who opted out of Serps will have to pay higher NI rates. From now on people will just receive the single-tier pension. Workers face an extra 1.4% of NI on earnings, but employers will be hit by a rise of about 3.4%. Workers who are paying into final salary retirement schemes are expected to be hit by demands from their employers for higher pension contributions in addition to the tax hike. It is estimated that 1.5m in the private sector and 5m in the public sector will be affected by the move, which will net the Treasury £5.5bn a year. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: “Members of final salary occupational pension schemes and their employers will now be paying the same NI contributions as the rest of us. Since they will be building up just the same state pension rights this can only be right.”

McDonnell says Osborne looking after wealthy minority 

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has claimed George Osborne’s cut to CGT is handing an average of £3,000 to 0.3% of the population, funded by taking the same amount from hundreds of thousands of disabled people. The Chancellor cut CGT from 28% to 20% for higher rate taxpayers and 18% to 10% for those on the basic rate in his budget. A spokesman for Mr Osborne said the changes mean the government is encouraging investment in shares over property and that CGT for the highest earners would still be two percentage points higher than it was at the end of Gordon Brown’s government, and for residential property and carried interest will remain at least 10 percentage points higher. David Kilshaw, private client services partner at EY, said the Chancellor’s cut to the headline CGT rates would be a “shot in the arm for the stock market, with investors in stocks and shares being the main winners”.

Osborne swayed by big banks over industry levy

Documents seen by the Times show that Barclays and HSBC lobbied the Government intensively in 2014 to ensure challenger banks paid a larger contribution to the £2.5bn-a-year banking levy, arguing that smaller players also posed a risk to the financial system. George Osborne announced last July that he would axe the levy by 2020 and replace it with a new corporation tax surcharge on any bank with profits of more than £20m, bringing smaller lenders and building societies into the tax. Smaller lenders are livid at the revelations. Paul Lynam, chief executive of Secure Trust Bank and the chairman of the representative group for challenger lenders, said: "Despite the fact that the empirical evidence shows small-bank failures don't cause systemic risks, we currently have the completely unacceptable position whereby taxpayers are subsidising the funding costs of the big banks and the small banks are subsiding the cost of the reduction in the banking levy."

Holyrood should abandon populist policies to tax the rich 

Writing in the Scotsman, David Watt, the executive director of the Institute of Directors Scotland, says he is surprised that all three of the main parties in the forthcoming Holyrood elections are promising a rise in the amount of tax people pay. He says MSPs feel bound to make the rich pay more, but forget there are as few as 12,000 top-rate taxpayers in Scotland, and they are “tax-savvy and mobile”. MSPs have not yet understood, he says, that the best way to get more tax from rich people is to create an environment that attracts more wealthy people. Claims that Scotland is a low-tax economy are disingenuous, he adds, and ministers should devise a long term economic strategy for Scotland and do costings for it. “That would allow some detailed planning and some certainty about business costs and provide clear direction for us all to follow.”

Canary Wharf and Inmarsat named in tax case

The Mail on Sunday notes that the Canary Wharf Group and Inmarsat were both named in a tribunal case HMRC won against bus owner Stagecoach this month. The firms are accused of using a complex artificial tax arrangement involving loans from one part of the group to another. Court papers said there were 11 cases besides the Stagecoach one and £179m at stake, and that a further £485m had been reclaimed from 16 other firms that had used similar arrangements.

HMRC targeting easy touch SMEs

HMRC gained an additional £470m in taxes last year thanks to investigations into the tax affairs of small businesses, while tax taken from large businesses fell by £500m, according to UHY Hacker Young. The firm said SMEs could come under greater scrutiny as HMRC looks to raise more taxes from soft targets.

Telephone surveillance market heats up

Deloitte is among a host of technology firms and professional services providers seeking to capitalise on the growth of "audio communications monitoring", as regulators clamp down on and institutions race to gain insights from automated analysis of sales calls. The systems work by recording and instantly analysing conversations to make them searchable by management and regulators. The global market for sophisticated telephone surveillance systems will nearly treble to £2.1bn by 2020, according to Deloitte, while the Telegraph notes that several London fintech start-ups are also competing for a share of the market.

FSB dispute over unopposed election of Cherry 

Members of the FSB have complained that the recent election of new national chairman, Mike Cherry, was "a highly politicised manoeuvre involving the ... manipulation of election rules". Some members are reportedly angry at governance changes that saw the board shrink in size and that the two alternative candidates to Mr Cherry were blocked from running. A number of senior federation officials have left over the changes, which they claim leave members with less influence, while others have been expelled. The FSB denies the claims and says the “elections were overseen by Electoral Reform Services to ensure the results are robust and the process is independent and transparent."

Late payment rules delayed 

New rules that require large companies to disclose their payment terms, including the average time taken to pay suppliers, have been postponed until October. They were due to come into force next month. Ian Cass, head of the Forum of Private Business, said he was disappointed about the delay but pleased the rules would still be implemented. “The publication of large firms' payment practices is key to stopping them using their size and buying power to bully small firms,” he added.

Soubry: Brexit a gamble we cannot take 

Writing in the Telegraph, Anna Soubry, the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise, outlines why she believes Britain should stay in the EU, covering issues including EU contributions, border control, access to the single market and trade deals. Ms Soubry concludes by saying that those who campaign to remain offer certainty while those pushing for Brexit only offer “risk at a time of uncertainty.”

PENSIONS

 

MPs: DWP must explain pension changes better

The Work and Pensions Committee has said that the DWP had failed to properly communicate how people will be affected by the new state pension. The new state pension replaces the basic and additional state pensions from 6 April. Under the new state pension setup the amount a claimant receives can be higher or lower than the £155.65 weekly rate depending on an individual's NI record. Around one third (32%) are expected to receive more after building up additional state pension under the current system. MPs called for the DWP to write to people who stood to receive less than previously expected and also set up a telephone hotline to deal with their questions.
