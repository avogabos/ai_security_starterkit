Brett please can you scan a copy of your passport and any bill showing your
address and forward it to to steve@formationshouse.com  so he can complete
the UK side of the company setup with us both as Directors.

Quicker if you just send it direct to him. Thanks.

Hi Robb

Thank you for sending the documents, they are fine.

However, we will also need documents for Mr. Brett LaMar, the 2nd director
on the company.

Please send us the documents as soon as possible or we can remove Mr. Brett
LaMar as company director (just keep him as shareholder) and process the
applications for:

- GRAMZ GLOBAL LIMITED
- GRAMZ UK LIMITED

Waiting for your reply.

Regards

Steve

Ok, Steve I am going to send you 3 separate emails with the passport copy,
and bank letter. I had to get the bank to type up a letter, because they do
have the owners address on statements, as they do not send out statements,
its all online viewable or bank book (which does not have address either).
The letter is not great English since most people here do not speak English,
but thats the best they could do. There is a phone number and your welcome
to call them to confirm this, or I could even give you my login information
for the bank so you can log in and see this is real.

I hope this is enough, if not, maybe we should just cancel and refund and I
will try a simpler option for setting up the company somewhere else.

Thanks mate,

Robb.

In case if you cannot send bills then you can send any latest letter from

your bank or latest bank statement or latest credit card statement for

address verification.
