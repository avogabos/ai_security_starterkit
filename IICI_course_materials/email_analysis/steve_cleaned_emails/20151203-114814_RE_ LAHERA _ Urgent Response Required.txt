Hi Steve,
 
I tried the online payment again, however, it did not work out. Still the
same error message appears. Hence I made a bank transfer from my German bank
acc. Please see attached pdf of transfer receipt.
 
Looking forward to the next step of the company formation.
 
Thanks, have a great day,
 
Ralf

Hi Steve,

 

Thank you for the confirmation details of the company formation application.
Attached are the requested documents (Passport and proof of residential
address).

 

In the online order process I used the credit card payment option. When I
pressed the pay button, the page did not advance further with any
confirmation or decline message. I have also checked my Formation House
account, but have not fond any clear statement if the payment went through
or not. Could you please let me know of the payment status, so, I can
rectify this immediately.

 

Thank you and have a great day,

 

Ralf Lehwald
