Hi Charlotte

Thanks for the update.

Can you confirm that you are just waiting for the share certificates to be
signed and the bank forms completed for the offshore accounts.

We have decided that both offshore accounts will be in Cyrus NOT Latvia as
we understand that is not a Cypriot bank simply a branch in Cyprus.

Regards
Chris

As soon as the account is open we will apply for VAT, as a bank account is needed.
The offshore accounts will get moving next week and we can get them open quickly if we have all paperwork. The issue is that the UK bank wants the papers for the LLP and the offshore want the same for the offshore. But it should be fine. Please confirm if both offshores will have Latvia accounts of one prefers the fbme

Re: Bank Statements
Hi Charlotte
Were you able to send the bank statements from Anthony to RBS?
Also, can you get back to me on the account status - has it been started?
I also need to know what has to be done to get the off shores accounts up and running.
We expect to be getting in funds at the start of July so we need all these accounts in place by then,
Finally did we ask you to register Advanced Cloud Solutions for VAT? This is required.
Thanks
Chris

In terms of the off shore accounts, I presume you need the share certificates signed and returned and the bank forms completed.
Is this correct?
Thanks
Chris
