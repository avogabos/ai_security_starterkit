Dear Delphine,
I understand fully and that's how I want it to be.
A prove of address can be any official documents showing the persons name
and address given shown. In that regards I sent you my passport copy, my
wife's passport copy in addition sent you a copy of my brokerage investment
account and you still ask for my banks details which I find unnecessary.
Now I enclosed herewith my Banks (Halifax) letter. I hope we can now get to
conclude this.

Dear Dr Bashir M Sani, 

 

Thank you for your email.

 

Please note the following:

 

1:After verifying your details I have noticed that you have allotted all the
shares in your company to the share holders.

 

Share Capital: 100 Million USD
Total Number of shares: 5000

Share Taken: 

Bashir Mohammed Sani: 70Million
Mrs Maryam: 30Million

 

 

Please note that under The Seychelles law (same as other IBC jurisdictions)
all shares which are "issued" must be fully paid up at least to par value
(i.e. by the shareholder paying in cash or other valuable consideration to
the company). Any "issued" shares not paid up are legally flawed and, for
example, would not have voting rights, etc.

As such, in the present case and based your present instructions, you will
need to pay up at least 100Million to the company.

We advice you that you can issue 1 share only, and can issue more shares
when required in future.

 

 

2: Please provide me with the proof of address for both directors on the
bank's letterhead.  You may hide the amount if you want.  

 

3: Please also mention which address I should provide the Seychelles
Registry for your accounts and minutes and resolution.  Our residential
address or do you require the Hong Kong Compliance Pack for 100GBP extra 

 

Regards,

 

Delphine

Dear Dr Bashir M Sani,

 

Unfortunately the company name Every Drop Foundation Inc. will not be
approved as the word "Foundation" is stated on the Registry's List of
Restricted Words. Kindly provide us with an alternative company name so that
we may forward same to the Registry for their further consideration.  

 

 

Thank you.

Although the name foundation appeared but its not a foundation its  just the
name of the company.
Thanks once again Delphine for taking the time to explain things to me.
