Hello Steve,

As I did not hear from your department setting up the appointment with OCBC for me I went ahead and took care of it myself as time is running out.   However after my visit in Singapore I received the email below in regards to the certificate of incumbency you prepared for us. (After the first copy never reached us I am the more disappointed with the incorrect information on the re-issued copy)
Could you please have this corrected as the certificate you sent us is not being valid?   
Thank you in advance.   If you could send a soft copy also by email to us and to Mr, Liang from OCBC after it was re-issued correctly that be great as I'm getting delayed again with the account opening which is not really ideal as my clients still wait to transfer payment for the past few month and we need to cover expenses from our own funds.

Thank you for your assistance

Dear Carol
I noticed that the information (namely the incorporation date) on the certificate of Incumbency differs from the certificate of Incorporation for Pashia Group Ltd. Thus, I seek your assistance to approach your
 company secretariat to make the necessary changes and reissue the corporate documents.
Kindly scan and send me a soft copy of it. Thank you.
