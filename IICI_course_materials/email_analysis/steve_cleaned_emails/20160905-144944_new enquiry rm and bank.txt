This lady is looking for a rm company with a bank account that also has a
foreign currency account

 

I don't have an up to date list, I believe nadya does but she Isnt in today
and therefore you may have to rely on your last versions

 

However the issue with this is the intended new diretir will not be uk
resident so we will have to see what to sell her

 

Please get in touch and find t more if possible and then liaise with nadya
to source one
