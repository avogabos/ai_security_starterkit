Fwd: About ordering ready made LLP
Dear Steve,
We have ordered from your company
incorporation services couple months ago. I think you have been talking with
our COO Mr. Antikainen before.
We have a new client who needs a
company which has been registered before 2014 to provide consultation services
for clients outside UK. Client has a Finnish passport and we helped him to get
a new tax residency from Republic of Georgia couple weeks ago.
We have suggested him to set up a
Scottish LLP and we noticed you are offering ready-made companies. He saw your
name list but wasn't happy any of names on the list so he asked how difficult
is to change the name of the company after the order?
Partners of this company will be our client
by himself as a private person and Novasigma Ltd (Gibraltar or Seychelles)
Could you please provide details what
this offer (£10.000) will include as the price is quite high comparing to many
other companies who are offering same type of packs? Is there going to be any
additional fees upon this or do you think our client will need extra services
from your company to get started with this company by offering his/this company
services as a consultant/sales person to the Georgian or Cayman entity?
We can have a phone meeting about
this case as our client is a bit in hurry so you are free to call me anytime.
Thank you very much.
