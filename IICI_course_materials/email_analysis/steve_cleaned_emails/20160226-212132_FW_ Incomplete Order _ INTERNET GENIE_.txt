Hi Delphine,

your last quoted price was 500 pounds

 

I would like to continue what we talked about some time ago, about incorporating

an offshore company.

 

 

Here is what I will need as the end result

 

1 company with the necessary original documents, and apostilled

documents, mailed to me.

 

 

2 bank account with internet banking in Geneve or another bank

that you propose, to be able to make operations from my office in Bucharest, Romania

 

3 accounts in usd and euro

 

4 debit cards attached to them

 

 

 

 

5 to explain me what has to be done yearly regarding accounting and tax,

and also provide me with the service to do that for me.

 

 

6 from what I know, since I will be a non rezident to the country we open the

company in, and since my business is internet marketing and affiliate commissions

(www.cashplane.com) which does not take place in that country,

I should not need to pay any kind of tax, or vat, please confirm

I am doing this business for 12 years now.

 

 

7 most important - since I am in hurry, I think we have the option to deliver me

a company already incorporated with bank accounts internet banking ability to 

recieve debit cards and everything I mentioned above, if this saves us a lot of time

please explain me this option.





 

8 I would like you to take care of all paperwork.

including the opening of the bank account.

 

 

 

 9 here is what I can provide

 

1 I can wire the money for what is needed

 

2 I can provide scanned id, home bills if necessary

 

3 I would preffer to not leave the country - Romania, Bucharest

  and get this done as fast as possible.

 

 

if you need anything else please tell me upfront to know if I can provide it 

or I can't

 

 

 

 

I am excited to get this going, please comment my each point

and lets go to step 1.

 

 

Sincerely yours,

Dorin

Hi Dorin,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

We will print out the documents from your online account and get them apostilled from the FCO - Foreign Commenwealth Office and send you by post.

The following documents will be apostilled:(Memorandum and Articles of Association, Form 10, Table A, Share Certificates, Register of Directors, Secretaries etc) 

Unfortunately we do not have any sample because we send all the originals to customers.

Hello Delphine

I am resending this email in case you did not get the previous one,

 

so my last question is this one

won't I be receiving the actual printed by you documents after they are apostilled ?

because I would find it strange to pay for the apostille and get scanned copies.

 

Those would be the documents that are going to get the apostille correct?

 (Memorandum and Articles of Association, Form 10, Table A, Share Certificates, Register of Directors, Secretaries etc) 



 

Can I view some samples?

 

Thank you Delphine your help is greatly appreciated,

Hi Dorin,

 

Unfortunately, we receive the remaining documents (Memorandum and Articles of Association, Form 10, Table A, Share Certificates, Register of Directors, Secretaries etc) 
electronically from Companies House which we upload on your account.  

 

You can choose to open the bank account in CIM Bank Geneva or FBME Bank Cyprus.  For both of banks, you do not need to go personnally to set up the account, we can do it online.

 

THe cost is 500GBP and it takes approximately 10-14 working days to set up the bank account.  And yes these banks provide ebanking.

Everything sounds good Delphine I will talk with my bank to see what they need exactly on Monday

already sent them an email.

 

One final question can't you send me the original remaining documents through DHL as well? - along with the apostilled documents 

(Memorandum and Articles of Association, Form 10, Table A, Share Certificates, Register of Directors, Secretaries etc) 

 

Also in case I want to open a bank account somewhere with you - without me comming personal

how much will that take? Will I have ebanking access? (I suppose I would)

 

How much will the company incorporation take?

 

 

Thank you

Dorin

Hi Dorin,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

The lowest price for Apostille is 150GBP and you will receive it in approximately 20 working days.

The price which I have quoted you (Apostille + DHL Courrier Charge - £365 (Obtained within 3 working days)) is the EXPRESS one and you get it in 3 working days by DHL Courier.

 

 

For bank account opening purposes, they usually require both Apostille and Certificate of Good Standing.

We do provide Certificate of Good Standing for 120GBP and this document will also be apostilled (along with the other company documents like Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association, Form 10) and sent out to you by DHL.  

 

 

Once your company is formed, we will send you the original Certificate of Incorporation by post.  The remaining company documents (Memorandum and Articles of Association, Form 10, Table A, Share Certificates, Register of Directors, Secretaries etc) will be uploaded in an online account for you to view and print accordingly.  

 

To keep your company dormant, you need to file Dormant Accounts (which we offer for 75GBP per annum) and also file the Annual Returns using Online Company Administrator 25GBP per annum.  

 

 

Please note that you require an address in the UK to incorporate the company.  We provide Registered Address Service for 25GBP and the address will be Suite B, 29 Harley Street , W1G9QR, London .

 

 

Regards,

 

Delphine

5 What will be the address of the company, after the 50 GBP incorporation?

 

Thanks
