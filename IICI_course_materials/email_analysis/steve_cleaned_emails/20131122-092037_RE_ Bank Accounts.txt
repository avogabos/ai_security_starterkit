Hi Chris

 

The issue is that RBS are responsible for updating Aleks, they have no
resposnbility to updating us. When I speak to Raj I always ask him to push
it forward and tell him we are dissatisfied. He has asked for all sorts of
additional documents for the seychelles companies and each time we have gone
out of our way (with no expenses to you) to provide what he asks for. The
account opening is an issue we cannot control. Our service is there is
assist throughout the process by providing what they ask for. Previously we
did not have issues with LLPs, but RBS appear to have changed their
compliance and are very slow to update us. Aleks should chase Raj to find
out what the issue is.

 

In terms of the fees we charged, we do not issue refunds when we have
consistently delivered the parts of the service we can. All I can suggest is
that the fees are perhaps recredited to use against the renewal fees next
year. 

 

I want your accounts to be resolved, but we are powerless in the banks own
internal operation. We will again attempt to get Raj to give us a clear idea
but he is slow to respond and as a result we aren't using RBS now for any
new accounts.

 

Thanks

 

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte

My email was not sent to Raj. I have never emailed him. My email was sent to
you as I wanted an update on all the bank accounts that we have paid to be
set up.

Aleks is in contact with Raj but he seems to be very slow we replying.

Thanks

Your email was addressed to Raj, I thought we were cc'ed. If Raj has not
responded please go to the branch as he isn't informing us of anything more
than the fact he is awaiting for address id. He said he had emailed you

 

Thanks
