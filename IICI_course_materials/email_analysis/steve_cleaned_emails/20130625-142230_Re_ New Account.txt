Dear Steve,

I do not know if Jeff told you but we had the following fixed prices (incl.
discounts) for the unique business addresses:

6  months – 230 EUROS****

12 months - 450 EUROS

You can pay via Paypal (we can make a unique link for each customer or you
can just send the payment to our address) or with a bank wire (we have
different accounts: Swiss CHF, Swiss Euro, German and British).

You can submit the order here: http://www.swissmaildrop.ch/ordermd.html or
simply send us the necessary information: the complete name (names) of the
customer and their forwarding address, the required city, forwarding
frequency, scanning option.

And last but not least: ALL of your customers MUST agree to our disclaimer:

*"I/we agree that this service is provided purely for receipt and
forwarding of normal commercial or personal correspondence. I specifically
agree that the service will not be used for the receipt or transmission of
any unlawful, illegal or immoral items.

I further understand that no medicinal product (whether prescription or
not) will be transmitted through your services. "
*

Please have it signed by the customer and sent to us scanned per email - we
have had enough problems with the local police because of dishonest
customers, so need to take care.


Best regards,
Elena
