Dear Steve,
Thank you for you assistance,
It seems Mr. Kuglow, from Rietumu, is currently in Brussels, and I should meet him, either later this afternoon, or tomorrow morning.
So, no need to courier me a new box. I very much appreciate your effort.
My kind regards to Charlotte,
Kind regards
Raphael

Dear Raphael Dayan
Please contact Rietumu and tell them that you have signed the
documents when you were at our office to collect the box, otherwise they will
cancel the device and issuing new device will take another 2-3 weeks.
Meanwhile we have sent the box to you by post which you will
receive today or tomorrow with a form. Sign the form and send it back to us.
Regards
Steve
