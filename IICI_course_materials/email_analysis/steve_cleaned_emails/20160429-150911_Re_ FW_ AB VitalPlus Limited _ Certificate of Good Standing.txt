Dear Raphael,
Â
Hope you are
doing fine.
Â
When we
processed the last Certificate of Good Standing for AB VitalPlus Limited, we
were asked to provide companyâs business activity and for AB VitalPlus
Limited we only mentioned business activity as Tradingâ. Now we have
received a request from the agent in Seychelles that company AB VitalPlus
Limited must provide detailed business activity.
Â
Please provide
us with a above mentioned information as soon as possible,.
Â
Regards
Â
Steveâ¦.
