Dear
Massimiliano
Iadecicco
The minimum requirement for UK company
is to have 1 shareholder holding minimum 1 share. Therefore for 1 company you
purchase only 1 Nominee Shareholder service and Nominee Shareholder holds only
1 share.
Please note that Nominee Services
are only available at the time of company formation. So, if you are thinking to
purchase Nominee Shareholder service for FROZEN  YOGURT LTD then it is not
possible.
If you require further information
or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone or by live chat on our
website.
