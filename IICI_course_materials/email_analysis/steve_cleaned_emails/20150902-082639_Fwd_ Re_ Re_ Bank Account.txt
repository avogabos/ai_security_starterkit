Thanks for your email below.

Kindly advise where does the concerned company be incorporated.

We would advise that whether the below situation can be processed by the bank for the bank account opening will be at the discretion of the Bank. We may only know their reply after we submit some documents and information to the Bank for review and assessment. Also, the nationality of director of the company is not the only critical point to decide, instead the bank will also look into the business activities, scope of services, and the countries that the company is operating the business, etc. when they are processing the bank account opening application. A detailed business plan of the company will be required to be submitted to the bank for review in most of the cases.

We are pleased to let you know that we have experienced in assisting client to open bank account with the Bank in BVI, Mauritius, etc. Our service fees will be ranged from USD900 to USD1,100, excluding other service fees on application of certificates from the Government or certified documents from the registered agent, etc.

We need to receive the funds before processing the said application. Kindly note that the said service fee will not be refundable even though the application is reject pied by the bank.

Therefore, kindly advise which jurisdiction that the concerned company belongs to and where you would like to have the bank account be opened.

Upon receipt of your direction, we shall advise you the relevant information accordingly.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks and regards
Polly
