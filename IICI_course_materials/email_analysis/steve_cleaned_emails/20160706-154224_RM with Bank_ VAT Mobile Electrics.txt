New RM for sale with Natwest Account and VAT

 

Mobile Electrics Limited

Has website domain Mobileelecs.com -  

 

Obviously can do a name change and sell the domain separately.

 

For Natwest, foreign director is ok but need address ID in english - so they
need to get a utility bill and preferable a bank statement notarised
translation into English, 

 

As its VAT too minimum sale is 10k but you should aim to sell at 12k.

 

 

There is also an option to retain the existing director on the business as
use as a Managed company - but remember the cost of the company is still
going to be 12k plus the managed service of 5.5k minimum as its vat managed
too

 

thanks

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kind Regards,
