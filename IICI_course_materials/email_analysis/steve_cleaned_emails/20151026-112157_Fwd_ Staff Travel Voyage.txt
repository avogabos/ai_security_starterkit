Hi Steve,

Phil is planning to issue some new shares of STV to a few new shareholders. He would like to provide a simple stock purchase agreement to each new shareholder. Do you have any generic stock purchase agreements that STV could modify for its use?

Thanks,

Paul

Hi Steve, my partner Paul
Hicket would like to request a standrad form for share diesperson, he will
reply here and appreciate if you can advise if you have such form in the
morning..
By the way any news re Cert of
Encomb form and when this is likely to be avail ?
Also I realise we are late with the renewal of the Staff
Travel Voyage Limted annual fee, just noticed, until when do we have to pay
this...can we have a couple of weeks?
Many thnaks
