Hi Steve,
As discussed, i want to apply for Tier 1 Entrepreneur visa. 

What i discussed was i have identified a partner who is running a company of used cars already . When i join him ,after i get Tier 1 visa, we plan to open car dealership of 40 to 50 cars . 

This should cover major amount. I don't mind paying 895 GBP plus 5000 GBP (for company opening process plus registering to eise) if you advise me to get Tier1 Visa keeping this existing company in mind. 

Please suggest if its suitable. I will call you anyways on Monday and shall meet you on friday if you send me your complete address. 

Regards
