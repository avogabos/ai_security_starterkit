Labour could scrap £50 note to fight tax evasion
Ed Balls has indicated that the £50 note would be scrapped under a Labour plan designed to clamp down on fraud and tax evasion. The shadow chancellor said that he would ask the Bank of England to examine whether there was a case for abolishing or redesigning the notes, which are notoriously exploited by criminal gangs because they offer a lightweight and compact option for moving large amounts of cash. During a speech in Birmingham, Mr Balls also pledged to make sure Britain would maintain the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7, although he did not rule out increasing it to more than 21%.

Cameron: Labour tax plans threaten jobs
David Cameron will today claim that Labour represents a threat to jobs because of Ed Miliband's plans for tax rises on businesses. The prime minister will argue that unemployment has fallen by 400 people a day under his government, and that it increased by 600 people under the first five years of the last Labour government. Mr Cameron will also say that a Tory government will guarantee the Employment Allowance for another five years, meaning one third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax.

Increasing the top rate may backfire
The Telegraph‘s Allister Heath says that tax rises will result regardless of who wins the election, but that targeting the top 1% of income earners can be damaging to the economy. Labour and the SNP are in favour of increasing the top rate of tax from 45% to 50%, and although HMRC believes this would yield £3.3bn a year extra, Mr Heath says there is also an argument that such a move would actually cut revenue by around £500m. He points out that the last time there was a 10% increase in top earners’ reported taxable income between 2009-10 and 2010-11, the total reported taxable income of the top 1% declined by 16.9%.

Agents reflect on IHT changes
The Times examines the implications of the Conservatives’ pledge to raise the IHT threshold to from £325,000 to £500,000 per person. Stephanie McMahon, head of research at Strutt & Parker, calculates that the proposed tax changes would have effectively eradicated IHT for 92% of all transactions last year. Meanwhile, Savills Lucian Cook states that 23% of estates on which IHT is collected are in southeast England, and therefore the plan to increase the threshold would be of the greatest benefit to homeowners in London and its hinterland.

Reprieve for investment bond holders
Holders of investment bonds who have overpaid tax on withdrawals could be able to reclaim money from HMRC following a court ruling last month. The upper tax tribunal upheld the appeal of a taxpayer who had accessed his money in a way that incurred much higher tax liabilities than would ordinarily have arisen. It ruled that the financial impact on the taxpayer was great enough that HMRC, which had refused to recalculate the man’s chargeable gains, should amend his liabilities.

Londoners back mansion tax
A YouGov poll has found the majority of Londoners are supportive of Labour’s proposed mansion tax on properties worth over £2m. Some 60% said they supported the idea, compared with 28% who didn’t. The Conservatives’ promise to raise IHT thresholds has also gone down well with London voters, with 56% thinking it a good idea compared with 26% who believe it is a wrong priority.

SME admin costing economy £4.7bn
A new report claims that small firms are wasting 28 hours a week on red tape and that an extra £4.7bn could be added to the economy if business owners were able to put this energy into growing their company. Amongst other points, the report from Creative Auto-Enrolment and the CEBR highlighted the switch to auto-enrolment, which takes up to 103 days for employers to implement. Auto-enrolment typically costs between £8,900 and £12,600 to implement for organisations with one to 100 employees.

Shore: Labour government bad for SMEs
Howard Shore, executive chairman of Shore Capital Group, warns that a Labour government could hamper SMEs. Writing in the Standard, he explains that proposed legislation such as the extension of paternity leave would be very disruptive to small businesses, particularly if they only employ a handful of people. He also voices concerns that Labour’s plan to increase the top rate of tax to 50% would act a “psychological barrier” to entrepreneurs.

Unanswered questions from Phones4u collapse
The Independent’s Simon Neville reflects on the collapse of Phones4u. He points out that this week’s complex report from administrator PwC has detailed a web of companies, woven via Jersey, as well as questionable loans by company directors. He also notes that banks, which were owed a total of £20m, got their money back in full while hedge funds, owed £430m, will have up to 24% returned. However, HMRC will receive nothing of the £78m owed.

TSB expands buy-to-let mortgage range
TSB Bank is expanding the sale of its buy-to-let mortgage range. The bank, which was formerly part of Lloyds Banking Group, previously sold its buy-to-let mortgages through its branches only, but this month began trialing an intermediary service through London and Country. It plans to roll out its buy-to-let offering to other brokers next month. The move will see TSB challenge existing buy-to-let lenders including Lloyds Banking Group through BM Solutions, Nationwide through its subsidiary The Mortgage Works, Coventry Building Society through Godiva, Yorkshire Building Society through Accord and the Post Office. TSB's buy-to-let rates start at 3.89% for a two-year fix with a £1,260 fee.
