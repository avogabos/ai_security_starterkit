EU tax transparency proposals inadequate, claim campaigners 

EU draft legislation designed to ensure large multinationals publicly disclose their earnings and profits has been criticised by tax justice campaigners as inadequate. According to the draft legislation seen by the Guardian, public disclosure of turnover, profits and numbers of employees will only be made compulsory for tax jurisdictions “within the EU”. Data for companies doing business in the EU, but with operations outside of it, will not have to be disclosed. “Not having to report on their operations for the rest of the world means that citizens will be in the dark about multinationals’ activities – unable to monitor where they are located, what they are doing and what they pay to governments in the form of taxes or other payments,” said Elena Gaita, EU policy officer for Transparency International. “According to conservative estimates, the EU is losing €50-70bn per year because multinational corporations are not paying their taxes. Hopefully, the European Commission will soon start to take this problem seriously and propose real solutions,” added Tove Maria Ryding, tax justice coordinator for the European Network on Debt and Development, representing a group of 46 NGOs.

ABI warns on pension tax relief complacency

Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, has warned MPs not to be ‘complacent’ about pension tax relief after the chancellor dropped Budget plans to overhaul the system. George Osborne did however unveil plans to introduce a lifetime ISA, which some experts have described as ‘stealth’ tax relief reform. Mr Evans told MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee that the pension ISA idea was not ‘off the table’, and suggested reform could still take place.

Closing the economic divide between millennials and baby boomers  

Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, explains in the Telegraph how the gap between millennials and pensioners could be bridged. He says the focus needs to be on generating more opportunity for the young as shifting wealth across the generations is unlikely to solve the issue. Giving young people a stake in the property market, through crowdfunding for example, is one idea backed by some, while others suggest a one-off stamp duty exemption for older people wishing to downsize. Flexibility over pensions and the means-testing of some benefits are also favoured. Finally, quality apprenticeship programmes can mean young people have the opportunity to enjoy the sort of success baby boomers had, says Mr Nicholson.

Income tax rise is ‘daft’ says Sturgeon

Scotland’s First Minister has said that increasing the top rate of income tax for Scotland's highest earners would be ‘reckless and daft’. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking during the final first minister's questions before the election. She has already confirmed that the SNP would not adopt UK government plans to raise the starting point at which workers’ pay the 40p income tax rate from about £43,000 to £45,000 next year. Meanwhile, Icas has called for a five-year roadmap for Scottish tax policy and urged politicians to make Scotland a more attractive place to do business.

Was Osborne’s tax bank raid justified? 

Peter Sharkey asks in the Birmingham Post whether cutting banks’ ability to offset earlier losses against current profits a second time was a step too far by George Osborne. He questions whether the move, which means that banks will now be able to offset only 25% of losses, down from 50% before the Budget and 100% two years ago, signals that the sector is still seen as an easy touch.

Smoothies should be taxed too, say experts 

Experts have said fruit juice and smoothies should be included in the new sugar tax after finding that some had twice as much sugar than required to qualify for the levy.

Creditors vote to support BHS rent cut plan

Creditors of BHS have agreed to a pair of CVAs for the retailer, which has debts of more than £1.3bn, including a pensions deficit of £571m. One agreement will see 47 stores pay a 50-75% reduction in rent while a plan involving 23 other stores was agreed in a separate deal. Despite the landlords' support, BHS has warned that it needs extra funding to trade beyond March 25th and it is trying to raise £100m. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, who oversaw the CVAs, said: "Today's 'yes' votes enables BHS to tackle the issue of an unsustainable lease burden which was weighing heavily on the business. While together, the two CVAs comprise only one element of BHS's plan to turn around its fortunes, they are a critical cog in the mechanism that will put the business in a stronger operational position.”

The role of accountants in fighting terror 

Peter Sharkey discusses the importance and popularity of forensic accounting, noting how Gordon Brown praised the profession following its work tracking the records of those suspected of being involved in the September 11th terror attacks. Forensic accountants, the apparent successors to 'financial crime teams', have become an important weapon in the government's burgeoning anti-terrorist arsenal, says Mr Sharkey.

Scottish legal firms upbeat but fear consolidation

There are too many lawyers and too many law firms in Scotland, a survey of the legal profession has found. Although Scotland's law firms report being "optimistic" about trading in the coming year, more than half of law firms north of the border have held merger talks in the last year and 37% think it is likely more firms will collapse, according to BDO.

Johnson: No risk of economic shock 

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has said that leaving the EU would result in no “economic shock” at all to the UK. He compared fears over an economic shock on the event of a Brexit to the concerns people had over the “millennium bug”, a much prophesied computer glitch which was set to wreak havoc as the world moved into the year 2000, but passed without incident. Mr Johnson said that “people would understand the consequences [of Brexit]”, adding that as with the millennium bug the nation will have “freaked out so much that it passed without the batting of an eyelid”.

IFS: Independent Scotland would be facing £10bn black hole

A new report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) shows a post-independence Holyrood would now be facing the need to raise tax or cut spending to fill a £10bn-plus black hole. David Phillips, an IFS researcher, said estimates for the UK budget deficit were slightly higher over the next couple of years, but smaller in both 2019-20 and 2020-21 as a result of tax increases and a continuation of austerity: “However in the case of Scotland, our projections are for a larger budget deficit in each and every year. For instance, our latest projections imply a budget deficit of around 9.4% of national income in the coming financial year, 2016-17, compared to 6.8% in our previous projections,” he added.

Bonus culture damaging businesses and the economy 

The Standard’s Anthony Hilton discusses the productivity problem facing the Chancellor, who is running out of money-raising options. Mr Hilton says it is the short-term thinking in boardrooms, driven by the lure of excessive bonuses, that has led to a reduction in investment. “This multiplication of substandard, profit-gouging businesses being run several notches below their optimum competitiveness severely damages the wider economy and goes to show that what is good for shareholders - higher profits - is not necessarily good for the economy and society as a whole,” he adds.
