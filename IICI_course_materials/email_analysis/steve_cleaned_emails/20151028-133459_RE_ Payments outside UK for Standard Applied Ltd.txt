Dear Customer,

 

If the company's management provides you consent in order to act on their
behalf, you can surely make the payment on company's behalf as agreed upon
the mutual consent between the agent and principal.

 

Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.

 

Regards,

The word 'DRAWINGS' here means design or architecture of machine that
company will manufacture. Here it does not mean that they are drawing money.

 

And he will get paid for making these machine drawings. So he wants to know
if following payment structure can work:

 

"My question is as the construction Company makes the drawings a will be
paid as we go. The Company is a Swedish Company. Can I pay as agent for
Standard Supplied Ltd. ? The invoice will be made in January with final
payment."

 

Please advice

Firstly, drawings cannot be done in a company. Instead, shareholders of the
company can withdraw the money in form of dividends. Also, transferring the
company's fund can be done either as remittance, payment of invoice etc
which solely depends upon the decision of company's management.

Dear S. Smith,

 

I am now in process of making drawings for a machine line for food
production. This will be final in january 2016 for application for a patent.

 

My question is as the construction Company makes the drawings a will be paid
as we go. The Company is a Swedish Company. Can I pay as agent for Standard
Supplied Ltd. ? The invoice will be made in January with final payment. Best
regards Anders Faye-Wevle
