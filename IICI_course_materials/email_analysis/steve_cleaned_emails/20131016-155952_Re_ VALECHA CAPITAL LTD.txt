Dear Charlotte,

I intend to use the existing registration of VALECHA CAPITAL LTD. Please do not cancel the registration or refund the charge of registering the limited liability company. 

I am still awaiting details of the sole proprietorship you have registered. Please inform me if you would like to deduct a charge for this registration. 

Upon receiving these details please mail a cheque with the amount you wish to refund to my company address.

Thanking You.

Regards,

Ajay
