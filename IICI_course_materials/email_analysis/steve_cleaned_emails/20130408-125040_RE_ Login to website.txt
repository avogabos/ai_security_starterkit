Hi Steve

Just to clarify we wanted one bank account to serve both Seychelles companies.

Is this possible?

Hi Chris


As confirmed by you previously, the bank account opening services is only available for GATEX and ADVANCED CLOUD SOLUTIONS LLP.


If you require we can place an order for bank account opening for MC CAPITAL at the costs of 500 GBP.


And yes you are required to fill in and finalize the bank account forms available in your account for your companies. Once you have finalize those we will then start the bank account opening process and keep you updated.


Regards

Steve

Hi Steve

Thanks for the login to the website, I have been able to login and access the various documents.

I notice that there is a section called Bank Form on the LLP Gatex but not MC Capital - is this correct.

I presume you need us to complete this - is this correct?

Apart from the Bank Account set-up is there anything else you need us to do.

Thanks
Chris
