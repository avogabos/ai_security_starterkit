Please email us the copy of letter received so that we can assist
you accordingly.
And please see the attach files regarding company status and filing
history and confirm that you received our message on 11-10-2017, the message
was as following:
Please note that your company SMARTCORPORATION-UK LIMITED is in bad standing
and company status is marked as 'Active — Active proposal to strike off' due to
non-filing of annual accounts. Company's First accounts made up to 30 September
2016 are OVERDUE because due date was 30 June 2017.
You need to file annual accounts and tax returns as soon as possible to avoid
company being strike-off. And if company was non-trading during the period then
you must file Dormant Company Accounts as soon as possible.
If you need our assistance for filing Annual Accounts and Tax Returns or
Dormant Company Accounts, the costs for OVEREDUE filing will be as following:
- Extreme Accounting (Trading Company Annual Accounts and Tax Returns) : GBP
500 plus VAT
- Express Dormant Company Accounts : GBP 150 plus VAT
Also you need to file 'Change of details of Director or Secretary' application
using the Online Company Administrator service to change directors address
because before you were using Company Privacy Protection and Director Privacy
Protection services which expired on 20-08-2017 and 05-09-2017 respectively and
you have not renewed these services.
Privacy services hides director's actual residential address instead it shows
our address as service address. Now that you have not renewed privacy services
then you must change directors address. If these addresses are not changed then
it will be an offence, if any official letter is sent to director will not
reach director which may cause problems for the company.
And now that CONFIRMATION STATEMENT is also OVERDUE, please submit
it as soon as possible.

Dear Mr. Steve,
Sorry for my delay for the reply to your messages, because I
was in most time on Business trip outside from Germany.
I have received a notification about some flat Penalty from
the Companies house regarding the Smartcorporation-UK.
However the Company is actually in Dormant Status.
I have sand some fulled documents AA02 Dormant company
accounts (DCA) with Date Approval of Accounts at 30.06.2017
The Documents were addressed to Compnies House Crown Way

Please find attached to the email the copies of the related
documents.
Is there any way to avoid the penalties(see your message of

I understand, that the TAX declaration will may be needed
independently if the company is in dormant status or not.
If so, I will need your help, please send me a Cotation of
