Hello,

Thanks for your email. I will wait good news about company status on HMRC.
Hope it will be resolved soon. Client is very nervous.

As for paying tax, i m waiting Reference Number of the company.
You should receive it from HMRS by post. Did you get it?
Please send me reference number of ATB CONSORTIUM.
When client will pay corporate tax, he will become calmer already ((

Thanks in advance.
