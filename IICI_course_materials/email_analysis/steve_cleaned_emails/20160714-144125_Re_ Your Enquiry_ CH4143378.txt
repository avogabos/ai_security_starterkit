Dear Sir

Re: PRO6 Limited    No 5881307

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file the following documents and fees:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual returns for 1 June 2013, 1 June 2014, 1 June 2015 and 1 June 2016, with a filing fee of £40.00 per form.

3) Accounts for the period ending 31 December 2012, 2013 and 2014.

4) The following late filing penalties:

£100.00 for the accounts ending 31 December 2007
£150.00 for the accounts ending 31 December 2008
£9.57 for the accounts ending 31 December 2009 (the penalty was £150.00 but £140.43 has already been paid)
£300.00 for the accounts ending 31 December 2010
£750.00 for the accounts ending 31 December 2012

There are no late filing penalties for the later accounts as they became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

5) A waiver letter from the Government Legal Department, which can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

Yours faithfully
