Dear All Team

 

Today is our business start to 2016

 

Our company has been through many changes last year, aside from losing our
figurehead, we have changed direction in our technology and made real
improvements in our future outlook of the business.

 

I am aware that the last 3 months has been fairly silent from myself and my
brother Darius in terms of management interaction and I want to highlight
some of what we have been working on so you can have confidence that company
is entering into new stages of success:

 

Cameroon - signed land contracts and existing agriculture zone setup ready
for exporting and business. Preliminary agreements to implement a change in
law to give us even better terms and business flexibility, and a meeting
pencilled on the 25th of January to meet the president and get the new law
into the gazette. Additionally we will have the contract to roll out a Beta
Test of our NAC program - this is our flagship Infini Solution, we always
focused on the Commerce Registry but what these countries want is citizen
upwards change  

 

Gabon - They would like us to implement a new Financial Zone right between
the airport and the capital city. Will be a copy of Gambia in all ways
except there will be an official gazette and this zone will not have the
political issues of Gambia. Additionally they are keen to discuss an
implementation strategy for the NAC . we are meeting the heads of Homeland
Security and the Vice President in the week commencing 18th January 2016, we
have been requested to bring all contracts with us. 

 

Mali - They would like us to replicate the Cameroon project entirely in
March.

 

Niger - we are planning some visits and discussions for February, they have
a definiate need and want for our NAC solution and added to that they want
to imprve their Doing Business ranking nd so we will also be putting in a
Commerce Registry 

 

EG - Same as Cameroon

 

Comoros - Same as Gabon 

 

These are real projects that will be successful. None of the above projects
are in early stages, they are all in contract stage and Cameroon is signed
and we are starting delivery.

These projects do not create income for us immediately and actually cost us
to initiate but we have been talking to a number of large investment firms
and they are all showing strong interest in investing in business like this.
We will be securing a large investment in the first quarter of this year and
this investment will allow us to refresh all our equipment, take on more
staff and award bonuses to all existing staff.

 

Salaries, Bonuses and Commissions

 

We are behind on the staff payments, but rest assured all is being brought
up to date very soon. 

Its difficult to explain but the process here with Probate and accessing
business accounts has meant much of the company cashflow was locked and we
are only now starting to receive the merchant payments into the accounts and
access my fathers other business accounts. Its been slow and we will remedy
this and make it all back on track. For those who have worked for us for
years, you know we have always made good on our word and have supported our
staff well over the years. We asked for some understanding during the
transition and we are nearly at the end where everything has been handled
and moving onto our names alone.

 

Formations House:

The website has been updated and slowly we are bringing all our sister sites
up to date in the same format. We are now able to restart our marketing
campaigns as previously the content and product range was not attractive to
todays formations market.

Relations with Mayfair in Seychelles are restored but I would like us to
focus on pushing more Belize formation services as it is a better option for
most. 

Hong Kong remains strong and we now understand the procedures even more

UK is still a good market for us but we need to focus on the accounting
services as an extended service as we can provide real value here if we do
it right.

 

In all 2016 will be a turning point in the company history, we will move
from being a middle market formations agents with excellent technology to
being a leader in government automation. The contracts are coming and we
will be doing a lot more PR. 

Every member who has ridden our ship to success will share in the proceeds
of our success.

 

I wish each and every one of you a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year. I
am proud of our company and proud of my staff. 

 

Warmest Regards

 

Charlotte, Darius and Danielle
