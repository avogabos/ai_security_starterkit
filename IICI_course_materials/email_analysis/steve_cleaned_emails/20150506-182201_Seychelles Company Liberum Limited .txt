Hi,


Company Name: Liberum Limited
Order no. 184379
Certificate of Incumbency


Customer has ordered Certificate of Incumbency for the above Seychelles
Company, I contacted AC Management they said "Only the current agent can
issue certificate of incumbency".

Please advise are we going to prepare the incumbency for this company, as he
needs it for the Bank purpose.
