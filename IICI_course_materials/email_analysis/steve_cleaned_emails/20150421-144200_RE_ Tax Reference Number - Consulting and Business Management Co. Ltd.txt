Dear Steve,
thank you so much for your answer.  Actually I don't need the TRN.
But your support centre was asking me for it!  I'll forward you the mail
they sent to me.

Thanks again and regards

Dear Sirs,
we have not the number you're
asking for. Our Company is a dormant start-up Company and the return you're
filing is the first due. We also have not correspondence with the HMRC. We just
have two numbers: the Company number and the Auth Code and we gave you both.
Sincerely yours
Edoardo Figliolìa
