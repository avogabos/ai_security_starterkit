You need to ask them specifically how they're taking these funds/why they
aren't taking them via the apple app store/google play store like other
mobile games. 

what security we have via the payments ie. What information is being taken
from them at checkout phase. 

 

We also need to see their website.

Can you look intot he company itself and see whether they would have to use
on the the games sites to take online payments etc, as I don't understand
otherwise how,, unless its merchant card processed?

Re: On Daily basis : 50-75 invoices between GBP 5-1000, total daily
collection GBP 3500-5000 - where are the payments coming from? And what for?
How do they sell their services

 

They will be running a online simulation game for managing green
environment.

 Products and services will be game coupons, virtual products to manage
green environment, they kind of stuff they sell for all other online
simulation games. And it is an online game, so many can come from anywhere
in the world.

Business Activity: startup company for online simulation game for managing
green environment

 

2 directors, Pakistani nationals, one director resident of Canada and other
of Pakistan.

 

 

 

Need UK company registration, bank account, mailing address and annual
filings services

 

 

For UK bank account then can visit UK- they will have to but unless they
have an exiting barlsays or hsbc relationship its going to be hard as they
don't live here,

 

Otherwise they may go for Euro Pacific, can Euro Pacific receive online
payments via PayPal or any other service providers? Europacific are red
flags on Pakistan, however they will look at it and see, but its tricky

Maybe be better they stick with the Canada one, and have a private legal
agreemet for the other, and later add him as a shareholder

 

 

 

Also have shown interest in Managed Company Service. Through our Collection
Service can we handle:

 

-          On Daily basis : 50-75 invoices between GBP 5-1000, total daily
collection GBP 3500-5000 - where are the payments coming from? And what for?
How do they sell their services

 

-          How much time we will take to transfer payment to his account,
can it be done on daily basis? 7- 14 days clearance, but can be daily.
Really depends on where its from and we will what to see invoices and id
docs in some cases to for the people remitting funds,

 

 

 

Please advice
