Steve... here are two+ very important dates for your company diary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear SteveKeeping you fully up to date about the Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements
of the Companies Act 2014

In this month's Ezine I'd like to draw your attention to not one but...
...two+ very important company legal administration dates in 2016.

Could I urge you to mark both of these dates in your diary now,  immediately, while
they are both fresh in your mind.

You see, both of these dates relate to an important decision that affects just about
ALL existing Irish registered private companies that are limited by shares.

* Your first date for your diary is the 31st August of this year
- which is closer than you might think.

* Your second date for your diary is three months later, on the 30th November of
 this year, and this is a deadline date which Companies Registration Office (CRO)
in Ireland has warned everyone not to overlook!

So important are these two dates in relation to your Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements of the Companies Act 2014,
that I'd added an extra calendar page below for your consideration.

My reason for including this extra call-to-action calendar page is because some 
days ago Companies Registration Office (CRO) in Ireland warned that as we get closer
to the  30th November 2016 deadline the expectation is that there will be a gigantic
upsurge in the number of applications being submitted for processing - so much so
that CRO may not be able to process all of them in time to beat the cut-off deadline
of the 30th November.

Whatever you do, don't let this happen to you or to any limited company that you
have a responsibility for... or an interest in.

With such important changes happening this year, I'd particularly like you to know
that you are very welcome to call either myself or my colleague, Sue Jesper, on 
01 664 1111 or email Sue on sue@formations.ie [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001_fAcsLikRPVDR2Hm3a6gE2RGYPJusfzgCzbP9rCQW2jlrFIUJACdfey7a_Q7fWn2cl4PqctYF0ZBgQAbdjJGOvD1424oWLT_pKmzpTC836QFblIJZybuVHyq-f87fIszfLN64PxEnVyQpz2P4_lC7811_8ZAcMGavxj37WYS_ZM=&c=yzAeWPOjkZXGV82V3TDEqvbOlOly6Ix-i3h9Hh-b6PFj87A9izzCGw==&ch=qCUDCOjtfBiAtfPQCi0OOqQcsS9UWKDcyekVex0IQQ8o6-wMLp8YmA==]and we'll give you all the help and advice you need.

Yours sincerely,

A brief summary of what is happening + a very useful Fact Sheet for you
With the introduction of the Companies Act 2014 on 1st June 2015, all existing private
companies limited by shares, have to decide whether they wish to be a DAC or opt
 in to being the new simplified LTD.

If no choice has been made by a company as of 30th November 2016, they will automatically
be converted to an LTD.  However, failure to take action prior to this date may 
result in a corporate form that is unsuitable for the business of your company, 
and indeed may be deemed as a breach of the Directors' duties.

In order to help you decide on the best option for your company, we have put together
a fact sheet on the conversion process, together with a snapshot of the main differences
between a DAC and an LTD.  We can also provide you with guidance and paperwork in
order to convert to your desired company type in advance of the deadlines.
Click here to view our Fact Sheet

With conversion packages to LTD from as little as ?189* + vat per company (*Discounts
for multiple companies are available)  it makes excellent economic sense for you
 to contact us to see how we can help with a cost effective and efficient solution
for all your conversion needs.

NOW
is perhaps the best time of all for you to attend to the necessary secretarial work
to convert your company.

a hearing in the High Court.

Dear Steve,
Keeping you fully up to date about;
District Court Orders to extend
Annual Return filing dates
When the Companies Act 2014 introduced a mechanism for companies late in filing their annual returns, to make an application to the District Court to have their time to file extended, there was
huge initial interest
.
After all, the granting of such an Order would result in
no loss of audit exemption
and
no penalties
having to be paid... a win-win for any company finding themselves missing their ARD!
However in May 2016 the CRO advised that the Registrar was reserving the right to object to any application in the District Court.
Now, nine months on from this, we have certainly seen a substantial impact, with objections being raised by the CRO in many of the applications that are lodged.
Where the Registrar comes across applications, which in their opinion include reasons in the Affidavit that do not explain or verify why it was not possible to deliver the annual return to the CRO within the time permitted, they
WILL
be objected to.  Unless those objections can be successfully countered, then the applications will not be successful.
As you can imagine, this can prove a costly exercise for applicant companies to undertake to ultimately find themselves back to square one and having to bear late filing penalties and the cost an audit for two years!
The good news is that, together with invaluable input from our legal team, in all the cases where we have acted and where the companies were able to provide additional documentation to verify the facts of the case,  the objections made by the Registrar were effectively countered and the cases brought to a successful conclusion.
If you would like to discuss any potential case, then please do not hesitate to contact myself or Sue. We will be delighted to speak with you.
We have also produced a a Factsheet on this topic and it is available by clicking

Yours sincerely
