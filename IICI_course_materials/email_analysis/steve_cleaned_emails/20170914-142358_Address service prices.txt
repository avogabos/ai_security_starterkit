Dear Sales/ Support

 

Couple of big changes to our pricing and services.

 

Firstly, we must start charging VAT on all sales. On our website we will
display Excluding VAT pricing for now, and the VAT will be added at
checkout. Over the next couple of weeks VAT will be shown on each product
page, and at checkout it will be included for the majority of customers.

Where we have EU VAT registered business customers (i.e. a reseller/
accountant based in an EU country with their own VAT number) we will amend
the system to Zero rate the VAT.

 

VAT cannot be included on any sales reports (this VAT money is to be sent to
HMRC quarterly)

 

Going forward we will make it clear on each page, and use it as an
opportunity to upsell VAT registration and then VAT accounting services.
Upselling is key and understanding that VAT is a cashflow problem for many
people will help you sell it. thanks

Address services:

1.	Virtual Mailing Address

a minimum term of 3 months.
b.	Customer can pay upfront for 1 Year at £250 (plus VAT)

2.	Directors Service Address (price per person, regardless of director
or shareholder)

a.	Annual only £50 (plus VAT)

3.	Registered Address Service

1.	Virtual Mailing Address

a.	Annual only £500 (plus VAT)

2.	Registered Address

a.	Annual only £200 (plus VAT)
b.	Same for DPS.

 

Any customers who renewed in the last 3 months may contact us and ask for a
refund as they have been moved the 85 GPS and this is cheaper than the
service before, we will offer to extend the renewal they paid for to cover 2
yrs instead of 1 (which saves them some money) or if absolutely necessary we
will refund the difference only.

Customers who wish to move to Harley street premium will need to pay the
difference to do so. (aside from a couple of selected customers I have
already agreed)

 

Additionally we are updating our Accounting Packages to be more in line with
what many businesses need, and the package options are  displayed in the
attachment

Please also see the following links on our website. These are for LTD
companies and note the fees on the basic if they do not provide the receipts
in a bookkeeping method (ie give us manual receipts).

You need to also always remind company directors that its mandatory to  file
self assessment as a shareholder or director.

For the incorporation we are bringing our offers more in line with what
others do and will have 3 packages available. 

You will need to be sure on each and read the content properly once its on
the website.

 

Im sure the pricing will be a question and you may feel we underprice but we
need to start attracting new customers and upselling on the address and
accounting services.

 

Nominee Secretary service will also be changing and become a stronger sale
product as before it wasnt fully clear why and how its important for most
customers.

 

The webchat is showing good promise and we need to ensure the response is
fast but more importantly the response is personable and also correct, so
over the next few weeks we will provide some guidelines for response to
help.. 

 

Phone VO is still down but we can if required sell 0203 numbers, I am
working on getting the existing numbers back but its really more complex
than I thought.

 

Hopefully this clarifies the address service changes.

Other pricing and product changes will be provided soon, though some
products like Nominee Director will not be available in the checkout process
and will be hidden products only supplied as a link once we can agree to
provide the service on a case by case basis.

thanks
