                (Urgent Response Required)
Dear Account
          Centre,
Please clarify:
Does  the company  need to file its Final statutory accounts
          and
          final Tax return before sending the form DS01 to Company
          House?
When company's bank accounts should be closed? Before filing
          accounts?
Thank you,
Aksana.
