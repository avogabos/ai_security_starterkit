Hi Radu,

 

Thank you for your email.

For UK Companies, you pay corporation tax.  Ou can find the details on
www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/

 

We also provide Nominee Director Services for Offshore Company Formations,
like Seychelles or BVI which are tax free jurisdictions.

 

Regards,

 

Delphine

Hello Delphine

What is the cost of the UK company with UK account and nominee services?

The UK option may interest me and some of my clients if the company is tax
exempt for income derived outside the uk and if the cost is reasonable.

Will wait for price

Thank you

Radu Victor

Hello Radu Victor,

 

Thank you for your email.

So you will appoint your own director/shareholder for the Hong Kong Company?

 

If that is the case, then yes, you can do that, and they can come to Hong
Kong for the meeting with HSBC. We will arrange for everything.  

Because unfortunately we do not provide Nominee Services who will open the
bank account for HK Companies. (However, we have this option for UK Company
with UK Bank and Local Nominee Director who will open the bank account
without your presence, if that might interest you)

 

If you need more details, please do not hesitate to email me or call me.

 

Regards,

 

Delphine
