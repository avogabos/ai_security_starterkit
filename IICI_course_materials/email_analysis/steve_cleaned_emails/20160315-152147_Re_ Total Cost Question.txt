Hello Steve,

Thank for the complete reply.

About bank account, I only want to open a bank account exclusively in SEPA
zone and in priority if it's possible in Hellenic Bank Cyprus. About
company if it's possible in first chance in Delaware company or only in
second chance in Belize company. If the bank account is out of the SEPA
zone I'm not interested to open a offshore company.

Can you try to informs with them if you can open for me (for a European
Citizen) a Delaware Offshore Company with Hellenic Bank Cyprus?

Waiting you reply.

Thank you.

Dear
Messias Carvalho
Thank
you for your email.
Please
note that bank account is not in Cyprus. Bank account will be processed with an
offshore bank in St. Vincent Islands.
Following
are the answers to your queries.
1.
For
Belize offshore companies, t
here is no requirement to file any accounts or to
provide annual audits reports.
2.
Annual
company registration cost is GBP 500. You will pay us for company registration renewal.
3.
Offshore
bank account service and annual charges you will pay directly to bank. Once
bank account is opened then you will directly deal with bank yourself.
4.
Registered
Address in Belize will be assigned to company but you cannot use the address
for mailing purpose nor you can mention registered in company documents such as
invoice. On company documents and for mailing purpose you must use your actual
trading address for example you should use your address in Portugal.
5.
Regarding
taxation issues, since for Belize company you are not doing any annual filings
therefore there is no finance paper. Obviously you will be managing company
finances with company’s bank account, therefore for tax calculations you can
use company’s bank account statement. For better advice on this issue please
consult a professional accountant.
And
we can register a Delaware company for you for GBP 500, but most of the bank
nowadays are reluctant in opening bank account for USA companies, nationals and
residents.
If you require further information or assistance you can contact
me at

Re: Total Cost Question
Hello Steve,
Thanks for the reply.
I have really idea to go forward with the Belize offshore company + Cyprus bank
account.
I have a few questions:
1. What I need to send specifically to formations house every year to renew the
company licence? Every year I need to show the total invoiced of the business
to renew? I receive from Belize authority the certificate of the total of the
year for individual tax's reasons in my country? I know I don't pay tax's in
Belize but in my country Portugal, I need to pay tax's of the individual
profit's from for example this company of Belize. How can I receive an official
Belize paper with what I total invoiced to show the Portuguese authorities to
pay my individual taxes? Because in my country I need to pay about 28% to 35%
of tax of the total I win of every activity. And I need papers to show the
authorities the money comes from that company and that bank account and it's
legal company and legal money. You get I try to explain to you?
2. What is the cost of renew to pay to you for renew my licence company Belize?
3. I have year renew costs to pay to you because the Cyprus bank account?
4. My company will have a address in Belize for invoice proposes?
5. The Delaware Offshore Company with a Cyprus Bank Account is really a
problem? Because in first I prefer the Delaware, only if is a problem I choose
Belize. Because I think for personal tax reasons in Portugal, maybe I don't
have problem with USA Company and maybe I will have problems with Belize
Company. You have experienced with Portuguese costumers with Belize Companies?
Waiting your feedback.
Thanks.
