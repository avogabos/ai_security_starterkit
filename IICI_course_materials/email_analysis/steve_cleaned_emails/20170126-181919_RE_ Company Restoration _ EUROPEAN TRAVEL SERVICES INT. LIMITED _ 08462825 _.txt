Dear Steve, 

 

thank you for Your email and efforts to resolve the matter and I appreciate the gesture. 

 

I just hope that everything works out in the tamest time.

 

I should have  one request, it is possible to please send apostiled document for my company Diplomatic Protection Service ( in the annex) , 

the bank does not want to open an company account  without this apostille – exactly this one via enclosure  . How long would it take to arrange this apostiled document? It's urgent. 

 

Thank you again 

 

Paul

HI Pavel,

 

We have just spoken with Companies House, Annual Accounts which we sent to Companies House last Friday should have reached Companies House on Monday but due to known reasons it is still in transit with the postal service.

 

Unfortunately we are bound to send these documents by post and now we have to wait until Annual Accounts are delivered which we are hopeful should be done in 2-3 working days. We will contact Companies House again on Monday for an update

 

I highly appreciate your patience in this regard and honestly in my 15 years of experience this is first time I am facing such a delay.

Dear Paul

 

Please confirm for period ending on 31-March-2016 you want to file trading accounts and tax returns or we can submit Dormant Accounts?

 

Since Companies House is not giving a definite answer but I am thinking, delay in restoration could be the reason that for above mentioned period filing is now due since 31-Dec-2016. I thought company will be restored before the due date but that did not happened.

 

Please give me confirmation about the above filing and I will see if it will effect pace of restoration process.

Dear Steve,

 

I have to again ask you , again turn to request what is actually happening in the case of the renovation of the European Travel Service Int. 

 

Your last report was that within 3 working days, the company will be ok. Now this is, again, much more days and still no report or letter from Companies house.

 

The whole operation takes  aprox. 2 months. It's been a really long time and not a single report about the outcome or the process. 

 

I'm asking you nicely, it is possible to find out what's going on? 

 

This causes me great trouble. Approaching the deadline for taxes and I can't send the tax statement behind disolved company  

 

Once more I ask for help to send  a reminder to Companies House . pls.see enclosure 

 

Thank you

 

Best regards

 

Paul

Dear Steve,
thank you for Your email and efforts to resolve the matter and I appreciate the gesture.
I just hope that everything works out in the tamest time.
I should have  one request, it is possible to please send apostiled document for my company Diplomatic Protection Service ( in the annex) ,
the bank does not want to open an company account  without this apostille – exactly this one via enclosure  . How long would it take to arrange this apostiled document? It's urgent.
Thank you again
Paul

HI Pavel,
We have just spoken with Companies House, Annual Accounts which we sent to Companies House last Friday should have reached Companies House on Monday but due to known reasons it is still in transit with the postal service.
Unfortunately we are bound to send these documents by post and now we have to wait until Annual Accounts are delivered which we are hopeful should be done in 2-3 working days. We will contact Companies House again on Monday for an update
I highly appreciate your patience in this regard and honestly in my 15 years of experience this is first time I am facing such a delay.

Dear Paul
Please confirm for period ending on 31-March-2016 you want to file trading accounts and tax returns or we can submit Dormant Accounts?
Since Companies House is not giving a definite answer but I am thinking, delay in restoration could be the reason that for above mentioned period filing is now due since 31-Dec-2016. I thought company will be restored before the due date but that did not happened.
Please give me confirmation about the above filing and I will see if it will effect pace of restoration process.

Dear Steve,
I have to again ask you , again turn to request what is actually happening in the case of the renovation of the European Travel Service Int.
Your last report was that within 3 working days, the company will be ok. Now this is, again, much more days and still no report or letter from Companies house.
The whole operation takes  aprox. 2 months. It's been a really long time and not a single report about the outcome or the process.
I'm asking you nicely, it is possible to find out what's going on?
This causes me great trouble. Approaching the deadline for taxes and I can't send the tax statement behind disolved company
Once more I ask for help to send  a reminder to Companies House . pls.see enclosure
Thank you
Best regards
Paul
