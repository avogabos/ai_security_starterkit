Steve,

Also, Just wanted to let you know that before making the payment  want to
add another director (Mr. Sk Jahangir) as you said that I can add a
director at any time I want.

But when I'm logging into my dashboard, I no more see an option to add
another director. Please help.

Regards,
Pratik Roy

Steve,
As you can see that I tried
thrice but it's not going through. I have put in the exact address as it is
there on my card statements but still it's not going through.
A quick question, Can I use my
dad's credit card? We have the same address.
