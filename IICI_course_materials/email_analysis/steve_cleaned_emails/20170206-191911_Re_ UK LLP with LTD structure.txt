Dear Customer



Thank you for your interest in our services.



Please note that in UK private limited company it is now mandatory to have a human director therefore you will not be able to achieve required company structure. To achieve it you will need to 2 private limited companies and 1 limited liability partnership.



You can register 2 private limited companies by appointing human director and shareholder and register 1 limited liability partnership. The details for this structure are as following:



UK LLP must have minimum 2 members/partners. Each member can be setup as a UK LTD company or an Offshore LTD company, each with a single director and shareholder (your director and shareholder). Each company can have its own bank account.



A Limited Liability Partnership, LLP, is a type of business entity registered in the UK. Like a Private Limited company (LTD) it is considered as a corporate body with a separate legal entity. In addition, the liability of its members is limited to their contributions only.



The primary difference between an LLP and an LTD is that a UK LLP can operate as “Fiscally Transparent”. This means that any taxes on profits are levied on the members of the Partnership and not on the Partnership itself. The rate of tax levied on the members of the partnership is dependent upon each member’s tax residency. This can become a significant advantage if the members of the partnership are tax resident in a low or nil tax jurisdiction as profits can be redistributed tax efficiently. (if members are offshore companies)



Limited Liability Partnerships do not have directors and shareholders, they only have partners. Each partner can be given limited liability and can be protected from responsibility or liability for another partner’s misconduct or negligence. All partners have the right to manage the LLP and at least 1 partner must be designated as the Nominated Partner.



In addition, an LLP may open a bank account and apply for a VAT number. To open the account with UK bank, the bank will request the Nominated member to be present (or the director of the corporate body acting as nominated member), in some cases the bank will want all members present. Alternately you have an account with offshore bank in Saint Vincent Islands were member/s presence is not required.



The UK members can also operate as businesses in their own right.
