Hi Oliver

To add to my last email i understand GBC2 Offshore Companies require a registered address in Gambia does this come with the fee for the formation? and is there any ongoing fees?

In terms of The IBC is required to file abbreviated accounts annually and has the option to pre-pay any tax liability in advance at a reduced rate. Do you provide a service that can file the accounts to the requirements? If so what are the annual fee's?

In terms of the merchant account is the timescale on this please? and who is the provider we currently have a merchant account with the bank of cyprus for another activity so would not like to have it with the bank of cyprus, would be good if a company in cyprus but if not that is ok?

Cheers

Looking forward to your response keen to get this arranged ASAP

Hi

With the formation in Gambia at present i have two companies and am a sole trader with a VAT number in Cyprus. I wish to separate my business activities as there two completely different companies. One company is a newspaper the other a TV subscription service provided globally.

I would like to create a separate legal entity for my TV subscription service offshore and continue with the newspaper as a sole trader in Cyprus.

I presume this is OK? and can be done with an offshore company in Gambia?

I understand the banking facility will be with FBMA Bank in Cyprus ?

Will the merchant account also be with FMBA Bank in Cyprus ?

Can you send me more details on the process with timescales and what is required.

Regards
