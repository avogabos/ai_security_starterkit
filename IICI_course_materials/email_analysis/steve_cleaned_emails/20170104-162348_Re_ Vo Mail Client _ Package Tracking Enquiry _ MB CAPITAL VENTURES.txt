Dear Steve,

Thank you very much for your prompt response.
As I am not aware of that procedure kindly tell me how do I do this as I might miss important mail this way!
I also need to know if you have received another result envelope from De Grisogono for me as they told me they sent it a month ago and no one has notified me of that. I guess back then my 'wallet" had sufficient funds but no one forwarded the envelope which I gather has been lost by now!

Kindly tell me how to pay so that I can receive my package at home.

best regards

M.

Dear Steve,
Happy new year!
I am attaching something that was sent to our office address
at Harley street it has been signed for and it was never forwarded to me as
well as an envelope from De Grisogono jewelry one month ago.
Please be kind enough to tell me who received my items and
why have I not been notified? I thought that everything received would be
forwarded to me at home in Faringdon. I am paying for his service right???
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Maria
