Hi Phil
Good to see you yesterday.
Further to our chat about Direct Plus Ltd in order to file dormant company accounts I need the Companies House authentication code.
If you don’t have this the option is to either for you to request the information from Companies House or just to go straight into the process of having the company struck off.
I really don’t feel that it is important but the decision is yours.
Best
