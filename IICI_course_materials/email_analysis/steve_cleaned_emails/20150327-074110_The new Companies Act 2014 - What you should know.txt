Dear Steve,
The genesis of this new Companies Act 2014, which is the largest in the history 
of the State, can be traced back to the establishment of the Company Law Review 
Group in 2000.
The CLRG was mandated to make recommendations on the updating, consolidation and
 simplification of company law in Ireland to bring it up to world class standards.

This was achieved by shifting the emphasis of company law away from Public Limited
Companies and on to the workhorse of Irish commercial life, the Private Company 
Limited By Shares. It was further achieved by a re-ordering of existing law into
 a more logical and user friendly format, along with the introduction of a number
of common sense innovations.

The most frequent comment made is that this Act is 'old wine in a new bottle'. Accordingly,
all of your existing company law knowledge is not entirely lost, but rather re-packaged
and made easier to access.

However, to adopt this approach to the new Act would be to do so at your peril! 
Whilst consolidating the provisions of existing legislation, it also introduces 
new and innovative measures to reflect, in many instances, the practicalities of
 the times we live in. Now, more than ever, the need for professional support is
 of paramount importance.

In the section below I have carefully outlined the different aspects of the Companies
Act 2014 for your consideration.

If you see anything in there which you would like to know more about, or would like
to discuss with me in more detail, please don't hesitate to pick up the phone and
call me, or email me directly at sean@formations.ie.

I'll be delighted to hear from you

Yours sincerely,
