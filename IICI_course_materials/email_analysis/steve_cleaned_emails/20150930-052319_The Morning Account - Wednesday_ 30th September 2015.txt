Deloitte looks to remove recruitment bias
The Mail expands on plans announced by Deloitte to introduce blind interviews as part of moves to prevent discrimination against those from deprived backgrounds. Background information on education and exam results will be denied to interviewers until a job offer is made. The firm will also use 'contextual' data to identify candidates who have excelled in challenging circumstances. Deloitte said the blind interviews will ensure that job offers are made on the basis of “present potential, not past personal circumstance”. However, Alan Smithers, professor of education at Buckingham University, said: “There's an element of social engineering here. The emphasis should be on identifying untapped talent, not saying for moral reasons you've got to take someone who went to university having had free school meals.” The paper notes that EY has removed all academic and education details from its application process while PwC has said it will stop using A-level grades as a threshold.

Robo-advice will democratise the industry
The Times reports on the threat to financial advisers from the rise of robo-advisers as the Financial Conduct Authority begins a three-day seminar on the subject. The paper notes that the use of software to recommend investments, offer advice on tax affairs, debt and financial planning, are proving popular in the US, where robo-advisers already manage funds of $6bn. Ian McKenna, of the Finance & Technology Research Centre, says: "The beauty of robo-advice is that it will democratise the industry. At the moment decent financial advice is too expensive and out of reach of most people.”

Government drops corporate liability law review
The Government has abandoned plans to create a new criminal offence for corporate wrongdoing after pledging in its manifesto to hold banks and other financial institutions to account for rate rigging, tax evasion and insurance mis-selling. Campaign group Corruption Watch said: "This decision is shockingly short-sighted. .It appears that the government is allowing its pro-business deregulation agenda to derail its anti-corruption commitments."

PENSIONS

Webb warns against Pension Isas
Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb has urged the Chancellor not to introduce "pension Isas", warning that the move could encourage savers to empty their pension pots. Pensions Isas would scrap tax relief on pension contributions and allow the over-55s to withdraw money without paying income tax. Mr Webb said: "The taxation of pension incomes provides a 'brake' on [spending]. Having to pay tax makes you think twice about withdrawing the lot in one go; if pensions are tax free, what would hold you back?" Mr Webb suggests the Government introduces a new 33% tax relief on pensions instead. However, Frank Field, Chairman of the DWP Select Committee suggested the consultation could result in "the biggest tax cutting strategy ever conceived". Ending pension tax relief altogether would save £30bn. This would save enough to lower the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 13%, he said.

Savers put off by pensions complexity
People are being put off saving into a pension because of confusion over the system, according to PwC, leaving many with much less than they think they'll need when they retire. Raj Mody, head of pensions consulting at PWC, said: "Any system that is asking people to lock up their money for many years needs to be simple to understand and trusted to encourage greater savings levels."

Labour will kill entrepreneurship
An entrepreneur whose business has created 50 jobs writes to the Telegraph to say that Labour’s tax policy will “kill entrepreneurship and economic growth.” Labour’s call for a "redistribution of wealth" by taxing business and the rich “removes the incentive to work 18-hour days to ensure the future of the business. I might as well go back to paid employment, or take my business elsewhere,” he says.

Banks face digital disruption
Consultancy group McKinsey has warned that the digital revolution in the banking sector risks profit losses from non-mortgage retail lending of up to 60% over the next decade while profits from payments processing, lending to SMEs and wealth management would be down 35%.

ECONOMY

Retailers report strong September sales
The latest survey of retailers by the CBI suggests they enjoyed a sales boom in September as rising wages and low inflation boost consumers' spending power. Respondents reported their best trade in eight years with food and clothes notching up particularly strong performances. Meanwhile, the ONS is expected to confirm that the UK grew by 0.7% in the three months to June and to upgrade past years by a significant amount. The new data is forecast to show that the UK is at least 6% larger than its pre-crisis peak, up from the present estimate of 5.2%  However, the GFK sentiment index slipped four points to +3 as consumer confidence fell from a 15-year high in August.

IMF warns of rate rise hit to emerging economies
A rise in interest rates in the US and other advanced economies risks an increase in corporate failures in emerging economies, the IMF has warned. In its Global Financial Stability Report, IMF economists warn an increase in rates and debt servicing costs posed a “a key risk for the emerging market corporate sector” with the shock quickly spilling over into bank lending and bond markets.

Animals must pay taxes to earn entitlements
Princess Michael of Kent has angered animal campaign groups by stating that animals don’t have rights because they don’t pay taxes. Speaking at the Henley Literary Festival, she said: "Today we're always hearing about animal rights. Well, I'm a great animal lover and involved in a lot of conservation, but animals don't have rights. They don't have bank accounts, they don't vote. You only have rights if you pay your taxes. You earn your rights." Peta director Elisa Allen responded: "Her daft assessment would mean that children and certain classes of human beings are also are not entitled to rights."
