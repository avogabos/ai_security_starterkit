Dear Rachel,

 

We have reviewed the documents which looks ok but would need a clearer copy
of the passport. 

 

Kind regards,

Hi,

 

Our client would like to form a new BVI company, but he wants to know first
if the attached documentation is acceptable so that the company is processed
without any delay.

 

Once you approve the documents I shall email you the company name our client
wants to register along with other details.

 

Look forward to hear from you.

 

Rachel
