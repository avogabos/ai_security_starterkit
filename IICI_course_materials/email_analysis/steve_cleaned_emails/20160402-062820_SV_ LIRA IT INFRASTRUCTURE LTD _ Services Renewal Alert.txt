Steve,

 

I do not really need the directors privacy service any longer but would like
to pay for the other services mentioned below. When entering checking My
Account, I do not, however, have the option to pay for those. Please advise.
Can you please also assist in order to arrange a bank account in the UK for
the company?

 

Kind regards,

Thomas
