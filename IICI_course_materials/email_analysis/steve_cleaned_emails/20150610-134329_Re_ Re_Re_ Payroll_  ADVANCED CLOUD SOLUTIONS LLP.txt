?Hi


This must have been a misunderstanding as I was assuming we were getting a Payroll service, not just the use of your software.


We cannot run the payroll ourselves so do you offer a more comprehensive service where we would tell you the amounts paid to each person, you would create the payslips, do the filing etc. All we would have to do is pay the amounts due to HMRC.


If you do not have this service then tell me so I can find another company to do this.


In terms of the current situation I will contact HMRC to tell them what has happened and how we can rectify it.


Regards

Chris

Dear Customer,

Thank you for your email.

Please note that we provided you with the payroll software to prepare the payslips of your employee. However, you were facing problem using our software and we kept on updating you about how you can use our system effectively.

Further, if you wish, we can generate the payslips of your employee(s) on your behalf. But, as you may know that you need to report and e-file the payslips as soon as you pay your employee, your payslips of Feb'15 and Mar'15 are relating to previous tax year of 2014/15 and you need to contact HMRC and need to request them to allow online e-filing of the payslips as the last date for e-filing for tax year 2014/15 was 19th Apr'15.

Should you require any further assistance, feel free to write us.

Regards,

Customer Support,
Accounts Centre
