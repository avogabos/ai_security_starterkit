Dear Charlotte, good morning

I would like to inform you that the bank forms are received.

I've on your note that the documents are being prepared. Please note that
apart from main set of apostilled documents, CGS apostilled and Certificate
of Incumbency notary certified and apostiled should be provided. In the
Certificate of Incumbency information regarding present director and
shareholder should be mentioned ( do not forget to add ID data- date of
birth, passport number, date of appointment). Notary should certify the
signature of the Incumbency signatory.

I should also remind you that due to company incorporation date ( 2005)
detailed bank account statements from different periods and contracts with
clients should be provided.

Regards
Ksenija
