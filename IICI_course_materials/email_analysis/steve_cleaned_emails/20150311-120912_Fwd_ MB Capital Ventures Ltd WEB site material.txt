Dear Steve,

I have forwarded the info to the graphics dept for the completion of my website since the site does not work well and I can not upload anything.

Can you pls give an update on the website, the business cards and the logo+letterhead completion and delivery of my cards?
I am trying to get the site up as soon as possible.

Can you help me pls?

Thank you once again in advance

Maria
