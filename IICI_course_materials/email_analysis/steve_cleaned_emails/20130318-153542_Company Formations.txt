Dear Steve 
 
Thank you for updating me this afternoon in respect of the Company Formations. 
 
As I understand it, and as you have confirmed, Dr HS Gupta's documentation is perfectly in order. For the purposes of clarity, all you require now is as follows:- 
 
1) Proof of Address for Karim Rajani, my cousin. Those provided are not acceptable. 
2) You also require completion of the two forms attached and sent to me. 
3) Payment for formation of the Company. 
 
All three matters should be directed to Karim. Both karim and the proposer of the Company DR HS Gupta are very keen to get the Company set up and as you stated, the Bank Accounts should be set up within two weeks. 
 
Best Wishes, and Thank you for your assistance,
