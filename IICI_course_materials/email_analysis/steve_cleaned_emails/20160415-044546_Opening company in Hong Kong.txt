Hi Steve,

I need some advices regarding opening a company in Hong Kong.

I don't have any company before and I'm planning to open a company in Hong
Kong. The main reason why i want to open a company in Hong Kong is to
be dealing with a forwarding company in Hong Kong for stock forwarding but
i will be dealing with my freight forwarder via emails and calls and i
won't be in Hong Kong. And also i need a company bank account in Hong Kong.

What do i need to do?

Thanks & Regards,
Wee Weng
