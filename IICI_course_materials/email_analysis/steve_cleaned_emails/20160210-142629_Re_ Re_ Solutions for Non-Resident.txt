Hello Steve,

Good morning. Thanks for your email  ...

What about this page in your site, which says you have ready-made
companies with bank account and VAT?

http://www.formationshouse.com/company_with_bank_account_vat.htm

Won't a non UK resident be able to purchase any of these ready-made
companies with bank account and VAT?

Please advise. Thanks again, and have a great day!  :)


Kind Regards,

James Co
