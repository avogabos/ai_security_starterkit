TAX

 

Leak reveals elite's tax havens

A huge leak of confidential documents has revealed how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth. Eleven million documents were leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, regarded as one of the world's most secretive companies. The documents appear to show that the firm has helped clients launder money, dodge sanctions and evade tax, although Mossack Fonseca says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and has never been charged with criminal wrong-doing. The firm’s services include incorporating companies in offshore jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands, and administering offshore firms for a yearly fee. According to the Guardian, Mossack Fonseca is the world’s fourth biggest provider of offshore services and has acted for more than 300,000 companies, with more than half of the companies registered in British-administered tax havens, as well as in the UK itself. The leaked data contains secret offshore companies linked to the families and associates of Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak, Libya's former leader Muammar Gaddafi and Syria's president Bashar al-Assad. It also reveals a suspected billion-dollar money laundering ring that was run by a Russian bank and involved close associates of President Putin. The documents were passed to German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, which then shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Dividend tax rise hits business owners

Business owners could lose thousands of pounds in income next year following changes to the way dividend payments are taxed. Business owners have typically favoured income drawn from dividends because a 10% tax credit is currently applied and they do not have to pay NICs. However, from this week the 10% tax credit will be abolished and all payments above £5,000 will be subject to a new basic rate of 7.5%, in addition to the £11,000 personal allowance. Higher rate taxpayers will pay tax of 32.5% above earnings of £31,786, compared to 25% previously. And those above the additional rate threshold of £150,000 are facing a rise from 31.6% to 38.1%. The changes mean an individual who pays themselves a basic salary of £11,000 and receives dividend payments of £100,000 will see their total tax bill rise from around £22,600 to £26,500. The Government hopes the new tax structure will reduce the incentives for tax motivated incorporations.

Pickles wants granny flat tax scrapped

Former communities secretary Sir Eric Pickles has urged George Osborne to drop plans to tax “granny flats”. Sir Eric, who axed council tax on granny flats in 2014 to encourage more to be built, said he would write to the Chancellor to ask him to drop the 3% stamp duty charge on granny annexes, which came into force last week. The news came as one of the leading campaign groups for the elderly warned the charge was "morally wrong and economically illiterate" and would force grandparents to move away from their families and into care homes.

IHT bill set to hit £4bn

Daniel Martin in the Mail says rising house prices will see the Government collect £4bn in inheritance tax this year, adding that the middle classes will be the hardest hit. IHT receipts for the 12 months to February, published by the Office for National Statistics, show that £4.6bn is expected to be paid compared to £3.8bn for the same period in 2014/15. Meanwhile, in light of claims that Ronnie Corbett sold his family home in 2003 in order to spare his daughters a large IHT bill, the Guardian’s Zoe Williams argues that the rise in IHT receipts is “entirely explicable by a house price bubble and does not in any way represent a ‘raid’, on the middle classes.”

HMRC to provide migrant NI figures

HMRC has confirmed it will provide figures on how many NI numbers are actively being used by people from the European Economic Area ahead of the EU referendum. MPs have pushed for the release of the figures amid suggestions the number of NI numbers issued to EU migrants has been much higher than the official immigration figures.

Stamp duty contributes to slowdown

Analysis by Knight Frank has found the overhaul of stamp duty has contributed to a slowdown of property prices in areas such as Knightsbridge and Hyde Park. It found the average house price in prime central London rose by only 0.8% in the year to March. In Knightsbridge, where the average house price is £3m, the rate of growth has fallen by 6.8% over the past year. In South Kensington, it fell by 4.9% and in Hyde Park by 3.5%.

Tax U-turn could cost Scottish Labour

Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has accused Nicola Sturgeon of "lining up beside the Scottish Tories" by opposing tax rises for top earners. Meanwhile, an editorial in the Daily Record suggests that the Scottish Labour Party has damaged its chances in the forthcoming Holyrood elections by performing a “U-turn” on taxation.

Supermarkets hit by fizzy drinks tax

New research has found that Waitrose will be the supermarket hit hardest by the sugar tax as the largest proportion of its own-brand drinks will face the charges. Researchers said 62.7% of Waitrose’s own-label drinks offered on its website would be taxed, with nearly half coming under the higher 24p-per-litre band. Of the major supermarkets, Morrisons would see the smallest proportion of products hit, at 44%.

INDUSTRY

 

Brexit causing “fog of uncertainty” among financial chiefs

Hiring and investment expectations among CFOs have fallen to a three-year low, as companies are becoming nervous of the EU referendum, according to a report from Deloitte. The poll found support for staying in the EU had risen to 75% of CFOs, up from 62% in the final quarter of 2015. A total of 8% of CFOs said UK business would benefit from leaving the EU and 17% were uncertain of their position or preferred not to say. It comes after a study commissioned by the CBI and compiled by PwC warned that leaving the EU could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household £3,700 worse off.

AIM continues to struggle

A report by UHY Hacker Young shows the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) has continued to struggle in the past year, with more companies delisting and fewer IPOs. A total of 105 companies quit the market in the past year - a rise of 18%, while just 35 companies floated. Financial stress and insolvency was the biggest reason for companies exiting the market, responsible for a total of 27 delistings. The research also highlighted the number of Chinese AIM-listed companies that delisted due to ongoing uncertainty over corporate governance.

UK companies ‘woefully unprepared’ for audit rotation rules

Only around a fifth of CFOs, tax directors and audit committee chairs from across the FTSE 350 are ready for incoming rules on audit rotation, EY research has found.

Transport mergers set to break £52bn barrier

Research by KPMG indicates transport companies are set for another rise in mergers and acquisitions this year, with the total value of such deals expected to reach £52bn.

SMEs

 

Lloyds helps SMEs to export

Lloyds Banking Group has announced a new initiative to help SMEs start exporting, in an effort to reverse the UK’s growing trade deficit. The bank has pledged to help 5,000 SMEs export goods for the first time during 2016, and a total of 25,000 by the end of the decade, along with a £1bn boost to SME lending. The drive is part of the Government’s plan to kick-start exports from 100,000 businesses by 2020. Lord Price, the minister for trade and investment, said: "This government has committed to having 100,000 more UK companies exporting by 2020, and this pledge by Lloyds is a welcome contribution towards this target.”

Appointments

KPMG has announced the appointment of Martin Findlay as a new office senior partner in Aberdeen. Duncan MacAskill, an audit partner who became office senior partner in 2007 and has spent 35 years with KPMG, will retire in June.

PROPERTY

 

Investors warn of Brexit impact for property markets

A KPMG poll of 25 global real estate investors shows that two thirds believe a Brexit would result in less inward investment into UK property and property companies. The investors, all of which have assets under management of over $400bn, say a period of uncertainty following a Brexit would damage property markets more than remaining in the EU.

ECONOMY

 

ONS to figure out sharing economy

The Office for National Statistics is to publish a feasibility study on how it could measure the sharing economy. The report, due out tomorrow, is part of a drive to update its surveys to better measure new ways people consume and trade goods and services. In his review of official statistics published last month, the former Bank of England deputy governor, Sir Charlie Bean, estimated that if the digital economy was fully captured it could add 0.75 percentage points to Britain's growth rate.

Super-rich caught out by social media

Heirs of the super-wealthy are unwittingly exposing their families to scrutiny from fraud investigators and criminals by flaunting their lavish lifestyles on social media. Sites such as Instagram have increasingly become the place for affluent youngsters to boast of their family wealth, with leading cybersecurity firms saying they now use social media posts as evidence in around 75% of all litigation cases. In one debt recovery case cited by the Telegraph, a man claimed to have no items of significant value only for one of his children to give the game away by posing on the family’s £12m super-yacht in the Bahamas.
