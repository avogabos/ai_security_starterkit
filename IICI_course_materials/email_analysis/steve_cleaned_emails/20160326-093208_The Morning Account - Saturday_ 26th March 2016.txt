TAX

 

All hands on deck to complete deals ahead of stamp duty rise

Landlords, estate agents and solicitors are scrambling to complete property deals before an increase in stamp duty on buy-to-let and second homes comes in. Solicitors are working the Easter weekend to help landlords and second home buyers, with some clients reportedly paying lawyers £2,000 for their conveyancing work in an attempt to complete deals before April 1. Richard Tuck, director of Turtle Homes, said some conveyancing solicitors had increased their fees in return for getting deals done on time. The changes will push the tax bill on a £200,000 home from £1,500 to £7,500, but despite the rise, experts say buy-to-let will remain attractive to investors.

Retailers in airports still pocketing customers’ VAT savings

A survey of five airports by the Mail found that retailers in airport terminals are still not passing on VAT savings to customers who are flying to destinations outside the EU. The paper found that WHSmith and Dixons Travel continued to ask for travel documents and charge the same prices, while Boots has stopped asking to see boarding passes but has not lowered prices and is not passing on discounts. A spokesman for HMRC told the Mail: “The review into airside VAT-free shopping is on-going.”

Soft drink tax challenge

Drinks maker AG Barr CEO Roger White has expressed his disappointment at news of a sugar tax, pointing out that soft drinks were the "only food and drink category to have made any real progress in reducing sugar intake in recent years, down 13.6% since 2012". Soft drinks makers are now considering taking legal action against the Government on competition grounds. The Express notes that similar taxes in Scandinavia have been successfully challenged.

Retailers urged to pass on tampon tax cut

Following Government plans to legislate to exempt sanitary products from VAT, retailers and manufacturers are coming under pressure to reduce the prices of feminine hygiene products amid fears prices on the high street will not reflect the change. Labour MP Paula Sherriff has written to major retailers and suppliers urging them to cut prices and not “try to pocket a £17m windfall."

PENSIONS

 

Pension freedoms 12 months on

The Telegraph’s Katie Morley looks at who took advantage of pensions freedoms one year on and what they did with their money. The latest data from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that 383,571 pensions were accessed in the UK in the first six months after 6 April, with one in five using money to pay off debts. The most popular method of accessing cash is a facility called uncrystallised funds pension lump sum (UFPLS), chosen by 34% of retirees overall, followed by flexi-access drawdown, chosen by 30%. Annuities were chosen by just 13% of savers. A similar assessment is undertaken by the Guardian’s Patrick Collinson, who points out that property was the most popular destination for people’s savings, but considering the 7.33m people in the 55-64 age bracket, most did nothing at all.

A guide to achieving the perfect Isa

The Daily Telegraph provides a guide to achieving the perfect Isa, pulling together 87 tips to help savers make their Isas more efficient - and more profitable. The paper notes that in April next year there will be six types of Isa: stocks and shares, cash, junior, help to buy, peer-to-peer and lifetime. The annual allowance will also become even more generous, rising from £15,240 to £20,000.

SMEs paying for pensions advice unnecessarily  

Research from the Pensions Regulator and payroll firm Paycircle suggests SMEs could pay out £317m for advice on setting up work-based pensions over the next three years. However, many of those eligible for free advice have been paying out up to £1,000 in fees, the study found.

Brexit campaign supported by 250 business leaders

Former HSBC CEO Michael Geoghegan is among 250 business leaders to back the Vote Leave campaign to take Britain out of the EU. Signatories including Roger Bootle, managing director of Capital Economics, John Caudwell, founder of Phones 4U, and Joe Foster, co-founder of Reebok, will join a new business council chaired by former British Chambers of Commerce director John Longworth. Mr Geoghegan stated that the “UK's businesses and in particular its financial services sector would thrive outside the EU if the country votes to leave.” Mr Longworth added: “Many firms struggle with relentless interference from the EU and rules that are stacked in the favour of a select number of businesses. If we Vote Leave, liberated from the shackles of EU membership, jobs will be safer, Britain will be able to spend our money on our priorities and we can look forward to faster growth and greater prosperity in the future.” The pro-EU Britain Stronger in Europe group derided the Vote Leave list, pointing out that it did not include a single FTSE 100 chief executive or chairman.

Britain risks addiction to low interest rates

Writing in the Telegraph, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and a former member of the MPC, suggests continued low interest rates will leave Britain addicted and that the BoE is not taking into account the potential problems a prolonged period of very low rates may be creating for the economy. Key issues resulting from this situation include: the normalisation of low rates, increased house prices, higher consumer debt and poor returns for savers. Mr Sentance concludes by stating that the role of an independent central bank is “to take a long-term view and to look beyond the short-term fluctuations and uncertainties. That means taking account of the negative consequences of a prolonged period of exceptionally low savings returns and borrowing costs and not continually postponing the process of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.”
