Dear Steve,

I have been notified that we need to file for PSC pls see attached, when we file for annual returns. 

Are you aware if this?

I know MB Capital isn't due till September and December respectively, but pls drop me a note to tell me if you can provide me with this service and file it for me too.

Many thanks in advance. 

Best regards

Maria
