Dear Charlotte,

 

We are losing time with Rietumu. Mr Rafalsons needed the certified scan copy of my ID to start processing the account, and up to now he did get it neither the original of it, and all process in on hold since a week.

 

Thank you for your assistance,

 

Kind regards

Raphael

Dear Mr. Dayan,

I did not receive the scan of certified copy. Maybe, she sent it directly to me by post?
