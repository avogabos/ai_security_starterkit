Hi Shawn,

 

This is fine. Proceed with the order, but please ensure the customer is
aware of the necessity to become appropriately authorised with the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA) for any financial leasing operations.  More
information can be found at https://www.fca.org.uk.

 

Thanks,

Elliot

Hi Elliot,

 

Hope you are doing.

 

We have RM Company Order. ID DOCUMNETS are attached for your reference. The
documents have been verified.




However the provided SIC Code 64910 (Financial Leasing) is high risk.

So could you please check and advise on this matter.

 

Looking forward to hear from you.

 

Regards,
