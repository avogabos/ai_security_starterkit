Hi,

 

Pls fill the form yourself. You must TYPE all the details i.e name contact
number email address and address of director and todays date(on 1st page)
and company details on 2nd page. 

 

The client will only have to SIGN the form and put the date. This form is
not acceptable.

 

Also, we will need the NOTARIZED set of company directors along with the
original form & it will be posted to New Haven. 

 

Ask ur customer to scan and email you the new signed form (with all the
details TYPED not hand written) and provide you the tracking number,.

 

Thanks

I am not sure as who is going to process this BVI registration. I was told
first, Rizwan will process, then told that Tahir will process and I have
been told SARAH will process BVI.

 

 

So please, the relevant person process this order.

 

 

Customer will be sending the documents by post soon.
