Dear Steve,
I don't sell to UK customers!! 
I might want to appoint a tax representative, accountant or an agent to deal with HMRC on your behalf about your VAT affairs. 
That is why I pay 600gbp for you to service VAT and return. Why need a address in UK? Why can't use invoice I gave to you? I don't sell to UK customers.
 
Tks,
 
Penny

Dear Sir,
 
I told you before,we export of goods from the United Kingdom!! I have no clients in UK! I only have supplier!
Do you understand? I want to set up a company only for export!
I can give you the purchase order or invoice that buyer is my company name:HYP ENGINEERING
Or give you the purchase order or invoice from my Chinese customers. Is that okey?
 
We need provide warehouse address in UK? Need rent contract?

Dear Customer,

Thank you for your email.

This is to inform you that the evidence of trade could be receipt/purchase order sent to you from your clients in UK which proves your intention to trade in UK. 

Alternatively, in order to avoid that you may provide us with any address in UK as your business address. It could be a warehouse address.

We look forward to hearing from you and to assist you soon.

If you need any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us anytime between 9AM GMT to 9PM GMT by telephone (Sales: 02070162727/02072552557 Support: 02070162728), live chat (www.formationshouse.com) or email (support@formationshouse.com).
