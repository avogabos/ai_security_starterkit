Re: Which bank
Dear Steve
Thanks very much. Tomorrow morning i will execute the
payment as today has been Bank holiday here in Italy and will send you a copy
of the Bank receipt as requested.
Yes, the code will be on the document, but i will also need
the pass phrase to verify it. Will you provide it to me?
Thanks a lot

Dear Steve,
which bank should i send the money to for the order of the
gambian gbc2? Santander or Barclays? I got instruction for both.
Also, Zohra's offshore bank asked if you will provide a code
to verify the authenticity of the gambian documents on the gambian on line
registry, not just on your website:
http://verify.icommerceregistry.com/
Thanks a lot
