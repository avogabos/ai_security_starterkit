Dear Steve,

 

Please find enclosed an electricity invoice within the last 3 months.

 

Is everything ok for you ? Can I proceed with the payment ? 

 

Regarding the payment do you allow me to ask someone else (a customer based
in Europe) to do the payment ? Or do you want me to do it personally (a bit
more complicated for me as I don't have a credit card).

 

Waiting for your reply.

 

Regards

Dear Fogan,

 

Thank you for the document, unfortunately one small problem with the
document that it is more than 3 months old. IF you can arrange the same
document dated within last 3 months it will resolve all the issues and
company will be available within 48 hours.

 

Waiting for your reply.

 

Regards

 

Steve
