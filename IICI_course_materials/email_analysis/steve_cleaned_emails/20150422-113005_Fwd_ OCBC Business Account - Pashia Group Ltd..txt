Hello Steve,

We have been told by Jake from OCBC that the incumbency certificate still contains the wrong incorporation date.  Could you please double check with him on that?  JakeChow@ocbc.com and make sure he receives a correct soft and hard copy of the document?  I don't understand how this is so difficult.  

Than you very much
