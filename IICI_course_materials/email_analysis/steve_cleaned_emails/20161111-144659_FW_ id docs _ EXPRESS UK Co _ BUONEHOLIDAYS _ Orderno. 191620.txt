Hi Elliot,

 

This is another company formation order. And the Driector is also from
India. The docs seem alright to me. I have prepared the CCD form. Could you
please have a look at it and let me know if all is good so that I may
process the company formation order.

 

BUONEHOLIDAYS : Orderno. 191620

 

Awaiting your reply in this regard.

 

Thanks,

 

Michael
