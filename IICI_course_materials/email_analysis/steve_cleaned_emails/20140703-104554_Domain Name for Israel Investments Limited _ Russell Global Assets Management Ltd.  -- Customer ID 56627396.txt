Dear Steve,

I have changed the name of Russell Global Assets Management Ltd. to Israel
Investments Limited. A domain for Russell Global Assets Management had been
registered as russellglobalassetsmanagement.com.

As the name of the company has been changed, the name of the domain should
also change. Please change it to israelinvestments.com and delete the
registration for russellglobalassetsmanagement.com.

Thank you very much.

Yours sincerely,

Jessica Tauch
