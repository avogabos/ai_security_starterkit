Subject: SMART CONSULTING LTD : Identity documents and payment receipt

Dear Steve,

Thank you for your email. I have attached scans of my passport and a recent credit card statement.

I have also paid the sum of £265 by BACS Faster Payments to your Santander account and I attach a screen shot of the successful payment.

Please note that my assistant had incorrectly transcribed my date of birth in your system. My correct date of birth is 5th March 1961. Do you have the online filing PIN from Companies House so that I can update the company's registered office and my appointment details?

There was a second company of yours that I was considering purchasing but when I tried to select it just now, the system said that it wasn't available. Please could you verify the status of Ideal Digital Ltd? Many thanks.

Regards,

Alison Crawford
