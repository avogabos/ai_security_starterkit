Fund your account

Your minimum opening deposit is $500.00 - please fund within the next 30 days.

Your wiring instructions are HERE <https://files.europacbank.com/docs/EPB_MT103.pdf> .

Wire instructions can be tricky, so for your first attempts I highly recommend that you send me your blank wire transfer form, an online screenshot, or the fields required. I would be happy to assist you or your sending bank fill out your wire form. At the minimum, I would be happy to verify your bank's wire form before your first wire is executed.

Please notify me if you have any issues completing your bank's wire form.

 

Lastly, please also read these important Wire Transfer Guidelines <https://europacbank.com/support/wire-transfer-best-practices/> .


Order a Debit Card

	


After funding your account, you can order a debit card by clicking the orange Request Card <http://secure.europacbank.com/index.php?section=accounts&item=request_card>  button in your Online Banking home page.

 

Please contact me if:

*	You have any questions regarding the name imprinting or the shipping of the debit card.
*	Cards are to be printed with any names other than what is on your account.
*	You are ordering more than one card.
*	You are ordering Payroll Cards (ask me for more details).
