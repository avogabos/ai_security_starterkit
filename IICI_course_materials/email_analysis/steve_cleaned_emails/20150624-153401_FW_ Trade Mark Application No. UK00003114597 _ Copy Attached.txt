Dear Sir/Madam,

Your payment has been cleared and a certified copy of your trade mark
application is attached.

What happens next?

We will usually issue your examination report in about 20 working days. We
will tell you if your trade mark has been accepted or if we have objections
to its acceptance.

We recommend that you check your in-box and any spam filter or junk folder
to ensure you reply to any objections in your examination report within the
allowed time limits.

Right Start customers - If you decide to proceed with your application, you
must pay the balance of fees within 14 days of the date of the examination
report.

Please quote your trade mark application number in all communications with
us. If you have a payment query, please also include your payment reference
number as shown above.

Yours faithfully,
