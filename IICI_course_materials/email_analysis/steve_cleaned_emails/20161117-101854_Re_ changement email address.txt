thanks a lot, Steve, for the infos.

First: has Rinascita LTD anything to pay concerning taxes ? The company
never operated and I wanted to cancel it. If I understood, it doesn' t
exist anymore, is it ?

Second: how much does Frozen Yogurt have to pay for its annual return ?

Kindest regards

changement email address
Dear Mr. Steve,
since now, I would like to change my email address from
iadex@libero to
frozenyogurtltd@gmail.com
(the one I'm emailing now).
Just one information: I made a payment of 275,00 euro
for Company Protection Service for Frozen Yogurt ltd (order n. 191462 of
last 25.10.2016).
Why didn' t you email me back any invoice and is service still not
activate ? Can you check the situation ?
Kindest regards
Massimiliano Iadecicco
