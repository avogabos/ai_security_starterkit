Hi Marc, 

 

6232188106156 UTR

 

The accounts overdue date is 28 Feb 2017 you will incur fines if you do not file after this date. 

 

The period is for 1st June 2015 to 31st May 2016

 

You can purchase our Accounting and VAT filing services. You are still using our address which is a paid for service. Please ensure that you pay for this ASAP. 

 

My college Steve can help you with setting up all of this. I have copied him in this email. He is your assigned Account Manager since Felix has left the company. 

 

We look forward to hearing from you. 

 

Kind regards

Nadya
