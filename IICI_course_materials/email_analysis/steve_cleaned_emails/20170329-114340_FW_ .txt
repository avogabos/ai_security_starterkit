  Hi Formations House official,

 

  How are you?

 

  I am emailing you to inquire about   UK company formation for internationals.

  

  I am not a UK resident and would like to register a UK company through your service.

  

  Could you please tell me what documents I need to provide for the procedure?

 

  Best regards,
 

  Li
