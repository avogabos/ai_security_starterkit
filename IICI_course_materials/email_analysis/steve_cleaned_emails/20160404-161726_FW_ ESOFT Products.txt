Hi Tahir,

 

I hope my email finds you well.

 

I think some of ESOFT LTD products have been expired, can you please send
the invoice to renew the following:

Registered address 1 year £100- Online company administrator 1 year £25-
Annual Return Fee £15.

Is there anything else that I have to renew?

 

Thank you

 

Best Regards, 

Rana Risheh
