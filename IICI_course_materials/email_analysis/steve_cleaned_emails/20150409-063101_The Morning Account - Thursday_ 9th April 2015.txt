Labour’s non-dom change proves divisive
Doubts have been raised over the costing of Labour’s non-dom rule changes with some saying the policy would put Britain’s reputation at risk. Both Simon Walker of the IoD and Stuart Adam of the IFS said it was unclear what additional revenue would be raised from the move. Emma Chamberlain, a tax barrister and HMRC adviser, warned that the move could lead to 30,000 non-doms leaving Britain and deter up to 40,000 wealthy foreigners from coming to this country, while James Hender at Saffery Champness said clients were concerned about the proposal and were looking to plan ahead. However, Baker Tilly senior tax partner George Bull believes the policy would not lead to an exodus of well-off non-residents, noting that just a minority of non-doms will be affected, primarily those not working in the UK. George Osborne accused Labour of “tinkering round the edges” with its pledge to abolish non-dom tax status and pointed out that the Conservatives “will raise £5bn a year in the next parliament by continuing to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion, including abuses of the non-dom rules.” The Times says Mr Osborne is now considering removing the ability of children to inherit their parents’ non-dom status to counter Labour’s pledge. Meanwhile, Labour accused the Tories of editing an interview from January in which Ed Balls said abolishing the whole status would probably end up costing Britain money. Elsewhere, Danny Alexander has said the Lib Dems wanted to tackle abuses of the non-dom status in the next parliament to raise an extra £130m.

Australia could face retaliatory rules on tax
Australian senators have accused Google, Apple and Microsoft of setting up complex corporate structures designed to minimise their corporate tax bills in Australia. The parliamentary hearing saw Google Australia’s managing director Maile Carnegie argue that imposing similar anti-avoidance rules to the UK’s diverted profits tax could have adverse consequences for Australian companies, such as Rio Tinto, operating in overseas jurisdictions. Ms Carnegie said international co-operation was the best way to tackle the issue.

Most voters would pay more tax for NHS
A poll by ComRes has found that 53% of voters would be prepared to pay 1% more income tax if it was reserved for NHS spending. Overall, roughly one third of adults would be unwilling to pay more. The research found Labour and Liberal Democrat voters were more likely to be willing to pay extra while Conservative and UKIP supporters were less willing.

Asset managers pose growing threat, warns IMF
The IMF is calling for a regulatory crackdown on asset managers, including the introduction of stress tests akin to those covering the banking system. In its Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said that as banks have pulled back from many market making activities this has possibly resulted result in lower market liquidity. Structural changes in the financial system, as well as of the prolonged period of low interest rates in the world’s major economies, have led funds to load up on assets of late.

HMRC leads the way in diversity
Virginia Matthews explores HMRC’s Embrace scheme which has been seeking to improve representation of BAME staff among junior managers in HMRC's personal tax group. Sandra Kerr, national director of the business-led Race for Opportunity, said HMRC had shown "an intelligent approach" to future leader diversity. "This is a great example of a public sector organisation which has gathered critical data, assessed the best point at which to intervene and taken targeted action which has now been extended to the rest of the organisation," she says. “Other public sector employers need to follow suit."

Insurers cautious over pensions

Personal debt set to reach £2.5trn by 2020
Levels of personal debt are expected to rise by 62% by 2020, reaching £47,195 of debt per adult, of which £34,124 would be mortgage borrowing, according to a new study. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates adults currently owe an average of £29,126. The rise, predicted by The Money Charity would put total UK personal debt at £2.5trn by the end of the decade. A separate study by the Debt Advisory Centre warned that 12% of Britons are turning to credit just to buy groceries and other basics. Research published earlier this month by PwC issued a similar warning and showed many Britons routinely misunderstand the true cost of debt.
