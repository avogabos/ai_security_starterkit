Dear Steve,
sorry for my late reply caused by our holidays ...
Anyway, let us clearify the following asthere is a misunderstanding inthe transfers and values:
- we have paid in the first step the sum of USD 780 whereas it should be GBP 780
- we calculated out that USD 780 corresponds to GBP 510 whereas you informed ust that you only received GBP 467
- unforunately we have effected another transfer of the remaining payment (according to our records) in the value of GBP 270 (being the balance of 780 GBP - 510 GBP) on July 16th and we have also included the reference number on the P/I - ZVLE-01-0613
- according to your information we still owe you the balance amount of GBP 43 which we will effect from the same account as the last payment of GBP 270 by tomorrow itself
Pls, check and confirm the receipt of the last payment of GBP 270 at earliest.
As far as the delivery address is concerned we would like to use the following delivery address:
Celorod, s.r.o.
maria Sarkozyova
Haydnova 21
81102 Bratislava
SLOVAKIA
Tel:+421905611487
Thanking you and awaitimg your reply anxiously,
