Hello Steve,

Thanks for these informations.

I am the director of the company, and am not resident in the United Kingdom
(I reside in France).

I would need some additional information on opening an account in the Saint
Vincent Islands:

- What is the name of the bank?
- will it be a sterling account?
- will the account number be an IBAN account starting with GB ....?
- What are the opening bank charges? Current charges?

thank you,
Best regards,

Re: Our Meting Today (Wednesday, 21 December 2016 at 11-AM)
Dear Steve,
I met at 1 pm your colleague Ms. Nadya Crowford.
I created my company LPG INTERNATIONAL LONDON LIMITED
(Company number 10345882) with Formations House. I now need to open a bank
account for the company. I enclose a letter of reference from HSBC Montreal.
Can you help me open an account in London at HSBC (or another bank, RBS, ...)?
Moreover, I will accompany French entrepreneurs in London
and I wanted to discuss with you how to establish a partnership for the
creation of their company?
A first customer, Salesbuzzter, will contact you.
thank you,
