Hi, 

 

I spoke to you yesterday about setting up a company and also a bank account
for this  

company. 

 

You mentioned , It can be with barclays or a cyprus based bank. 

 

I attach a few docs . These are the only items i have. 

 

How confident would you be that this can be done with these docs. 

 

There are no other docs available. 

 

Regards 

Irfan
