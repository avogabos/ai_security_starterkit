Hi Steve,

We are interested in incorporating a new business entity in Spain using the
two IBC's we currently have you (Henry Weber and Dalton Pascal).

We'd also be interested in setting up a business bank account in Spain and
if you provide a merchant account.

Please let us know if this something you can assist us with.

Regards
