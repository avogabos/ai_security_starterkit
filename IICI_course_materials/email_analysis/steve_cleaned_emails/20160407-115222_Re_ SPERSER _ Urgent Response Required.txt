Hi Steve,

Thank you for your email.  When ordering this company formation, I
completed the new user form whereas I realised I already have an account
with you and should have used that.  My customer ID for the other account
is 25625837

Can you very my ID from that account?  As I believe you only ever need to
this for your customers once.

Thanks,
Abdul Noor Rashid
