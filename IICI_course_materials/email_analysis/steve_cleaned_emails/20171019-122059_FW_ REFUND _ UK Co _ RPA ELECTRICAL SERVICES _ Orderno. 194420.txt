From: <charlotte@formationshouse.com>
To: "'Steve Smith \(Formations House\)'" <steve@formationshouse.com>
CC: "'Oliver'" <oliver@formationshouse.com>

The refund is done however

 

1.	The customer should have been advised its 8 hours (working hours) from receiving payment and due diligence docuemnts (its statted clearly in the terms and conditions)
2.	The VAT is obligatory, and its on our site as a banner warning during the time while we implemented the vat in checkout.
3.	Companies House would not be aware of anything to do with this as no forms for incorporation were submitted and as an agent we are within our terms and conditions.

 

Our decision to refund is due to the fact it appears difficult for you to send the due diligence documents within the time required, and as our advisor did not make it clear in the second call that the 8 hr window is 8 working hours from receiving the due diligence we agree to refund.

 

The service allows you to form a company in 8 working hours (Working hours are: 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday). Please understand this is not a guaranteed response time as a number of factors outside our control can delay the formation. If we are unable to incorporate within 8 working hours you will not be charged the £25 express fee

This is stated on the website, and as an upgrade to the Business pack it still stands by the compliance rule of not completing any incorporation without the due diligence documents,

 

 

 

 

In future, please ensure you really answer what the issues were and be clear, 

I have no issue refunding if no work was carried out but in this instance we have admitted a wrong doing when we are not wrong and we must never do that

Thank you for calling me this afternoon.   Your response is appreciated.

 

However as I pointed out to the gentleman who called:

 

a)  Your website advises that you are able to complete the whole process in eight hours.  How is this possible if after eight hours you request further documentation to complete Due Diligence requirements.  No mention is made of this at the outset.  It was imperative that this new company be formed as quickly as possible.  If we had been made aware of this requirement at the start of the process we would have been aware that we would not be able to do this within eight hours as one of the Directors works on a building site!!

b)  Your payment request made no mention of an additional amount for VAT.  Your representative who called this afternoon acknowledged that no mention is made of a further VAT amount to be charged on your website and also advised that your technicians are currently working on the website to correct this fault.  I am, of course, aware that above a certain annual turnover you are obliged to charge VAT.  However, I had assumed that this was included in the fee you were charging.

 

I logged on to your website on Thursday, 12th October 2017.  I paid £95.00 for the Instant Trading Solution UK and a further £25 for the Express Formation.

 

Please would you refund the £120.00 to my Barclaycard number 4929 1085 1177 8004, Expiry date 08/19.  Please would you also confirm to me by email that this has been done without delay.

 

I will, of course, be forwarding a copy of this email chain to Companies House for their reference.

 

I look forward to hearing back from you by return.

Your initial start up information did not mention either that you would be charging VAT as an "add on".  Furthermore I was under the impression that the company could be formed without complication in eight hours.

 

As you have not been able on this occasion to provide the service promised, please refund the amount I have already paid.

 

Thank you.
