Dear
Jean-Jacques Gomez
Please note that even if there is a single business transaction in a year, company is considered as ‘trading company’ for that period and company is required to go through that exact process of annual filings like a trading company. Therefore it is not possible to file active accounts and dormant accounts both for specific time period in a year. Either you file dormant accounts if there is ‘0’ trading or you file active accounts if there is even 1 transaction.
Since annual accounts are OVERDUE, so first company needs to file the accounts and the company can submit Company Dissolution Application.
Regarding penalties, letters are from HMRC and Companies House. HMRC is asking to pay due amount and Companies House is asking to submit Annual Accounts. Once annual accounts are submitted then Companies House will contact you for late filing penalty.
With the addition of Company Dissolution service you total expenses will be as following:
-
Extreme Accounting : GBP 500
-
Company Dissolution : GBP 75
Please note that if you want to close the company then file Company Dissolution application before May 2016. Because in May 2016 company’s Annual Return will be due.
Please advice how you wish to proceed.
Regards
Steve

Dear Steve,
Thank you for your email.
I have to close the company and I'm almost out of money.
I need your opinion please. I'll pay you to stop the company, but I want to do less with HMRC.
For several months I did not make any sales.
Here is my question: The cheapest with HMRC and with you it may be to do the accounts until today.
Between April 1 2015 and today I have not sold and I put in my pocket money to pay fees and wages.
I have one excel sheet I joined you to show you.
I will of course pay you your job, but you can well advise me?
I understood that I pay for my almond delay (see HMRC document attached)
If it's too late and I pay almonds, it is perhaps better to stop the company with the calculation of accounts until today?
Thank you for your advice.
Jean-Jacques Gomez.
