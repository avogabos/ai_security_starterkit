	Hello again,

	 

	Thank you very much for this detailed information.

	I have actually another question, are nominee secretary and nominee
shareholder included in these packages as these seem to be mandatory
for UK ltd? 

	Our business would be offering title deeds to customers

	 

	 

	Kindest regards,

	Dear Laurens

 Thank you for your email.

 We can certainly provide you with a readymade UK company. They are
not dissolved but they are dormant companies.

 The list of ReadyMade UK Companies can be viewed at:

 http://www.formationshouse.com/search/readymade.php

 With a UK ReadyMade company you can choose Managed Company Service
Package (Bornze, Silver or Gold). The cost will be price of UK
readymade company PLUS price of managed company service package.

 Please confirm if you need a bank account opening service which is
included in the managed company service package. Because nominee
director will be the signatory for bank account and nominee director
will manage bank account on your behalf.

 Please provide details of business activity.

 Company name change will cost 25 GBP (15 working days) and 125 GBP
(same company name change). Please note company name change is subject
to availaibility.

 Manage Company Service BRONZE Package 3500 GBP is renewaable on
yearly basis at the cost of 3500 GBP per annum.

 Real director can be exposed if there is a court order to disclose
the information of beneficial owner.

 After you make the order, payment and provide due diligence
documents, company will be available within 2-3 working days and bank
account opening will take 3-4 weeks.

 Documents required for due diligence for company formation:

 Scan color copies of following documents are required for company
owner/director/s and shareholder/s.

 1. Proof of ID - Valid Passport
 2. Proof of Address - Last 3 months utility bills (water OR gas OR
electricity) or latest personal bank/credit card statement.

 If the documents are not in English then you need to have them
translated and notorized. And send original and translated copies.

 If you require further information or assistance you can contact me
at info@formationshouse.com or steve@formationshouse.com or
0044-(0)207-016-2727 Monday to Friday 12pm to 7pm GMT.
