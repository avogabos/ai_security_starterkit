First as I told you previously that I have to take approval from CP to give
you 4 bonuses, till I don't have approval from her I can't issue extra
bonus. Second bonuses are totally depends upon Manager approval so we can't
add until concern manager or top management ask us to pay. Now regarding
this year bonus if you don't get full bonus after you get all the bonus
installments then you can question us, we have to go as per the budget
provided to us.

 

My suggestion to you is that instead of emailing kindly talk to me or your
manager to ask me how much you will get this year.  So don't worry you will
get 3 this year as your manager confirmed me this year.

 

Regards

Fahad

This is to inform that on 26th Sept 2016 I received "the 1st installment" of
bonus for the period of 2015-2016 which is Rs. 28800/-.

 

I would like to remind that in June 2016, I had a chat with Mr. Fahad Waheed
and Mr. Ishaq Khan regarding my bonus and was told that this year I would be
receiving 3 bonus as per company policy, therefore it was expected that the
1st installment of bonus  would be Rs. 43200/-. , which is not the case.
Neither I have been told why I got the lesser amount.

 

Please explain why I did not get the 3 bonus as per company policy which was
confirmed by Mr. Fahad and Mr. Ishaq?

 

And second point which was discussed and confirmed by Mr. Fahad and Mr.
Ishaq that I should have received 3  bonus last year, but only 2 bonus were
received. Reason given by Mr. Fahad "because it was Mr. Qamar's
responsibility to approve bonus upgrade but he left before my due time, so
there was no one there to take the responsibility for upgrade nor to inform
t6he authorize person." It was said very casually which felt like they are
saying 'if you don't remember then we will also not tell you and since you
don't remember then we will deny your rights and now no matter how much you
ask for it we will just shrug our shoulders and walk away'.

 

In June 2016 Mr. Fahad assured me that he will try to arrange 4 bonus for me
this year to compensate last year missing bonus. I have asked him few times
and his response interprets that not a single thought has been given to my
request till date.

 

With all due respect, the treatment I am receiving in this issue is now very
embarrassing for me and I am being made to feel that I am nothing but a very
low grade employee who will never be heard, who will be denied rights at
will and will be treated like a trash.

 

I have never asked for which is not mine, I am only asking which is
promised.

 

I understand transition has its effect on company and management in many
ways and I have assured many times that I stand by company and bare the
effects but atleast I deserve that I should be heard seriously and deserve
an answer that when I can get what is rightfully mine.

 

Regards

 

Steve.
