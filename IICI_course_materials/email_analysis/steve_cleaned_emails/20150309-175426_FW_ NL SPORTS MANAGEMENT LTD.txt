Hi,

Client did not order it but this company is not in good standing and AC
Management will not prepare the docs for this company.
Are we going to prepare the apostilled good standing for this client?
Please advise so that we can ask client to make payment.

Regards,

 

Rachel

Dear Charlotte, good afternoon

I would like to contact you regarding the above mentioned company.

Client contacted the bank and he informed us that we should receive renewal
documents  ( apostilled CGS) from you.

Please precise when should we accept the document to be received?

Regards
