Dear Phil
Thank you for the documents.
Shares information for DIRECT PLUS
LTD is
Share Capital: 1000 GBP
Value Per Share: 1 GBP
Share Certificates: 1000
Shares assign to Lorraine Whiskin: 1
Unalloted shares: 999
In UK company you have share capital
as unpaid.
WHAT IS SHARE CAPITAL?
Share capital is the investment in a
company by its members (owners). The amount is contributed in exchange for the
share of ownership, a certificate being issued for each share.
When a company is established, the people who form the company decide that the
member's liability is limited to their contributed share capital. The
Memorandum of Association for a company states the following things in this
regard:
Total
     share capital of the company
The
     division of share capital into shares of fixed amount
The
     names of the people who have agreed to own shares and the number of shares
     each will own.
Those people who have agreed to take
some or all of the company shares are called "Subscribers"
WHAT IS AUTHORISED SHARE CAPITAL?
Authorised share capital is the
maximum value of shares that can be distributed to existing or potential investors.
In other words, the amount of share capital stated in the Memorandum of
Association is the company's 'authorised' share capital. The company's
authorised share capital may also be called its 'nominal' share capital.
IS THERE A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM SHARE
CAPITAL?
Minimum of 1 share is required for a
private limited company and there is no maximum share capital limit.
WHAT IS ISSUED CAPITAL?
Issued capital is the value of the shares
issued to shareholders. The amount of issued capital cannot exceed the amount
of the authorised capital.
A private limited company is not required to issue all of its share capital at
once.

Steve
