Dear Cindy,
Everything is in place to process company transfer only waiting
for payment and SIC code. We will start process as soon as we get payment of
GBP 315 and SIC Code from you and process will complete within 2 working days.
Once company is transferred, we will then submit application for
increase in shares and issue new shares. Meanwhile you can send payment for
company name change. After receiving payment it will take 8 working hours for
company name to be changed.
Regards
Steve…
