Hi Steve



I have arranged the payment of £250 to the account below, you should see this in your account this afternoon with the reference ACS LLP renew.



In terms of the accounts, what form do you need the data - we have not transacted that much last year and I have all of the information on a large spread sheet.



Can you tell me what you need and who I should give it to.



Thanks

Chris
