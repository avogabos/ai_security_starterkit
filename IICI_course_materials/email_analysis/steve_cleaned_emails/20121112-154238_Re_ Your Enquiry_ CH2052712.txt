Dear Sir,

Company: Luca Investment Limited
Company Number: 07576692

Thank you for your email, concerning the above company.

The are two procedures for restoring a company to the register, which are:


 *   An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
 *   Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.
 If the company intends to apply for Administrative Restoration, Companies House will require the following documents and filing fees, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors - www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration.aspx<http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/BVC14-Administrative-Restoration.aspx> . The filing fee for this form is £69 and the form with payment must be sent to the Treasury Solicitor.

3)  Annual Return form for the year ending 24/03/2012 with its £40 filing fee

Please note, the Accounts for the period ending 31/03/2012 will be due by 24/12/2012

I can confirm that there will be no late filing penalties as the company was struck off the register before the first set accounts became due.

If the company intends to apply for restoration by an Order of Court, the procedure is outlined below:

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court .

Information on both procedures can be obtained on the Treasury Solicitors website ? www.tsol.gov.uk<http://www.tsol.gov.uk/> . or from our website at: www.companieshouse.gov.uk<http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/> (please refer to "Guidance" on our homepage and then select guidance GP4 - Strike off, Dissolution and Restoration").

 If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may use the same name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

Yours faithfully,

Maxine Hartrey
