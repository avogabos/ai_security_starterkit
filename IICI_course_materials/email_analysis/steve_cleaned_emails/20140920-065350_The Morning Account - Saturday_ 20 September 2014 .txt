Government to deliver on tax pledge for Scotland
Following the No vote in the Scottish independence referendum, David Cameron has promised to "honour in full" a pledge to transfer powers over tax to the Scottish parliament. He also said that England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be given greater power to decide their own tax, spending and welfare issues. Ronnie Ludwig, a partner at Saffery Champness, said: "Westminster is going to have to deliver on its pledges. We are going to see almost total devolution of tax powers." However, there is no political consensus yet on the extent of tax powers that should be transferred with Labour so far only offering to extend powers over income tax rates. The Liberal Democrats have suggested devolving powers over IHT and CGT, but Bill Dodwell of Deloitte argues that these two taxes were "not on the table". Richard Rose of BDO said that the prospect of two tax systems within the UK could be very challenging to deal with. "There is a recipe for not only a lot of uncertainty and complexity, but also aggressive tax planning as a result of extensive devolution," said Mr Rose. The Telegraph's James Kirkup looks at the implications of an English tax system and comments that it would make Britain a radically different place, and possibly be the biggest governmental upheaval in modern times. Elsewhere, the Times reports that English regions and cities have used the devolution debate to call on the government to "loosen Whitehall's grip" on borrowing, council tax and business rates and give councils the right to increase local taxes. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, is demanding local powers over stamp duty, business rates, council tax and land tax. He said that he believes London and England’s eight core cities should be given extra powers to match those offered to Scotland. Separately, the Independent reports that banks and financial firms have refused to give guarantees to retain their headquarters in Scotland despite the No vote due to uncertainty around the deals that will be struck between Westminster and Holyrood.

Austerity to continue under any chancellor
George Osborne will need additional tax increases, spending cuts or welfare cuts worth more than £37bn in the first three years of the next parliament, on top of the £8.7bn cut that has already been set out for next year, if he is to balance the government's books, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The think-tank found that austerity would continue under a Tory, Labour or Lib Dem chancellor, but that Mr Osborne had by far the toughest approach to fiscal policy. The IFS said the Conservatives planned to secure an overall budget surplus in the next parliament, with tax revenues sufficient to cover both the day-to-day running costs of the government and capital spending on infrastructure projects. Labour and the Lib Dems, by contrast, have said they would borrow to fund capital projects. A Treasury source said: "This analysis confirms Labour haven't learned their lesson - their policy would mean £28bn of additional borrowing. This would mean higher taxes, higher mortgage rates - and would risk Britain's future economic security. They must never be allowed anywhere near our economy again."

Balls: NHS is Labours priority
Ed Balls has said that Labour will seek to fight the next election on the twin issues of stagnant living standards and safeguarding the NHS. The shadow chancellor said he would not be imposing extra taxes to pay for the health service, but promised to do "whatever it takes to save the NHS". Elsewhere in the Guardian, David Nicholson, the former NHS CEO says that a new tax is needed to fund the NHS. He comments that the time has come to both fix the short-term financial issues and put the NHS on a firm and long-term path for financial sustainability. He suggests the establishment of a hypothecated NHS tax.

Stamp duty should be replaced
The Evening Standard carries a letter from D Bowie, from the University of Westminster, who suggests that stamp duty be replaced by a tax on the seller as a percentage of the value appreciation on sale relative to the original purchase price. The writer explains that this would mean that households could pay the tax when they have significant resources at their disposal.

Call for DRO threshold to be doubled
Research from debt charity CAP reveals that more than 300,000 adults with severe debt problems in the UK are stuck in a limbo in which they are both unable to repay their creditors and unable to afford the £705 bankruptcy fees that would resolve the situation. CAP, along with R3 and others, is calling on MPs to enable more people to use a DRO - for which the fee is just £90. The group are proposing that the current threshold for DRO eligibility be doubled to £30,000.

Selling the farm
Nicola Horsburgh of Johnston Carmichael writes in the Press and Journal about the tax issues involved when selling a farm. Ms Horsburgh explains that famers are often advised to keep farms going at all costs to mitigate inheritance tax upon death, as a farm often qualifies for 100% relief from IHT. However, without careful planning a retiring farmer can face capital gains tax on the sale of the farm, followed by an IHT bill.

Vodafone buys 140 Phones 4u stores
Vodafone has agreed to buy 140 Phones 4u stores, saving almost 900 jobs at the mobile phone retailer that collapsed into administration earlier this week. However, it was also confirmed that there will be 628 redundancies at Phones 4u's headquarters. Rob Hunt, a partner at Phones 4u's administrator, PwC, said: "We have worked rapidly over the course of the week following our appointment to explore interest in the Phones 4u business and we are very pleased to secure a future for a significant number of stores and continued employment for 887 of the Phones 4u people. While this deal remains subject to the approval of the UK courts, we are confident that this represents the best available transaction for the company's creditors."

Scottish hotel sector buoyant
BDO's latest hotel survey shows that revenues across Scotland's hotels were the highest in the UK despite a slight drop in occupancy during June, with Edinburgh overtaking Aberdeen for the first time this year. The monthly survey shows that room yield rose 5.6% to £67.12 north of the Border, well ahead of the UK regional average of £51.22. Rooms in Edinburgh commanded an average price of £81.37, surpassing Aberdeen at £75.31.

Insolvency rate rises
The Economist looks at Britain's insolvency rate commenting that in 2000 it was just 7.4 per 100,000 adults. That grew to 32.4 in 2010 before falling for the past four years. However, it rose again in the second quarter of 2014, to 22.8 per 100,000. "The dip has really bottomed out," said R3. It is noted that young women are more likely to go bust than young men are. Louise Brittain of Wilkins Kennedy says many more women are taking risks as entrepreneurs these days, so more are ending up in trouble. But only a quarter of all personal bankruptcies in the first quarter of this year were of self-employed people. The biggest problem for both men and women is credit-card bingeing, she says.

Tax breaks on growth firms
Amy Crofton of Lesmoir-Gordon, Boyle & Co gives advice on investment in growth firms and says there are plenty of tax incentives. The Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts allow investors to claim an income tax reduction equal to 30% of their investment amounts, although this benefit must be repaid if the shares are sold within three or five years respectively, she explains.

Expat pension options
The Telegraph's Alison Steed looks at the various options open to British expats in light of the change in UK pensions rules planned for next April. She explains that the new rules coming into force will prevent those with pensions in unfunded public schemes, such as the military, police, NHS workers and teachers, from transferring their pension overseas. It means that anyone with savings in one of these schemes – known as defined benefit (DB) schemes – will find themselves at the mercy of exchange rates when it comes to how much they will receive from their pension.
