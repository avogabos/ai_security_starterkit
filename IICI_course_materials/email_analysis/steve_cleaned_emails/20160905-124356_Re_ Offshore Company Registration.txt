Hi Steve

Thanks for the information, we decided to go for a UK company which we have just registered with you.

I requested and paid for Director’s Privacy Service, Company Protection Services and Shareholder Protection Service. Checking with Company’s House and none of these services private. I can see the list of officers, shareholders and filing history listing the Director.

Can you explain this to me please?

Kind Regards

Steve

You’ll need to get things notarised, which means a Notary Public (most often found in solicitors practices) signs and stamps the copy as authentication that it is real. I had to do it once and there was only one in Leicester.
