Dear Steve Smith,

Many thanks for the reply.

On the site of the companiesintheuk.co.uk, stated Oxford Corp Ltd, incorporated on 26 Sept. 2013. What I meant by the Query no. 5 of my letter “What is the concept of the said company?”,  is about the concept of Oxford Corp Ltd.


Further, would like to know, 

1. Once the funds have been raised to the company, will the investors agree to authorize the 
    payment of Broker’s fees, if not do I have to meet that expense personally?


2. Under the “Entrepreneur Starter Pack -FAQs” there is a question as, Who will own the shares ?
    The given answer is, Each investor will have different requirement but a typical deal would 
    involve the investor taking 50% or 225,000 shares for an investment of £225,000. This will 
    leave you owning 50% or 225,000 shares.

    Related to the above answer my query is “Because, of the inability that I find to invest “Will I 
    own 50% by investing an amount of £1”?

3. Will your establishment undertake the secretarial work (of Board meetings) of the company
    for an extra charge?

4. How much is the minimum requirement of  investment for a foreigner to have his own business 
    under the EIS scheme?

     (Reason for me to raise the query No.4 is on your site it is noted “the demand for the VISA’s is 
      high.”, it is understood by me and note, the potential exist to find individuals, but need 
      to convince them) 

In addition to the above, would like to mention,
a.) By reading the page on your site under the heading “Business Pack”, in depth understood about your 
     establishment.

b.) Since, I am a citizen of The Netherlands, visa requirement is unimportant for me to commence a business in UK.

       
c.) I am originally from Sri Lanka and 63 years of age, not professionally qualified, but have some knowledge in 
     Accountancy.
                              
d.) Think that I made an error when inserted my telephone number on your site, if it is so the number has to be ,
     (mobile)   00 31 630 854 152. and Residence > 00 31 20 68 63 742

Hope that you will assist me to form a company under the EIS scheme together with investors to generate good returns.


Regards,
