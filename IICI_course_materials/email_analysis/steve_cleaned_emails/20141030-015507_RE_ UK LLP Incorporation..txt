Dear Steve!
Thanks for your kind message and appreciated the information provided by you.
Re UK LLP, kindly advise on the following:In yr mssge you'v indicated 25 GBP, for registered address among additional services, so said charges are not included in the 600 GBP? If not, then what about government fees, are they included or have to be paid apart?What of the charges for 2nd year onwards?Is the LLP required to file any returns? Is that only related to biz within UK territory? Or even the biz out of UK territory is rquired to be filed?Re nominee partners, I'm afraid the cost involved makes total cost too high. I think you'r also offering Gambia offshore cos. at a cost of 195 GBP, can't 2 Gambia companies do for the members? That still would make an initial cost of 990 GBP.Another option would be 2 individual members, one of them a 3rd person and one would be myself. Would like to know your opinion about any implications for an EU citizen being a member of UK LLP?As to the bank account for the LLP having non UK residents either individuals or corporate (2 Gambia offshore cos.), is it possible to have the account in the UK and what are tax liabilities on the transactions through said account. I'v no problem to come over to the UK for account opening formalities.
Thank you for the Hong Kong ready made co., but I'm afraid I'm not looking for such a high cost set-up.
The Gambia offshore pack could be ok but I'm not comfortable with the account in St. Vincent. The account would be receiving / transfering L/Cs, so should be around Europe for the convenience of L/C documents' handling.
Another option, on your web there are 2 Delaware LLCs with bank account at 1000 GBP, where these companies have the bank accounts?
Thank you in advance for your kind and quick reply.
