Subject: UK (LLP) Limited Liability Partnership
From: Wilf T-P <wilftp@gmail.com>

Dear Seve,

I am about to commence a contract with a company of the Czech Republic and
I need to establish a limited company.

My personal details are:

   - I am a British Citizen
   - I reside in Portugal, and am subject to income taxes there.

Reading the information you provided, I find that the UK Limited Liability
Partnership is the best option for me.

I have the following questions:

   - Am I correct in saying that I will have to declare my income only to
   the Portuguese authorities.
   - Does your company provide a book keeping service? If affirmative, what
   are the charges?
   - You mention that offshore banking is available only in the St. Vincent
   Islands. I can arrange opening of the necessary accounts independent of
   your company, in so doing saving me a high fee. Would your company accept
   this?
   - Would investments in the UK be affected using the UK LLP option.

Best regards,
Wilfred Ten-Pow
