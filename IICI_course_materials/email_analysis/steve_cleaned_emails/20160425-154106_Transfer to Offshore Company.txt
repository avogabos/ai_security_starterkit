Dear Steve,
I hope you are doing well.
I am interesting to transforming my company to an offshore company to avoid
taxes.
I am a German citizen presently residing in Dubai but there is a chance that
I am relocating to the UK soon.
Would be great if you could advise me accordingly.
Many thanks in advance,
Stefanie
