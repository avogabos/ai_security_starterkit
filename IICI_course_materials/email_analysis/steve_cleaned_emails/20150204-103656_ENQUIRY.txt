}Dear Steve,

	Thanks for the short telephone chat.

	I am the chief promoter of an online  Sports Tv project and because
we want it to have a strong  global appeal, we want the company
registered overseas with our office in Nigeria  just an operational
base.

	We plan to call it BrilaSportsTV or BrilaTv. It can also be BrilaWeb
services....just a name that can be registered abroad with an office
address . We want what is legal, on or offshore.....truly legal! 

	We  successfully pioneered Sports radio in Africa and now want a more
challenging  global venture.

	Any ideas?
