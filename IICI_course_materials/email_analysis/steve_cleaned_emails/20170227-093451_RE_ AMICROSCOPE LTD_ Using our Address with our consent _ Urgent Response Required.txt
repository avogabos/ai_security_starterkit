Hi Steve,

 

We are very disappointed about this. We are not UK company and we don't know about those details about different mails. We never know that mails from HMRC for VAT will be singled out of our registered address service.

 

Have you returned the VAT letters? We urgently need those letters. If not, we'd like to have these letters forwarded (you may charge one time fee for this).

 

Is trading address including Value Accounting and OutSource Accounts Department ONLY? I don't want to have other surprises in the future.

Dear Andrew Wu


It has come to our knowledge that your company AMICROSCOPE LTD (Company number 08256434) is using our address as TRADING Address with VAT office WITHOUT our consent and payment for service charges.


Please note that as per our agreement for REGISTERED ADDRESS service you can only use our address to receive official mails for company from Companies House and HMRC (corporation tax) and those will be forwarded to you, for VIRTUAL OFFICE MAIL ONLY can only be use to general mails but it do not include our address to be use as TRADING Address for VAT purpose.

 

Also as per our terms and conditions TRADING ADDRESS, Virtual Officer Mail only and Registered Address are 3 separate services.

 

Therefore please change your company’s trading address and remove our address with VAT office as soon as possible. OR if you wish to use our address as your company’s TRADING address with VAT office then you need purchase following services:

 

-          Virtual Office InfiniOffice Mail only 12 months : GBP 225 (per annum) – you already have this service and it is expiring on 23 Feb 2017.

-          Value Accounting : GBP 300 (per annum)

-          OutSource Accounts Department : GBP 300 (per annum)

 

Note that since you are using our address as TRADING Address without our consent and without paying service charges any mails from VAT office received for company will not be forwarded to you, which can cause company to go into bad standing and government can impose financial penalties on company and we will not be responsible for it. Currently we are receiving mails from HMRC for VAT which we are unable to forward it to you and those have been returned to VAT.

 

Please change company address as soon as possible or if you wish to use our address then please make arrangements as mentioned above.

 

If address is not changed or if we did not receive your response within 3 working days, then we will report it to VAT office.

Note that since you are using our address as TRADING Address without our consent and without paying service charges any mails from VAT office received for company will not be forwarded to you, which can cause company to go into bad standing and government can impose financial penalties on company and we will not be responsible for it. Currently we are receiving mails from HMRC for VAT which we are unable to forward it to you and those have been returned to VAT.
Please change company address as soon as possible or if you wish to use our address then please make arrangements as mentioned above.
If address is not changed or if we did not receive your response within 3 working days, then we will report it to VAT office.
