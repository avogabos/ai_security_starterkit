Subject: FW: STERLING GENT TRADING : Services Reneawal and Annual Filings
From: "Linda | SGTMarkets" <linda@sgtmarkets.com>
To: <steve@formationshouse.com>

Why is our company struck off?  As I understand from the below, we are only
delinquent in filing the Annual Return which was due 18DEC15.  And I do
believe I emailed you that there was no activity in the company and
therefore no annual returns.

 

Please urgently advise.
