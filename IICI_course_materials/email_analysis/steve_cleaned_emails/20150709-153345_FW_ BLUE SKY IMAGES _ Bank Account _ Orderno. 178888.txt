Customer did not completed the bank account procedure. Only online application was finalized in Oct 2014, appointment was not set with Barclays because some information was missing in application.

 

Now do not need the service and asking for refund. Can we deduct GBP 150 as service charge and remaining GBP 350 we will give customer as deposit ?
