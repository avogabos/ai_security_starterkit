Dear Sir

EVENTUS CAPITAL PARTNERS - 08476528

Thank you for your email of  05 October 2015 concerning the restoration of the above company.

The company was struck off and dissolved due to non filing of outstanding documents. Accounts for 30/04/2014 were due to be filed by 06/01/2015 and an annual return for 23/04/2015 due 21/05/2015.

There are two procedures for restoring a companies to the register, which are:
            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
            - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter which costs £64. Information regarding this can be obtained from the B.V. Division of the Treasury Solicitors website - https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/390209/BVC_14_Form_V15__1_.pdf

3)  Annual Return form for the year ending 23/04/2015 and £40 filing fee.

4)  Accounts for the period ending 30/04/2014  together with the late filing penalty of £1500.

Please note the Annual Returns forms can be downloaded from our website www.companieshouse.gov.uk, there are 2 different AR01 forms, if you require any assistance, to ensure the correct form is printed, please telephone our contact centre on 0303 1234500.

We cannot accept a cheque drawn on the company account, as when the company
is dissolved, the company bank account is frozen.

All the required documents and fees should be sent in together, and marked for the attention of the Restoration Section (RT01).

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court .

Information  regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website -
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/treasury-solicitor-s-department and http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk

Please note if there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may use the same name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

Yours faithfully
