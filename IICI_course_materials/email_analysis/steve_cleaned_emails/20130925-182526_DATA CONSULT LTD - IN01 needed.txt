Hello,
I was looking for the IN01 which is needed by my bank to proof that I am listed as the only beneficial owner.
If I download in "MYAccount" the document "Form 10 (Form IN01 for Companies Act 2006)" there is a pakistani name shown as director.
How can I get the document that shows me as director and beneficial owner?
Best regards,
