Hello Steve,
Thank you for your response. Yes for sure we wouldn't have charge backs more than 3%Just a last question before we go ahead, just in case if it goes above it, will we be notified to work on it or the funds will directly be freezed/put on hold along with the sub-merchant account? We generally take an authorization letter and we send the invoice to our clients who are willing to make a payment and we are always open to send those to the merchant provider in case of any dispute.
We will be filling up the info's on the link you provided us tomorrow and shall notify you via email after we are done.

Hello
Steve,



 





We are all
set to go ahead and apply for the GLOBAL MERCHANT STARTER PACK. Please let
me know how shall we go ahead and apply for the same. Also do let me know the
payment mode.





 





Hello
Steve,





 





A couple of
other things which I am looking forward to know is I believe the payments which
we will be processing will be directly deposited to the bank account which we
will be getting along with the GLOBAL MERCHANT STARTER PACK. My question
is how frequently do you settle the funds? Is that on a daily basis or weekly
basis.





 





Also,
please do mention what % of chargeback is allowed because we don't want to get
the accounts freezed or blocked for any such reason. Please mention at length
your chargeback % limits and policies. In the last 3 years we have never has
over 3% chargebacks/refunds but still it's important for us to get clear idea
of your policies before we signup with you.





 





Additionally
could you please explain to me what exactly do I have to mention in the Copy of
Personal Reference Letter.



Looking forward to your quick response so that we can move forward.
