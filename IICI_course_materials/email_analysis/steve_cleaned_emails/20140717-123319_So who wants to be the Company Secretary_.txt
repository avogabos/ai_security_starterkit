Who wants to be the Company Secretary?
WE DO...and we can guarantee you the 
                              highest standards of professionalism when performing 
                              the role!
Dear Steve,
If you've ever had a look through 
                              the ODCE's '
Company Secretaries - Their 
                              Powers and Duties
' publication or '
The Company Secretary
' 
                              booklet produced by the CRO you'll have noticed 
                              the role of a Company Secretary is far from being 
                              straightforward.
The Company Secretary is responsible for a vast array of 
                              official day to day queries and requirements. At 
                              best these can prove to be no more than a distraction 
                              from the core business of the company. At worst, 
                              they can lead to fines, penalties and administrative 
                              heartache.
The role of the Company Secretary is set to become 
                              even more challenging when the new Companies Bill 
                              is passed as it will impose a duty on every company 
                              to ensure that the person appointed as company secretary 
                              has the necessary skills to discharge his/her statutory 
                              and other legal duties. Additionally, the Bill proposes 
                              that the appointee must make a public declaration 
                              acknowledging that he/she has legal duties and obligations 
                              imposed on him/her by the Companies Acts, other 
                              statutes and common law
But fear not, help is at hand.
