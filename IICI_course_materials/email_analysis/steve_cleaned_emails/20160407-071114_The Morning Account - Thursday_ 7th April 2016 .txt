TAX

 

Pressure remains on Cameron over offshore tax

Downing Street has issued a fourth clarification of David Cameron’s tax affairs, stating that he and his family would not benefit in future from any offshore funds, following continued questioning after his father was listed in the Panama Papers leak. Channel 4 News reported that Ian Cameron was a director and shareholder of Jersey-based Close International Equity Growth Fund, prompting further demands that Mr Cameron details whether he has benefitted in the past from tax havens. Elsewhere, the FT points out that the Prime Minister lobbied EU members in 2013 to leave trusts outside a central registry recording the true ownership of shell companies. Meanwhile, the Treasury has issued a statement saying George Osborne and his wife had “no offshore interests at all” after the Chancellor walked away from questions during a television interview asking whether he benefits from offshore funds. A raft of celebrities, sports stars and other high-profile figures have also been exposed in the Panama Papers, including the Duchess of York, Dominic Strauss-Khan, Simon Cowell, Heather Mills, Paul Burrell, Sir Mark Thatcher and Sir Nick Faldo. There is no suggestion of illegal behaviour by any of those mentioned. However, the new president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, is under investigation after documents in the leak revealed suspect dealings relating to TV rights while he worked for Uefa.

This is a story that should be about the US

In a letter to the FT, James Anderson of PAM Insight, Switzerland, says it is ironic that the US is home to the ICIJ and also ranks as the world's fastest growing offshore tax haven. In a separate letter, Anthony Travers, Chairman of the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange, says US transparency standards should be raised to the level of those in the British Overseas Territories. Finally, Kimberley Durrant, the UK Representative for the Government of Bermuda, points out that in Bermuda disclosure standards exceeded those of the UK itself and central registers of beneficial ownership are held and continuously updated.

Tyrie urges clarity to stop banks offsetting fines against tax

Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons' Treasury Select Committee, has asked George Osborne to clarify whether bank fines classified as "compensation" payments to regulators are tax deductible. Although tax rules were changed last year to stop tax deductibility for compensation payments made to customers, Mr Tyrie claims Mr Osborne has suggested in a letter that last year's rule changes may not have caught compensation payments to regulators, which could therefore still be tax deductible. "If so, taxpayers are on the hook for some aspects of a bank's misconduct. That would be unacceptable. I urge you to look again at this," he wrote to the Chancellor.

Will a public register improve transparency?

David Cameron has said a public register that identifies the beneficial or "significant" owners of UK companies will be introduced in June, bringing in “a new era of corporate transparency in Britain” However, lawyers and accountants have warned the register will be ineffective as provisions within the legislation would not apply to overseas companies operating in the UK through a branch and the register will not be independently checked.

Guernsey treasury minister refutes local 'tax haven' status

Guernsey treasury minister Gavin St. Pier has said that Guernsey is not a tax haven, but instead a "low tax jurisdiction" that plays a vital role in international capital markets for those with legitimate business. He was speaking in response to calls for urgent action to crack down on tax havens after the leak of more than 11m files from Panama-headquartered law firm Mossack Fonesca.

Pfizer-Allergan merger scuppered by US tax crackdown

The US Treasury Department’s crack down on “abusive” tax inversions has led to the termination of the $160bn merger between Pfizer and Allergan. Pfizer stood to escape as much as $1bn in tax annually by redomiciling to Allergan’s base in Ireland.

The Panama Papers: public interest disclosure v the right to private legal advice  

Transparency and accountability are worthy liberal principles, suggests the FT's David Allen Green, as are privacy and the ability to obtain confidential legal advice. Elsewhere, the Telegraph’s Juliet Samuel points out that doing business offshore is not a crime. Rather, it is in many cases vital to the smooth operation of global business.

E-books VAT change

INDUSTRY

 

Pressure on professional enablers may increase

Transparency International has called on the UK Government to increase the power of regulators to strip lawyers, accountants and estate agents of their licences if they are found to be knowingly helping corrupt individuals hide their assets using methods such as offshore companies. Several papers comment on whether the Panama Papers leak will simply mean lawyers and accountants have to find even more complex ways of structuring webs of offshore trusts, while increased regulation or risk of security breaches will just make their services more expensive. Some say demand is unlikely to fall, however, others believe many clients will be having serious doubts about whether aggressive tax planning is really worth the trouble.

FinTech helps London to keep global finance title 

The capital’s booming FinTech industry has proved decisive in a global study which indicates that London remains the financial centre of the world, coming ahead of second-placed New York. “Innovation seems to be one of the key factors [in London’s success] and the work being done in FinTech and blockchain technology holds London in a strong position,” said report author Mark Yeandle of the Z/Yen Group. London should continue to “focus on the growth areas of the future, particularly the explosion of FinTech firms,” said Jimmy McLoughlin, head of external relations at the Institute of Directors. The only other European city to make the top 10 in the ranking is Zurich in sixth place; the highest-ranking EU city after London is Frankfurt, in 18th place.

ABAB critical of digital tax account plans

The Administrative Burdens Advisory Board, which scrutinises how HMRC treats SMEs, has declined to endorse new rules requiring small businesses and the self-employed to file tax returns four times a year through online "digital tax accounts" by 2020. In its annual report, the ABAB said it had "significant concerns" that "the proposals for quarterly updates will be more burdensome than they currently are, with increased record-keeping and compliance costs. The position of the board was echoed by FSB chairman Mike Cherry, who said: "When every independent body and expert is lining up to tell you to stop, slow down and think again. It might be time to take a breather and listen to their concerns.” HMRC said the digital accounts would simplify the system and “reduce the burden of updating HMRC for small businesses."

Scotland's economy grows by 0.2%

Scotland's economy grew by 0.2% in the last quarter of 2015, according to official figures.
