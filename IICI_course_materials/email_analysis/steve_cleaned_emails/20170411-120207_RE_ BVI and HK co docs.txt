I have not seen any documents from BVI yet for

 

SOLUCIONES DE ENERGIA INTERNACIONAL (SOLERINT) - when was this ordered or
sent out to us? Maybe ask them for tracking number? 

 

 <javascript:none()> CONDUCTORES Y CABLES GLOBALES (CONDUGLOB) - I haven't
seen anything recently. what documents are you waiting for exactly? Is this
a recent order? 

 

Thanks 

Nadya
