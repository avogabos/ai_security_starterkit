Dear Steve,

Rene checked your customer in the Internet and said that, unfortunately, we
cannot accept them, as they are involved in specific financial activities.
And we have had enough problems with the local police and do not want to
risk any more.
Sorry but I hope you can understand our situation.

Hi Steve.
I replied to you on March 28, 2014 and have not heard from
you since then.
Did you get my reply?
If not, here it is once again:
First of all we need to know the name. If it is fine, then you need
to fill out the order form and have the customer sign the Disclaimer and then
send it to us by email.
If it is a company and not a private person, the price is 48 Euro
per month x 12 months - 20% discount = 460.80 Euro.
Payment options are like always - Paypal or bank wire
.
