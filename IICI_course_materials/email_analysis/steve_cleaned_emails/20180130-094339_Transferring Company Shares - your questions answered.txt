Tuesday's Company from Séan Kavanagh - Company Formations International Ltd January 2018 Dear Steve, Transferring Shares - a very comprehensive package from CFI! Transferring shares from one party to another is one of the most common methods used to change the shareholding structure of a private limited company, and indeed, one of the most popular topics that I get asked about. While the process for making such a transfer may seem relatively straightforward, there are a number of factors that shareholders, directors and practitioners need to be aware of in order to ensure that the transfer is completed correctly. Common queries that I come across range from whether stamp duty needs to be paid, whether there are pre-emption rights on the transfer, how are the Registers updated and what to do when a previous share certificate needs to be recalled for cancellation but has been lost or destroyed.  In addition, since the introduction of e-stamping in 2011, if your transfer does fall within one of the categories that require stamping, it will be necessary to register with ROS, register with e-stamping and set up a ROS Debit Instruction before you can even proceed to lodge the transfer details! Attached to this newsletter you'll find two short information leaflets Transfer of Shares in a Private Company made easy & E-stamping made easy Here at CFI we offer you one of the most comprehensive and economical share transfer packages on the market. In addition to the preparation of stock transfer forms, provision of minutes, new share certificates and the updating of your registers, we look after ALL of your e-stamping requirements – including applications for PPS numbers for non-resident individuals and customer numbers for foreign registered companies. If you would like further information on any of these matters, or if you have a specific transaction that you would like to discuss in more detail, you are most welcome to give either myself or Sue a call, we will be delighted to help you.

Dear Steve,
Transferring Shares
- a very comprehensive package from CFI!
Transferring shares from one party to another is one of the most common methods used to change the shareholding structure of a private limited company, and indeed, one of the most popular topics that
I
get asked about.
While the process for making such a transfer may seem relatively straightforward, there are a number of factors that shareholders, directors and practitioners need to be aware of in order to ensure that the transfer is completed correctly.
Common queries that I come across range
from whether stamp duty needs to be paid, whether there are pre-emption rights on the transfer, how are the Registers updated and what to do when a previous share certificate needs to be recalled for cancellation but has been lost or destroyed.
In addition, since the introduction of e-stamping in 2011
, if your transfer does fall within one of the categories that require stamping, it will be necessary to register with ROS, register with e-stamping and set up a ROS Debit Instruction before you can even proceed to lodge the transfer details!
Attached to this newsletter you'll find two short information leaflets
