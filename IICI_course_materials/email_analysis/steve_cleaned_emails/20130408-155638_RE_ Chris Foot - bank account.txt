He is opening the account for one of the Seychelles only - the other guy

 

Not for his own Seychelles company as he doesn't have great credit history

 

Once the account is open, then he will be added as a signatory

Subject: Chris Foot - bank account

 

Hi

 

 

Chris wants to have 1 bank account for 2 of his offshore companies.

 

 

I told him that there will be 1 bank account for 1 company.

 

 

He is saying that he has spoken to you about it, please advice.
