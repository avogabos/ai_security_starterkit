Hi Mattia
We charge 50
GBP for UK VAT registration and process takes 4-6 weeks.
You can
order the service from your account at our website using the "To order new
products and services click here" link.
In UK, you
should register with HM Revenue & Custom for VAT (value added tax) once
your annual total taxable turnover reaches 70000 GBP threshold. The HMRC
requires a business to register for VAT if it expects the total sales revenue
for the year including the preceding month should equate or go beyond the
threshold.
Also note,
that some services and products are exempted from VAT. You check the details at
www.hmrc.gov.uk
.
As far as
your company is concern, it is ready to use and if the annual turnover exceeds
70000 GBP then you have to register for VAT.
I hope
above information is satisfactory. If you require further information or

Re: GSC METAL & TRADING CO: Company Documents
Hi Steve,
thanks for feed back. How much it cost and how long it would
take to get VAT registration?
Other question: What it mean for the UK law miss the VAT
number? I explain better, till now we have not used the company yet...... but
 ......if we would have used it issuing and receiving invoices, opening
bank accounts, move money in and out......... how could we do it without a VAT
number applied? I wonder if the VAT number for UK comapny has the same meaning
of the rest of Europe, otherwise till now we have had a company not ready to be
used. I'm wrong?
Can you please explain me shortly. Thanks Steve!

Hi
Steve,
thanks
again for sending us the company's documents so quickly. We appreciate!
I
have a short question, which I hope you can answer me. Which is the
"VAT" registration number of our company? I mean..... You know that
the EU companies has a VAT number, which in some cases correspond with the
fiscal code of the company, too.
I
don't know if it is the same for the UK, by the
way, what I need to know is this number or its equivalent of GSC
Metal&Trading Co Ltd. Thanks for your info by return.
