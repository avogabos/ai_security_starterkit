Dear Steve,

Thank you very much for your help I have already deleted the e-mail you created and created the one I needed. It must have been a network problem otherwise I don't know why I couldn't. The only thing is that it does not let me forward the e-mail to the gmail account of the college so that he can get the messages of his mobile devices. 
It keeps returning the message "this account arrays exists". Any Ideas?

As far as the unique reference number for the HMRC I have one for my self assessment since last year when I moved to the UK.  Would that do for the company as well? 
I use that for self assessment until now. 

Pls let me know 游땕

Thank you in advance as always for your valuable help.

Dear MAria
I just made a dummy email account on your domain which is
'stevetestingpop@mbcapitalventuresltd.com
', you can login, check and delete.
You need to login to MY ACCOUNT, select Domain Hosting and Email Admin, click once on domain name to select, then click on Email POP Accounts, type Email ID and Password and click ADD.
Regarding CT41G no it will not confuse HMRC, it will just give them an idea that they are slow in their work. :-)
Let me know about email creation and have a nice weekend.
Regards
Steve...
