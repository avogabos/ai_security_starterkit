Subject: client for managed company service

 

Business Activity: startup company for online simulation game for managing
green environment

 

2 directors, Pakistani nationals, one director resident of Canada and other
of Pakistan.

 

 

 

Need UK company registration, bank account, mailing address and annual
filings services

 

 

For UK bank account then can visit UK- they will have to but unless they
have an exiting barlsays or hsbc relationship its going to be hard as they
don't live here,

 

Otherwise they may go for Euro Pacific, can Euro Pacific receive online
payments via PayPal or any other service providers? Europacific are red
flags on Pakistan, however they will look at it and see, but its tricky

Maybe be better they stick with the Canada one, and have a private legal
agreemet for the other, and later add him as a shareholder

 

 

 

Also have shown interest in Managed Company Service. Through our Collection
Service can we handle:

 

-          On Daily basis : 50-75 invoices between GBP 5-1000, total daily
collection GBP 3500-5000 - where are the payments coming from? And what for?
How do they sell their services

 

-          How much time we will take to transfer payment to his account,
can it be done on daily basis? 7- 14 days clearance, but can be daily.
Really depends on where its from and we will what to see invoices and id
docs in some cases to for the people remitting funds,

 

 

 

Please advice
