Dear Steve,
Gambia? No. I'd rather do that of the UK. If the docs sent are Ok, let's do UK registeration. 
How much should I initially pay? 
I am able to transfer to your nominated account.

We have checked and company name ‘Brilasportstv Limited’ is
provisionally available for registration in United Kingdom.
Please note, we will need scan copy of your passport and
proof of address to proceed with the registration. We will not be able to
process company registration until we have all the required documents as scan
copies. This is for UK company registration.
And for offshore Seychelles company registration we will
need notarized scan copies as we well hard copies.
