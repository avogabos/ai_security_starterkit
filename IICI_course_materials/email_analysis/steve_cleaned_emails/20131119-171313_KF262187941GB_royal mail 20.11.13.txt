Hi

 

 

There might be problem because I think you signed the previous documents and
name change resolution is signed by customer.

 

Sign could mismatch, so I am sending you a blank copy, so that you can sign
and signature should not differ with companies house records.

 

I hope this will resolve the issue.

 

Thank you for your time and support.

 

Regards

Dear Steve

 

I've checked the letter properly, all the information that they needed was
received, however they need 1 more item.

 

Documents Required: To comply with the Companies Act 2006 you must also
submit the following documents to allow us to complete the change of name
for your company 

. Resolution to change company name

 

Support can help your draft this document, but it probably need the
customers signature.

 

With Regards, Tahir
