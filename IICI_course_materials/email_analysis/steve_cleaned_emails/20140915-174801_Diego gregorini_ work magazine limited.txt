Hallo mr. Steve
We would like to know the price and time to re open our company called Work Magazine Limited ,we need the vat code and to open a bank account in England or better in Ceka Repubblic.
Another option is to buy a company already existing.
For kenya i was asking to you if  is possible to open a company in England and using it in Kenya to produce food products there. 
Best regards
Fabio Cazzato and Diego Gregorini
