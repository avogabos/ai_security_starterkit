Hi,

 

Please note that initially we received 425 GBP by bank transfer from the
client from which 300 GBP was balance with us. Original Payment reference is
11/14/2014 SALDO FT. PRO FO RBSDM2I15253625 FUSO NOEMI ITL 418  (Confirmed
by Preeti- Payment Received by Bank).

 

Later on 200 GBP from the balance was utilized for other services and since
then the remaining balance is 100 GBP.

It seems that client has not received the amount which was refunded. 

 

Email from client is as follows:

 

"Very sorry to inform you that, up to-day, none amount have been credited on
my accout. 

 

Please send me copy of your bank receipt"

 

Could you please check and advise.

 

Thank you

I thought this was approved already, I don't know how they paid so I assumed
t was done through the merchant account
