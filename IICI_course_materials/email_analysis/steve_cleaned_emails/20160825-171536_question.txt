Dear Steve,

I hope that all is well with you.

How is the final stage of MB Capital Ventures paperwork for the filling going? Have you received the company numbers you need from HMRC?

I wanted to ask you about adding two people that work for me and setting up their e-mail via the server.
Is there any problem with it?
I try to add the e-mail address and it keeps shutting me out and the message reads “invalid password” even tough I am setting up an new account.

Can you please help me out with this?
I did set up last year 2 e-mails for colleagues which later on I deleted and they were set up ok with no problems.
Has something changed since then?

Pls help..

Thanks a lot in advance.

Maria
