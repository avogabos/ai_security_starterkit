Hello Steve,
I am back in Europe now.  Unfortunatley I have not heard anything back in regards to the opening of the bank account. Our clients can't issue us payment without this, so it's getting quite urgent.  As I'm back in Europe I could come to London if need be to meet with the bank.  I just will need notice to rearrange my appointments.
Thank you
