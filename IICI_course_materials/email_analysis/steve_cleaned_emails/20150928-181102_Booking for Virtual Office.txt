Hello Steve,

My name is Rucha and I work for a Health and Nutrition Company. I need to
book for a Virtual Office at Harley Street London. I went on the website
but the order form seems to not open.

I want to book for an InfiniOffice 500 package for a period of 3 months
where in I need an London based phone number which will be diverted to my
number, an Office postal address at Harley Street London, As well as mail
postage and fax forwarding by email.

Can you please help me book for the same for a period of 3 months from 1st
Octover 2015?

Thanks and kind regards,
Rucha Sane
