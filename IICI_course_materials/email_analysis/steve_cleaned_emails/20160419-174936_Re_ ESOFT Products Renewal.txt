Hi Rana
Payment received for renewal.
Seems like somebody already filed application for change in address for
Mrs. Rana Risheh and this change has been updated.
Now to complete annual return, please see the attach file and provide SIC code (Business Activity) that will be submitted with annual return.
Once I have the SIC code, I will file annual return for ESOFT LTD and send you the procedure for online payment.
Steve…

I hope my email finds you well.
I think some of ESOFT LTD products have been expired, can you please send the invoice to renew the following:
