Thank you for contacting us through our website. Our website is aimed at  
professional practices and provides basic information on most offshore  
jurisdictions, helping them to advise clients or refer them to suitably  
qualified practices that can do so. It is also aimed at individuals seeking  
professional advice where they need it.
We offer 2 levels of service:
1)	Execution only \u2013 where we set up a specific offshore Company on request  
with any required supporting bank account. The individual(s)/Companies will  
be fully responsible for obtaining tax advice in their country of residence  
with particular attention being paid to Corporation Tax rules on management  
and control of offshore Companies and its implications, and on the taxation  
of an individual on any funds extracted from the Company.

2)	A tax consultancy service where we evaluate the needs of an individual and  
their business and advise on the most suitable structure for their  
circumstances. This is a paid for service. Our standard fee is USD 200.00 per  
hour and it would normally take between 2-8 hours to conduct the review,  
depending on the complexity of structure required and the residency situation  
of the individual.
