Dear Charlotte,

 

This application seems to be in order.

 

Please remember to also fulfill the due diligence requirements for each
director, shareholder and beneficial owner of the company for the bank
purposes.  The requirements are listed on the first page of the application.

 

Once these are in order, then you must send all documentation to us in
Belize.

 

Best regards,

 

Mitch
