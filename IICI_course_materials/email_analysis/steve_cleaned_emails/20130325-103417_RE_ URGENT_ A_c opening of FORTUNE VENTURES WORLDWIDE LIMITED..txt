Dear Siddartha,

 

Although I have not responded to last weeks emails due to a heavy workload, I have been in contact with the bank to push them as much as possible. I agree that they have taken far too long and have raised inconsequential queries. I referred to this bank as in the past they have been flexible and provided good service, but I have to agree that they have not provided you with good service. You paid us £500 for bank account opening and as a gesture of good will I have asked Steve to credit  your account to use the £500 for other future services. If they cant open the account then I will look at an alternative such as an offshore bank account with merchant services. 

 

Again I apologise for the inconvenience caused by the bank and I shal continue to chase them this week until I have an answer.

 

Warm Regards

 

Charlotte Pawar

Dear Mr. Raj,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta. Hope you had a wonderful weekend!!!!
In reply to your last mail I had sent you the prime 5 objectives of the company. 
I firmly believe that you will with me in regards to my answers to the Bank's
queries. The fact is :
We have formed a company to do some busniess , mainly as stated in my previous mail,
but if the Bank wants me to confirm one than either I have to tell a lie or I need to tell
something wrong. Depending on the maturity and success we shall go ahead. The main
thing which remains common is --- Legally , ethically Keeping the Law of the land and 
maintaining the Banking ethics.
Other than this I cannot gurantee anything as off now. I hope I am clear in my expression??
Now its upto the Bank to decide.
 
You have a great time ahead. God Bless.

Dear Dr Das Gupta,

 

Thanks again for your email, I am a bit confused as on the document you sent back you have said that you will purchase stock from India but on the original forms you said that you will be providing consultancy to businesses. What the bank are trying to establish is what the business will be doing. I  apologise if I have missed understood the business concept. RBS would like to do business with you but due to the compliance changes that the FSA have placed on banking we need to comply. I totally understand what your are saying but I just need to understand the business Model.

 

 

Kind Regards

Dear Mr. Raj,
 
Heartiest Greetings . This is the first time  my mail could enter your inbox . Is it a Good sign ?
I was given a set of questions and I have given my honest answers to it at least 6 to 7 days back.
 
Kindly let us know whether the Account could be opened or not ?? 
I have nothing against you  Mr. Raj but there are some questions which are childish.
A person starting  a business does not have the right to open his account in RBS ??? If not
it should be stated that only Experienced and OLD & RICH -Organisations will be entertained, in RBS.
 
I would earnestly request you to forward both my mails to your Head Office and who may be the person
concerned for his replies. I do understand and believe that you guys are presurrised with Targets and Volumes.
Is this the way ????
 
 
Anyway I am eagerly waiting for your early reply and action.





With best regards and compliments.

Re  : Opening of our current account for Fortune Ventures Worldwide Limited.
 
Dear Mr. Raj,
 
Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta.
 
I hope this mail gets an entry to your inbox because till date all the mails I had sent to you bounced back for reasons unknown.
 
Hope everything is fine with you and your Business.
 
It was on probarbly  19th of Jan 2013 we had an appointment with you at your Branch.
We had given all our documents for Opening our account. We were referred to you by  Ms. Charlotte of Formation House.
If I remember you were kind enough to complete all the basic formalities in front of us and told us that it would  take 10 days
to open the account.
It was on 7th of Februrary 2013 when you called me and asked for some other address proof. I had asked you what was the reason pf such delay,
I remember you  telling me  that only the fresh address proofs will be required and once you get it it would be very soon.
 
Till then I have been waiting and there has been no communication from your end.
 
Approx. after 45 days of waiting Mr. Raj Can I ask you some of my queries ???
 
1. Are we elligible to have an account in your Esteemed Bank ?
2. If Yes then why is such delay ??? If there is requirement of any document then why are we not informed about that ??
3. If the answer to the first question is No --- I would request you to spare a few spare moments of your precious time-- Dont you feel
    one simple line of mail stating ---- "The Bank is unable to accept your application" would be  concluding enough for us to not wait
   unnecessarilly ????  It would have saved our TIME, which happens to be the costilest thing in this Palent Earth.  
4. I would request you to kindly retrun all the documents which we had given you for the account opening, at the earliest.
5. I do hereby authorise  Mr. Bruno Machado to collect the documents from you as per your suitability.
6. I hope that you will agree that our documents will be a burden for your Bank and we dont want that to happen so requesting you to
    kindly give back all the documents ASAP.
 
With stunning regards and best wishes.
