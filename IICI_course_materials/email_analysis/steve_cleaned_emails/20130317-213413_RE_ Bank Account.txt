17.03.2013 Dear Mr. Steve,Greetings from Siddhartha Das Gupta. I am really surprised & astonished to receive your mail. Dont take me wrong perhaps this is one of the reasons why UK is under such recession !!!!!!How can a Bank come back with idiotic questions like this ??? Does the Bank mean to say that no fresher can start a business, do everyone need to have an experience ??? Where will the experience come from if he is not allowed to start a business.  This is absolutely bull shit, I am sorry . The person Mr. Raj who dealt with us kept all my Bio Data which is a small format of a book, he called me up on 07.02.2013 asking me a fresh address proof which I sent him immediately. When I asked him that day he said all is done only a new address proof wil be required.After one month how can they ask for such thing, who is going to give interest on my small amount of 500 GBP paid on the day one for the account which is still lying unused  ?????? I do thank you sending me answers to the query but in response to the answers of the question no 2 & 3 my reply will be ----- NOTHING ( No Experience ) , My friend Bruno --has no history ??? Kindly do write that and get back all the documents and scanned copy which I had given to the Bank.I shall wait for 2 days if it is not done ,kindly make arrangements to return all our original documents.With due respect Mr. Raj  of RBC, Hey Market Branch, seem and pretends like the Prince of Wales --- what is he upto ??? He never bothers to pick up the phone , never does he replies to the sms sent. He is paid , salaried staff of RBC and its his duty to give service to the clients on behalf of the Bank.After 48 hrs from tomorrow I shall complain to the Head office of the Bank and ask them to check the behaviour of Mr. Raj , whether I am saying anything extra about him ????  He is just an employee, we will keep money or transact why do we need to go to him ??? He should come to us ??? Kindly do ask  Mrs.Charlotte to come back with her reply. I had also sent mails several times but never did I receive a reply. I believe their is no dues with us in lieu of your services, rather I have not utilised many services which you are supposed to give as per the commitments made. I sincerely await for an full and constructive reply from your end at the earliest.Sorry for anything said wrong ( which I believe I have written the truth)  With best regards and compliments.
