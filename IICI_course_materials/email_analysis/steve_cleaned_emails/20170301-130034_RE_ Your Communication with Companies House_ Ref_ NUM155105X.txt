Dear Sir/Madam

FLIGHTS AND HOLIDAY PRIVATE LIMITED 09249683

Thank you for email of 28/02/2017 concerning the above mentioned company.

The company was struck off the register for non-filing of statutory documentation.

There are two procedures for restoring a company to the register, which are:

            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)

            - Order of Court to restore the company to the register.

If you wish to administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  The Bona Vacantia waiver letter, details can be found on the Government Legal Department Bona Vacantia Department www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

3) Annual Return Form AR01 for the year ending 06/06/2016 with filing fee of £40

4) Accounts for the period ending 31/10/2015 with late filing penalty of £750

We cannot accept a cheque drawn on the company account, as when the company is dissolved, the company bank account is frozen.  If you wish to pay by credit /debit card please
  state this in your covering letter when returning the form. We will then contact you by telephone to take the payment details, once all the documents have been received in an acceptable form.

All the required documents and fees should be sent to us marked for the attention of the Restoration Section (RT01).

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, information can be found on the Government websitewww.gov.uk/guidance/company-restoration-guide.

The costs are £300 for the treasury solicitor’s fee, plus court and legal fees.

If the company is being restored only to recover assets, we will not require accounts or annual returns to be filed, there will not be late filing penalties.

We will require documents to be filed to show any change of the registered office address, or any changes relating to the officers of the company.

The procedure usually eight to ten weeks to restore the company, after the company is restored you may release the assets held in the company name.

Once the assets are released we will require a form DS01 and £10 fee to be filed, to begin the process of dissolving the company.

If the assets are solely money in the company bank account, and the amount is less than £3000,  and you do not wish to restore the company to the register, please contact the
  Government Legal Department Bona Vacantia Division on 0207 210 4700 for further information.

 

Yours faithfully
