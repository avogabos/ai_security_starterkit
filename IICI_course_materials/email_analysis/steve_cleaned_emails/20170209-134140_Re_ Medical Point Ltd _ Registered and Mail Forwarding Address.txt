Hi Steve,

Sorry for the delay in coming back to you.

I have asked our accountants to change the registered address and will 
not be requiring this service from your company.

We will continue using your correspondence only service as normal.

Please come back to me if there's anything further.

Please note that as per

Also as per our terms and

Therefore please change
                your companys registered address
                and remove our address as soon as possible. OR if you
                wish to use our address

                payment of GBP 150
                along with following information and documents:

            received for company
            will not be forwarded to you, which can cause company to go
