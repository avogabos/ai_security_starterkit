Nadya & Steve,

I spoke to the client and I had to tell him that we weren't set up for his operations.


The two challenges that I uncovered from my call with him is that he's dealing with a lot of oil companies in the middle east, and currently we are trying to limit our exposure to clients receiving payments from that area. Now that in of itself is not a hard decline, but combine that with the intention of large, one off payments from his clients, and his inability to give me exact example transactions.


My hope for the call was to ascertain exactly what clients and suppliers he needed to pay, how much, and how often, so that I can run it by Compliance and push it through. Without this information, I concluded it's best if he seeks a larger institution that has the compliance to handle these operations.


Let me know if you have any questions. I'm being comprehensive because you're an important partner and I want to set the right expectations for future similar cases!

Majid,
Thank you for your time today, and your understanding.
We concluded that currently Euro Pacific Bank cannot meet your type of business operations at this time, and a more suitable bank would be a larger institution that is accustomed to oil and gas operations, especially if your wire transfers are going to be large.
