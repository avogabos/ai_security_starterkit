Good day Steve,

I do have some complications understanding the term. Kindly guide me
through it and adjust my order accordingly. My requirements is to have;

a) To have a director name (not from my own)
or
To have a director name (from my own but based in my own country)
b) To have a non UK bank account

Also, transfer of GBP 3,530 will be transferred latest by tomorrow.

Thank you and hope to hear from you soon.
