Non-dom rule change proposals get mixed response
Several papers carry letters commenting on Labour’s tax policies. A Telegraph reader says Ed Miliband’s proposals on mansion tax and abolishing non-dom status are more to do with ingratiating himself with his Union paymasters than raising significant revenues. In the Standard, Panmure Gordon’s David Buik says Ed Miliband and Ed Balls’ vindictive style of taxation will raise peanuts and drive US and European banks away from London. In the Independent, a former public sector worker who worked abroad on a modest salary for a few years says grafters will be hit by changes to non-dom rules, not the super-rich. A Mr Broder asks in the FT whether Labour’s proposal, which essentially treats all who stay as domiciled, will have a balancing rule stating that all who have left, and declared they will not return, will be treated as non-domiciled. Separately, the Telegraph’s Peter Spence cites a paper from the Adam Smith Institute which claims Labour plans to scrap non-dom rules "risks cutting off the country's nose to spite its face" while the Standard’s Rosamund Urwin believes non-doms’ status is indefensible, and they know it. Elsewhere in the Telegraph, Allister Heath says the services sector – a key driver in Britain’s economy – would be hit by anti-London taxes and that “politicians of all parties need to back off, and allow our financial and business services industry to expand much more quickly.” Meanwhile, the Independent’s Mark Steel says Tory squeals over the plans are a gift to Labour. Finally, Jonathan Russell, member of the UK200Group, says he “would rather have the super-rich in the UK spending money here and paying VAT on those purchases and forego possibly squeezing the last bit of income tax out of them, rather than risk them taking that spending power elsewhere in the world.”

Karren Brady backs Tory tax stance
Writing in the Telegraph, Karren Brady says she will be backing the Conservatives as they understand that business is “a force for good”. Baroness Brady hails Tory support for small businesses and says the Diverted Profits Tax sends a clear message: “If you make a profit here, you will pay your taxes here.” She adds that under Labour, multinationals were dodging their tax, families paid more tax, and sole traders were suffocated by red tape.

HSBC ordered to pay €1bn in bail in Swiss case
HSBC has been asked to pay €1bn in bail after the bank was placed under criminal investigation by French authorities for alleged tax evasion. The investigation relates to alleged tax evasion at HSBC's Swiss bank in 2006 and 2007. The bank said that the decision was "without legal basis and the bail is unwarranted and excessive".

Beware fake invoices
Financial Fraud Action UK has warned that computer malware hidden in fake invoices is being used to steal businesses' banking details and that the activity has intensified in recent weeks. Fraudsters email the invoices on text or spreadsheet documents to firms, claiming to be from a regular supplier or a trusted organisation. Opening triggers instructions which log the company’s financial data. The fraud operates because victims unwittingly enable a macro on their computer system when they think they are opening the invoice. It contains malicious software which steals online banking details and other financial information and sends them back to the fraudster. This information is then used to access the firm's bank account. Separately, the BBC reports on a pensioner who lost £18,000 in another banking scam.

Divorce case could set precedent
Alison Sharland has been given permission to appeal to the Supreme Court over her divorce settlement with IT entrepreneur Charles Sharland. Mrs Sharland was awarded a £10.35m settlement in 2012, but is now appealing on the grounds that her husband failed to disclose the possible float of his company when the judge was considering the size of the settlement. Lawyers believe that if Mrs Sharland is successful in winning a bigger share of the marital assets the courts may become deluged with claimants seeking to reopen cases on similar grounds.

Growth confidence falls amid election fears
The latest quarterly Enterprise Index from Smith and Williamson found a fall in business owners expecting the UK economy to improve over the next 12 months – from 90% a year ago to 71%. Fears of Greek exit from the eurozone and the uncertainty around the forthcoming general election have all contributed to the loss in confidence. "It's not an easy environment for people to feel confident in," said Guy Rigby, head of entrepreneurial services at Smith & Williamson. "The major factor here is that we have an election coming up. Many are concerned that one of the parties is anti-business and this is affecting their investment decisions."

ECONOMY

Trade gap widens
ONS figures show that the UK trade deficit widened in February by more than predicted. The trade deficit in goods and services worsened to £2.86bn from £1.54bn in January. The deficit in goods was £10.34bn, up from £9.17bn in January, which was partly offset by a surplus of £7.5bn on services. Goods exports were £23.16bn, the lowest total since September 2010. For the quarter to the end of February, the ONS said exports to the EU were at their lowest since records began in 1998, leaving the EU goods deficit at a record high of £21.1bn, due mainly to a fall in oil exports. UK trade figures show the extent of import and export activity. The figures may raise concerns that the economy remains too dependent on consumer spending, which accounts for more than 70% of economic activity. Separately, a REC/KPMG report finds skills shortages are driving up pay especially in the Midlands and the South. Bernard Brown, of KPMG, said: "This pervasive skills shortage could put the brakes on economic growth if it continues unabated."

Interest rates pegged
The Bank of England (BoE) has held interest rates for 0.5% for another month. The decision by the Monetary Policy Committee comes more than six years after the record low was introduced. Expectations of a rise any time this year have been put on hold with Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation at zero.
