Hi Steve,

May I know when you did send the company documents? I am still waiting for
documents to receive, but have received nothing so far. Did you ship it by
Royal Mail?

Also, what are the terms and conditions of putting my company on hold(or
dormant state)? Asking it because I am thinking to continue my study so I
am not sure If would be able to work and study at the same time.


Kind Regards,
Farkhat J.
