Hi Steve


Can you confirm that our Year End accounts y/e March 31st 2015 are due at the end of December 2015.


Would you mind resending the Excel sheet you need completing for this task and when is the last date to give you this completed sheet.


Also, please confirm the costs for this task.


Finally can you let me have the UTR for Advanced Cloud Solutions LLP.


Many thanks

Chris
