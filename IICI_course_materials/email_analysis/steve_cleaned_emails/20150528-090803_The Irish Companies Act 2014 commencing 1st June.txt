Dear Steve,

As you may be already aware, the new Companies Act 2014 in Ireland is being commenced into law on the 1st of June 2015. The Act is being introduced to simplify company law, reduce administrative burden on limited companies and to ensure good corporate governance. This new act will help to reinforce Ireland’s position as one of the leading global jurisdictions for inward investment, new incorporations and a favourable tax environment.

Some of the main features that the Act will introduce include:

A Private Limited Company (LTD) can now have a single director, once a separate Secretary is appointed
A single-document Constitution will replace the Memorandum and Articles of Association for an LTD, which will permit a company to trade in any legal business (removal of objects clause)
A new company type ‘Designated Activity Company’ (DAC) will be introduced
Mergers , Divisions and Re-Registrations of Companies will be simplified
Directors duties will be simplified and will now be categorised into offences ranked on a scale from 1 to 4
