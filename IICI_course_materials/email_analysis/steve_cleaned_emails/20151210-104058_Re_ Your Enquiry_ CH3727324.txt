Dear Sir

THE STICKING POINT RESOLUTION LIMITED   No. 8909080

Thank you for your email.

The company was dissolved as it did not reply to enquiry letters which were issued when it failed to file its annual return for 24 February 2015. The letters were issued on 1 April, 6 May 2015 and 29 September 2015 to the company's registered office address and to the director's service address.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file the following documents and fees:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual return for 24 February 2015, with a filing fee of £40.00.

3) Accounts for the period ending 28 February 2015. There are no late filing penalties for these accounts as they became outstanding after the company was dissolved.

4) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered online at https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waiver-letter-wa1

Yours faithfully

Catherine Powell
