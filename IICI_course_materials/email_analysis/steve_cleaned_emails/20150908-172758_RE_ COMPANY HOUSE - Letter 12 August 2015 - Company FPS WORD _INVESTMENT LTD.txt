dormant and Annual Accounts and Tax Return will be accordingly.

the sum of £ 425.00, as per Pro-Forma dated 11/11/2014 (here attached Pro-Forma
and Bank tansfer copy),  but according to your conditions, the payment due
to you have been considerably higher as due to the service provided by you. The
value accounting service was charged for £ 300, it was a mistake : the company
was dormant and the cost of service should be only £ 75.00 !

> Due to this mistake my payment on 12/11/2014 was
higher than as due and I am now  in
credit for the major amount paid.

speedy and  clear reply  on the matter.
