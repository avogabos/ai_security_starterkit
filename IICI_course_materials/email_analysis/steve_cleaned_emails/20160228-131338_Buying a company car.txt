Hi Charlotte


We are thinking of buying a company car to share across the partners.


Can you give us some advice as to the best - most tax efficient way of purchasing the car without incurring too much finance costs, such as interest.


I think our options are:

  *   ??Company lease
  *   Personal loan/lease
  *   Buy outright initially

Many thanks

Chris
