Hi Elena

 

Okay, I can arrange 2 accounts, but your clients will be able to access the invoices.

 

 

And if you are only worried about incoming email messages, for this no need for 2 accounts just ask your clients to configure emails on outlook or they can check email messages from our web portal.

 

 

Waiting for your advice.

For emails, you can access email messages through our website or you can configure Outlook. Use the help section available in domain management section to configure emails on Outlook.

 

 

If you wish to give access for domain management directly to client, then we can have 2 separate accounts. Let me know if you wish to have separate accounts.

Dear Steve,

 

The passport is not expired, it is the date of issue if you refer to the 16.08.2001. An internal passport is being changed depending on the age of its holder ending with 0 and 5 (ex. 45, 60).

Attached is a utility bill for May 2013, but it is in Russian. The surname and the address I marked with yellow. Is there anybody in your office who understands Russian so as to confirm you the information on it?

 

Kind regards,

Dear Elena

 

Thank you for the documents.

 

Unfortunately, the address on the passport seems that passport is pretty old and expired. And bank statement also do not show the address and the account is in company’s name.

 

Please send us the personal bank statement or credit card statement of the passport holder where we can easily verify the address.

 

Sorry for the trouble, but we have to follow the due diligence terms and conditions as set by UK Law.

Dear Steve,

 

Thank you very much for your detailed message. Yet I probably need you advice. 

 

The InfiniOffice 500 seems more extended than the client needs. I will describe you the idea of the client. In fact, they wish an “image” of the office rather than the possibilities, which InfiniOffice 500 offers, i.e. they wish to put tel. number, email and a postal address on their companies’ letterhead. So in case that someone calls the number/sends an email/posts an envelope,  the contact details have to be within reach with possibility to respond. Instead of live answering they could do with answer machine and/or call redirection to their local number.

 

Based on the described could you offer something more suitable for the client?

 

Thank you very much in advance.

Kind regards,

Elena

RE: RE: ordering and using credit
Dear Elena
Thank you for the documents.
Unfortunately, the address on the passport seems that passport is pretty old and expired. And bank statement also do not show the address and the account is in company’s name.
Please send us the personal bank statement or credit card statement of the passport holder where we can easily verify the address.
Sorry for the trouble, but we have to follow the due diligence terms and conditions as set by UK Law.
Waiting for your reply.
Regards
Steve

RE: RE: ordering and using credit
Dear Steve,
Thank you very much for your detailed message. Yet I probably need you advice.
The InfiniOffice 500 seems more extended than the client needs. I will describe you the idea of the client. In fact, they wish an “image” of the office rather than the possibilities, which InfiniOffice 500 offers, i.e. they wish to put tel. number, email and a postal address on their companies’ letterhead. So in case that someone calls the number/sends an email/posts an envelope,  the contact details have to be within reach with possibility to respond. Instead of live answering they could do with answer machine and/or call redirection to their local number.
Based on the described could you offer something more suitable for the client?
Thank you very much in advance.
Kind regards,
Elena
