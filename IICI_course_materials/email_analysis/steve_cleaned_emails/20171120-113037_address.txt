Hi Steve

Just to check this is still the correct registered address for Staff Travel
Voyage Limited

[image: Inline images 1]


Or is it this one:

The registered office of the Company is situated at the offices of MAYFAIR
TRUST GROUP
LIMITED, Second Floor, The Quadrant, Manglier Street, P.O. Box 1312
Victoria, Mahé,
Seychelles.


I recall a previous email saying the original address on the top had not
changed becuase the company was formed previous to a particular date,
appreciate if can confirm.


Also is there a postcode?

Best
Phil
