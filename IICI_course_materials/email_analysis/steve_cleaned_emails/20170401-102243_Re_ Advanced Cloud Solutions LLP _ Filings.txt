Hi Steve

We did mail the accounts yesterday to Companies House. Did we need any kind of letter with instructions?

If so we may have to send them again.

Please advice
Thanks
Chris

Dear Chris



Last time too it was done manually because Companies House has not introduced automated functionality for filing LLP annual accounts yet.



You can sign the documents and send hard copies back to us by and we will post it to Companies House.
