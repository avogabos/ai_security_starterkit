Hi Steve,

Courier shipments are paid for separately and prior to forwarding.
The cheapest but still reliable option would be TNT (it is part of the
Swiss Post). The shipment cost will be 90 CHF (ca. 73 Euros as of today).
Other couriers like DHL, UPS or FedEx will be much more expensive.

Hi Steve.
You are really early - we have got it already (in the
morning) ;-)
Should be send it to South Africa just by regular mail
(priority)?

A
DHL shipment going direct to the agent in Switzerland [i.e Sovereign
International, BCB Bachstrasse
1,Butschwil, Switzerland, CH-9606] and not to the Zurich
Aargauerstrasse address as per your advice previously.  The DHL tracking
number is 5984527743 and this correspondance is important and I need this
forwarding via post to the new address I gave you in South Africa please.
  Just wanted to confirm this.
Thanks
and regards
Steve
