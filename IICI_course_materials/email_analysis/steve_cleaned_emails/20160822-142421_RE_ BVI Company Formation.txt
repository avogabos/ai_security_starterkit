Thanks for the info Steve, but a ready-made BVI company is really the first choice so I will check with Mr Butcher and come back to you.

Hi Steve,



I was dealing with your sales department to arrange an appointment and tried to call this morning but there seems to be an issue on the lines.



Anyway I am writing regarding my associate, Samuel Butcher, who I referred to yourselves as I am an existing Formations House customer. Your name was on the email from you that he forwarded to me.



He is very new to this and has asked me to step in and help move things along. The online process and forms are a little onerous and further complicated by the fact that he is a US resident and therefore falls under the FATCA arrangements. He is very happy to comply in every way but this needs to be handled correctly. The purpose of the company is purely for anonymity in proprietary technology and not for any avoidance of financial responsibility.



The best thing is to do this at your office. This afternoon would be great or as soon as you can. Please let me know.



He will bring his British passport and proof of US address by way of bank statements. Is there anything else needed?



He is looking for a ready made BVI company that was initially incorporated no later than 2011.



Sincerely,

Michael Harris
