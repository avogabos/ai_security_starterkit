Steve... here are two+ very important dates for your company diary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ireland's Company Incorporation Specialists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear SteveKeeping you fully up to date about the Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements
of the Companies Act 2014

In this month's Ezine I'd like to draw your attention to not one but...
...two+ very important company legal administration dates in 2016.

Could I urge you to mark both of these dates in your diary now,  immediately, while
they are both fresh in your mind.

You see, both of these dates relate to an important decision that affects just about
ALL existing Irish registered private companies that are limited by shares.

* Your first date for your diary is the 31st August of this year
- which is closer than you might think.

* Your second date for your diary is three months later, on the 30th November of
 this year, and this is a deadline date which Companies Registration Office (CRO)
in Ireland has warned everyone not to overlook!

So important are these two dates in relation to your Company Designation and Company Conversion requirements of the Companies Act 2014,
that I'd added an extra calendar page below for your consideration.

My reason for including this extra call-to-action calendar page is because some 
days ago Companies Registration Office (CRO) in Ireland warned that as we get closer
to the  30th November 2016 deadline the expectation is that there will be a gigantic
upsurge in the number of applications being submitted for processing - so much so
that CRO may not be able to process all of them in time to beat the cut-off deadline
of the 30th November.

Whatever you do, don't let this happen to you or to any limited company that you
have a responsibility for... or an interest in.

With such important changes happening this year, I'd particularly like you to know
that you are very welcome to call either myself or my colleague, Sue Jesper, on 
01 664 1111 or email Sue on sue@formations.ie [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001lDHCZlxrweQOyL6FUXazhHZUW5QHt_Hrt1HKP-ZLie5UCnB2Hz0ODYlESo9HF6tZhkdlUehRz8XVmfKYscxOXZTLJPRezoPE5R0spw3pqDigzwa2KbqI_1Oz1ghODo7JoTnDbUXj0wlMRXtNXRAdT8dX0H2CP2j1ctDbAW-0KW8=&c=_MInrxuw-Jk0pv1fZoHRrc7e0J5zNyrf7T-PvcNJwrAIHFeDJnEAbg==&ch=xhUY5pO-znqbDL-rEemYHe1F5EuihdZh0MRqk344onu56vZuwGToSQ==]and we'll give you all the help and advice you need.

Yours sincerely,

A brief summary of what is happening + a very useful Fact Sheet for you
With the introduction of the Companies Act 2014 on 1st June 2015, all existing private
companies limited by shares, have to decide whether they wish to be a DAC or opt
 in to being the new simplified LTD.

If no choice has been made by a company as of 30th November 2016, they will automatically
be converted to an LTD.  However, failure to take action prior to this date may 
result in a corporate form that is unsuitable for the business of your company, 
and indeed may be deemed as a breach of the Directors' duties.

In order to help you decide on the best option for your company, we have put together
a fact sheet on the conversion process, together with a snapshot of the main differences
between a DAC and an LTD.  We can also provide you with guidance and paperwork in
order to convert to your desired company type in advance of the deadlines.
Click here to view our Fact Sheet

With conversion packages to LTD from as little as ?189* + vat per company (*Discounts
for multiple companies are available)  it makes excellent economic sense for you
 to contact us to see how we can help with a cost effective and efficient solution
for all your conversion needs.

NOW
is perhaps the best time of all for you to attend to the necessary secretarial work
to convert your company.

If a company is making an application to be restored within twelve months of being
struck off or dissolved it can apply directly to the Companies Registration Office.
This will avoid the necessity of engaging a solicitor and barrister and seeking 
a hearing in the High Court.

Dear Steve,
Sue Jesper
It has now been over 12 months since
the commencement of The Companies Act 2014
,
and the formalisation of the process for strike off under statute.
An interesting addition to the legislation is the introduction of a process for
anyone
to object to a strike off on the basis that at least one of the necessary conditions hasn't been met.
Thus far the CRO have seen 25 objections filed from parties as diverse as creditors, the Revenue Commissioners, a company member (in a Company Limited by Guarantee), a former employee and a plaintiff in litigation against a company - and in the majority of these cases the objections have been sustained.
The last year has also seen 21 Companies submit forms to cancel their own strike off applications.
Of course, the above is just a drop in the ocean compared to the nearly 5,500 companies who have submitted a H15 form to apply for a strike off during the same period, with the
Voluntary Strike Off
process proving once again to be the method of choice for disposing of a company that is no longer required.
We have prepared an easy to follow Factsheet on the new procedure and it is available by simply clicking
HERE
.
With the 30th September Annual Return Date favoured by the vast majority of companies rapidly approaching,
NOW
would be a good time to review the companies under your administration to see if any should be struck off before this date.
If so, please contact
either
myself
or any of the team here at CFI
and we will be delighted to assist
.
Yours sincerely,
Sue Jesper
Company Secretarial Supervisor
