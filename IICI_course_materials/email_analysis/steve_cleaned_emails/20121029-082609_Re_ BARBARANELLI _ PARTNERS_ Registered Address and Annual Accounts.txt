Dear Alfredo Barbaranelli
 
 
Please note that following service has been expired for your company:
 
-          Registered Address 100 GBP
 
 
Please renew the service as soon as possible, otherwise will be not able to process your company’s annual returns and annual accounts.
 
 
Also note that Annual Accounts for your company are overdue since 31-08-2012.
 
 
Failure to file accounts or annual returns is a criminal offence which can result in directors being fined personally in the criminal courts. The registrar may also take steps to strike the company off the public record. Your company could receive a late filing penalty and as a director, you could incur a fine for the same set of accounts if you do not file them on time. Failure to pay a late filing penalty can result in enforcement proceedings.
 
 
To file overdue accounts please order our Extreme Accounting service for 500 GBP. You can order the service by clicking on the following link:

Please process the above mentioned orders for the required services in order to avoid penalties, company strike off and court proceedings.
