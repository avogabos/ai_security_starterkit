Dear Mr Smith

Thank you for your email of 28th February 2014 concerning the restoration of the above company.

There are two procedures for restoring companies to the register, which are:
            - An Administrative Restoration (solely for companies that are to remain on the register)
            - Order of Court to Restore the company to the register.

If you wish to Administratively restore the company to the register Companies House will require the following documents, -

1)  RT01 form, with a filing fee of £100.

2)  B.V. Waiver Letter (Information regarding this can be obtained from the Treasury Solicitors - https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/treasury-solicitor-s-department

3)  Annual Return forms for the years ending 28th November 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  We will require a £40 filing fee for the years 2009-2013 inclusive.

4)  Accounts for the periods ending 30th November 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

We will also require £1500 late filing penalty for the 2007 Accounts.

If you intend to restore the company by an Order of Court, you would need to follow the procedure outlined below.

An Application/ Claim Form CPR (Part 8) , and a witness statement stating details of who is making the claim, why the company was removed from the register and the purpose of the restoration would need to be served on the Court .

Information  regarding this can be found on the Treasury Solicitors website - ?http://www.tsol.gov.uk?  and ?http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk?

If there are no assets tied up in the company, you may prefer to incorporate a new company and, as long as the name is available, you may use the same name. This option is far cheaper, as there are only the incorporation fees payable.

Yours sincerely
Chi Yau
