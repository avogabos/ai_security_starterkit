Hi Karim
I will
update our dispatch department to send all 3 company certificate of
incorporation to your office address. Generally we send these via normal
registered post. However if you wish to receive these documents via courier,
there will be an additional charge for 65 GBP per document. Please confirm if we
can charge 65 GBP x 3 from your credit card.
Please
confirm if can charge 200 GBP x 3 for 3 power of attorneys.
Also
confirm if can charge 150 GBP x 3 for Apostille documents.
Total will
be 195 GBP (Courier Charges) + 600 GBP (power of attorney) + 450 GBP
(Apostille) = 1245 GBP. Please confirm and we will place the order and charge
your credit card.
Yes, you
can have Dr. Harmander Singh Gupta as director for all 3 companies. Please
confirm when we make the changes.
Waiting for
your confirmation for the above.
Regards,
Steve

Hi Karim and Tim
We will only send Hard Copy of Certificate of Incorporation. To
obtain other company documents and information on nominees, please login to
your account at our website and download documents such as:
-
Certificate
of Incorporation
-
Form
IN01
-
Company
Register
-
Share
Certificates
-
Memorandum
and Articles
Nominee Director can provide you with General Power of Attorney
at the costs of 200 GBP per company. Nominee Shareholder will only provide
signed share transfer form.
And as mentioned in our previous emails that Nominee Director or
shareholder will not involve in any company activities, so at the time of bank
account opening you will be required appoint your won director and shareholder.
Once bank account is opened you reverse the process.
And to open bank account with your own bank, these documents
will be enough, however bank might ask you for Apostille documents, which we
can arrange at the costs of 150 GBP per company.
Please note before applying for Apostille documents, please
change your director and shareholder by appointing your own.

Hi Steve:
We have
received confirmation that each of Argentum, Eventus and Oxbridge have been
formed.    Where do we get information on the nominee directors,
officers and shareholder.   Also when do we get copies of the
articles of association and memorandum.
I take it
that each nominee shareholder, officer and director will be giving a power of
attorney.   When will we be in receipt of such documents.
Which
address have they been sent to.    Finally, will these documents
suffice to open corporate accounts where we already have banking relationships
