TAX

 

Apple hit with €13bn tax bill

The European Commission has ruled that Apple should pay up to €13bn (£11bn) in back taxes because a deal with the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid. The ruling shocked the Irish political and business establishment, which had been expecting a much lower figure. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vesteger said: “This decision sends a clear message. Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not. This is not a penalty, this is unpaid taxes to be paid”. Ireland and Apple both said they disagreed with the penalty and would appeal against it, with Apple claiming the decision would be harmful for jobs. Chief executive Tim Cook also published an open letter claiming the decision “has no basis in fact.” Meanwhile, the US Treasury commented that such tax investigations were "unfair" and undermined the tax rules of individual states. And the White House warned that Brussels' decision could hamper efforts to create a fair international tax system. Meanwhile, Downing Street said it would "welcome" Apple to the UK following the verdict, and with chancellor Philip Hammond considering plans to cut corporation tax from 20% to 15% by 2020, Britain's corporation tax rate could soon be nearly as low as Ireland's.

Apple tax ruling: reaction

Commenting on the Apple tax ruling, the FT's Duncan Robinson says the case cuts to the heart of the power struggle between Brussels and Washington over who sets the standards for global business. Elsewhere, the Guardian’s Owen Jones says the ruling can be classed as a victory for protesters over tax avoidance and proves that grassroots campaigns can effect change. However, the paper’s Simon Bowers points out that the result will be a multibillion euro windfall for Ireland, an outcome he describes as “perverse” given Dublin’s role in facilitating the arrangement. The Mail’s Alex Brummer says the judgement represents a huge step towards a fairer global tax system, but the Telegraph’s Allister Heath says the saga demonstrates that corporation tax is an “outdated anachronism.” In the Times, Philip Aldrick says Apple's tax affairs are illustrative of how “hopelessly out-of-date” the current global tax system is, while Alastair Osborne says the US should shoulder some of the blame for the situation because of its uncompetitive corporation tax rate.

Society suggests scrapping allowances

The Fabian Society has suggested that personal tax allowances are scrapped and the money used to pay a flat-rate benefit to all adults. The concept is part of a proposed shake-up of the welfare system, which the Society says is required to stop tens of thousands of people falling into poverty over the next decade. The report's authors reject the idea of a "fully-fledged" universal basic income, but argue that a flat-rate "individual credit" payment for all adults that sat alongside the existing benefits system could "significantly reduce poverty and increase low and middle incomes". The Society imagines that credits would be paid on a flat-rate basis either through PAYE or in cash and could represent a "modest basic income" of around £40 a week per person.

BBA welcomes call to repeal bank tax

The British Bankers’ Association has welcomed a call by the CBI to scrap the 8% surcharge imposed on bank profits by former Chancellor George Osborne. Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the CBI, said the special bank tax should be dropped and banks taken "off the naughty step" as the City tries to fend off challenges to its position as the financial capital of Europe.

Figures from HMRC reveal the number of Europeans with a 'live' tax record in Britain is 2.54m. The figure suggests up to 800,000 more EU nationals have been working in Britain than claimed in official job figures.

PENSIONS

 

£500 pension allowance to help plan retirement

Government proposals would allow savers planning their retirement to take up to £500 tax free from their pension pots to put towards the cost of financial advice. The pensions advice allowance, due to come into force in April, comes after concerns that people without significant wealth face an "advice gap".

£250m of start-up loans handed out

Funded through the British Business Bank, Start Up Loans generate a return on investment to the economy of £3 for every £1 spent, said Mr Clark. London entrepreneurs have received more than £66m through the funding programme, with Hackney enjoying the largest value of start-up support.

Mortgage approvals at 18-month low, says Bank of England

The number of mortgages being approved by banks and building societies is at its lowest for a year and a half, according to Bank of England figures. During July, 60,912 new mortgages were approved, down from 64,152 approvals in June, and the lowest total since January 2015. The total amount lent out for house purchases was £10.4bn, down from £11.1bn in June, and the figures also show a 12.4% drop in the number of mortgage approvals on the same month a year ago. Meanwhile, consumer credit increased by £1.2bn in July, compared with an average of £1.6bn over the previous six months. Credit card lending grew at a slower rate in July of £479m, down from £579m in June. Other types of loans, including personal loans and overdrafts, increased by £702m, reining back sharply from a £1.3bn increase in June.

Consumer confidence rises in August 

GfK's latest confidence barometer shows a recovery in consumer intentions to spend on large items. All five measures used to calculate the index, including confidence about personal finances and the broader economy, rose in August with the headline index up five points to -7. This remains below the 12-month average of -1 and well below the reading of 7 recorded in August 2015.
