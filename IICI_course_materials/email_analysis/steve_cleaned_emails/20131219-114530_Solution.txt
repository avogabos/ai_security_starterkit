Steve,

I just spoke with my bank and they said that the payments are not going
through because of the new RBI regulation. The new regulation says that no
international transaction can be done over 50,000 INR. And even if we are
trying 495 GBP, it's not going through as the bank inter-exchange rate is
102 INR/GBP hence 495 GBP is also over 50,000 INR.

They said ask Formation House to Break down the order of 545 pounds into
two parts and both payment shall go through without any hassle.

Can you please remove all orders from the dashboard and create 2 orders
like one of 345 GBP and another of 200 GBP? or 400 GBP and 145 GBP?

We will be able to complete the procedure during UK evening time today in
that case.

Please let me know the feasibility.

Regards,
Pratik Roy
