Dear Paul

 

Cost of preparing Apostille set of company documents for Diplomatic Protection Service will be as following:

 

-          Apostille Documents (processing time 15 working days) : GBP 150

-          Apostille Documents EXPRESS (processing time 7 working days) : GBP 300

 

The following documents are Apostilled for a UK Limited Company: 

 

*	Certificate of Incorporation 
*	Articles of Association 
*	Memorandum of Association 
*	Form IN01

 

Check with your bank if they also require Certificate of Good Standing, it can also be included in Apostille set of company documents. The cost for processing the certificate is:

 

-          Certificate of Good Standing (processing time 15 working days) : GBP 50

-          Certificate of Good Standing EXPRESS (processing time 7 working days) : GBP 120

 

Please note that processing time increase if you need certificate of good standing to be included in Apostille because first we will process certificate of good standing and then we will process Apostille.

 

For delivery of above documents we advice to use courier service which will cost GBP 65 (within Europe) and GBP 75 (outside of Europe). Otherwise we will send it via general postal service.

 

To order above services please follow the following steps:

 

1. Login to your account at our website www.formationshouse.com using MY ACCOUNT link and provide your Customer ID and Password.

Dear Steve, 

 

thank you for Your email and efforts to resolve the matter and I appreciate the gesture. 

 

I just hope that everything works out in the tamest time.

 

I should have  one request, it is possible to please send apostiled document for my company Diplomatic Protection Service ( in the annex) , 

the bank does not want to open an company account  without this apostille – exactly this one via enclosure  . How long would it take to arrange this apostiled document? It's urgent. 

 

Thank you again 

 

Paul

HI Pavel,

 

We have just spoken with Companies House, Annual Accounts which we sent to Companies House last Friday should have reached Companies House on Monday but due to known reasons it is still in transit with the postal service.

 

Unfortunately we are bound to send these documents by post and now we have to wait until Annual Accounts are delivered which we are hopeful should be done in 2-3 working days. We will contact Companies House again on Monday for an update

 

I highly appreciate your patience in this regard and honestly in my 15 years of experience this is first time I am facing such a delay.
