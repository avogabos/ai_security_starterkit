Dear Sarah,

 

Further to the subject application.

 

Please be advised that in order to finalize the account opening process,
amended Membership Certificate for Liberum LLC is needed. The Membership
certificate currently does not state the following:

 

1.      Percentage of Membership interest

2.      Signature of the manager

3.      Date in accordance with incorporation date of the company
(certificate is dated 07/06/2012 but the company was formed 19/6/2012)

 

Please arrange for the certificate to be amended and please provide its
certified true copy via e-mail and with hard copy to follow in due course.

 

We are looking forward to receiving the document and to finalizing the
account opening process.

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Kind Regards,
