Dear Mr. Steve Smith,

Please find below my answers with \u201cA\u201d.

Thank you for your email.

We can certainly assist you in registering trust, foundation and 
offshore IBC.
A: Great.

We can arrange registration of Trust and Foundation in The Republic of 
Gambia. The cost will be:
- Gambia Trust Registration 750 GBP
- Gambia Foundation Registration 750 GBP
A: We can have the Foundation in Gambia - charitable reason. This 
Foundation will be 100 % shareholder into other 127 ones in order to 
manage the entire structure from 1 single point. Each of those 127 
Foundations will be incorporated by skilled lawyers. Through these 
Foundations we\u2019ll have social projects all across the World, including 
in Africa (Gambia too). Can you give me more details and which are the 
next steps? What other services can be attached for the Foundation?

A: The Trusts jurisdictions must be: Spain, Belgium, Brazil, US, South 
Africa, Canada, France, Italy, UAE, Netherland, UK, Germany, Poland and 
Seychelles - 14 units. The Seychelles one will be used for personal 
wealth protection and the other 13 as investment shields.

A: We\u2019re interested to have as Trustees a bank/banks which will execute 
our investment interests and act as a shield. The bank/banks will not 
need to loan us money for the future investments, they will act just as 
payment platform, since the amounts will be wired from abroad into those 
banks.

We can arrange Offshore IBC registration in following jurisdictions:
- Seychelles 340 GBP
- BVI 590 GBP
- Belize 390 GBP
- Gambia 195 GBP
A: Would be possible to have your support also for other jurisdictions, 
such as: Panama, Honk Kong, Mauritius, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, 
Nevada (US), Malta, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Marshall Islands? We\u2019re 
interested to have the Greenliife name into each offshore company. Can 
you give me more details and which are the next steps? What other 
services can be attached here? A part of them I already express it into 
my previous e-mail.

We can arrange virtual office in following jurisdictions:
- United Kingdom
- Switzerland
- New York - USA
- Hong Kong
A: Would be possible to have your support also for the attached 
jurisdictions? For the ready-made companies can we exchange the name? 
Can we attach also other services?

If you require further information or assistance you can contact me at 
info@formationshouse.com or steve@formationshouse.com or 
0044-(0)207-016-2727 Monday to Friday 12pm to 7pm GMT.
A: For the moment I\u2019ll prefer the e-mail channel.

Green regards,
