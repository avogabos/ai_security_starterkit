Wow! Do you know why?

That can cost millions of dollars delaying the launch of a very large

Good to see you yesterday.
Further to our chat about Direct Plus Ltd in order to file dormant
company accounts I need the Companies House authentication code.
If you don’t have this the option is to either for you to request
the information from Companies House or just to go straight into the process of
having the company struck off.
I really don’t feel that it is important but the decision is yours.
