INDUSTRY

Independence would hit financial industry
Writing in the FT, Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, says a Yes vote in the Scottish Independence referendum would have a significant impact on the financial services industry, which he notes is the UK's "biggest taxpayer, its largest export earner" and the area that attracts "more foreign direct investment than any other sector." He warns that foreign investors are likely to be more cautious in the event of independence, and states the 177,000 people in Scotland who work in the financial and related professional services sector must be made aware of what is at stake. The financial industry helps the UK pay its way in the world. He concludes: "Last year the sector ran an impressive £55bn trade surplus, more than all other exporting sectors combined... it will take much time and effort to regain what will immediately be lost, and the resulting productivity dip is obvious but uncosted." Meanwhile, the CIOT has suggested that some of the 8,500 people employed by HMRC in Scotland could find their jobs under threat in an independent country, with Patrick Stevens warning: "It seems likely that HMRC would gradually remove their posts from Scotland as it would have become a foreign country."

Legal revisions present opportunity for accountants
Chartered accountants are set to be licensed to offer probate services, as the government and the Law Society considers which reserved legal activities should be deregulated. A statutory instrument issued in parliament in August allows chartered accountants to undertake probate in non-contentious cases subject to the passing of the necessary exams and being properly licensed. Elsewhere, the Solicitors Regulation Authority is planning to propose reforms to the separate business rule - which could include removing it altogether, which would give law firms the chance to bring non-lawyer professionals in as partners without becoming an alternative business structure.

Companies buying back shares
The Economist examines the growing trend for companies to buy back their own shares. Over the past year, American firms have bought back more than $500bn of their own shares, close to a record amount. It is noted that IBM spends twice as much on share repurchases as on R&D, while Exxon has spent over $200bn buying back its shares. The Economist argues that buybacks could become a source of trouble. Firstly, because both short-term investors and managers have incentives to overdo buy-backs and neglect long-term investment projects. Secondly, some firms may be borrowing too much to pay for their buyback habit.

Accountants cleared
Two accountants charged in connection with an alleged £1m Gift Aid fraud have been cleared after new evidence came to light. Edward Watkin Gittins, a fellow of the ICAEW, and Martin Calcutt, a member of the ICAEW, were charged last year with cheating the public revenue, but a spokesman for the CPS said that a judge at Liverpool Crown Court directed that the pair should be acquitted after prosecutors decided the case against them should be dropped.

IT consultancy insolvencies rise
The latest Exaro Insolvency Index shows insolvencies amongst consultancies in the IT sector have risen dramatically in the third quarter. Some 203 IT consultancies have filed for insolvency in Q3 so far, an increase of 36.2% on the same period in 2013.

TAX

Banks' tax bills to soar
Banks operating in the UK face extra tax payments worth hundreds of millions of pounds under rules enforced by the European Court of Justice. The ECJ dictated that VAT must be charged on services provided to companies by their overseas offices. The ruling means that many financial services companies in London are likely to be faced with substantially-higher tax bills. Previously, services such as IT and call centre operations provided to a bank from a foreign office were not charged the 20% tax, as they were deemed to be within the same "VAT group". However, the ECJ, in a case related to the Swedish insurer Skandia, said these services should be subject to VAT. "What this ruling does is, at a stroke, add hundreds of millions of pounds to the annual cost of financial institutions doing business in the UK and other EU member states," said Richard Iferenta, head of financial services indirect tax at KPMG.

Property tax reforms needed
In a letter to the Evening Standard, Dr David Lutton, the director of policy at London First argues that the property tax system needs reforming. He cites recent figures showing that a rising number of Londoners are getting dragged into the death tax brackets as an argument for change. He also says there is a good case for the introduction of new bands at the top of the council tax structure to improve equality, however he warns that what must not be considered is the introduction of a mansion tax, which he believes would effectively be a tax on London.
Evening Standard, Page: 39

Osborne under pressure over patent tax breaks
George Osborne is expected to face opposition to his "patent box tax break" scheme when G20 finance ministers meet in Australia at the Weekend. The scheme, which came into effect in April last year, is designed to attract and nurture R&D companies in the UK. UK-based companies are entitled to a lower tax rate on profits from work related to patents that qualify for the scheme. However, negotiators involved in the programme of international tax reform being drafted by the OECD have judged the scheme to be so poorly targeted, and damaging to foreign treasury coffers, as to be classed as "harmful tax competition".
The Guardian (Web)

Corporate crackdown a good start
An FT editorial welcomes the OECD's publishing of sweeping rules to crack down on the problem of corporate tax avoidance, including measures to increase transparency, close loopholes and limit the use of tax havens. It also warns there is much hard work ahead however. "For too long the highly technical topic of corporate tax avoidance has been driven by populist outrage. Public embarrassment may be a powerful weapon... but it is also a crude instrument. If governments fail to build on the OECD's manifesto, policy can only get clumsier," it concludes.
Financial Times, Page: 12<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ecfc6c6c-3e50-11e4-a620-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3DbipFVaR>

Obesity tacklers should get tax breaks
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, says businesses should be given tax breaks for encouraging their employees to fight obesity. The condition costs the NHS billions of pounds a year, and Mr Stevens believes incentives are needed for firms to offer weight loss programmes, cycle schemes and other efforts to keep people healthy at work. "If as a nation we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline, we'll be piling on the pounds in terms of future taxes needed just to keep the NHS afloat," he stated.
The Times, Page: 2   The Daily Telegraph, Page: 6

Raise IHT, says Glover
Stephen Glover calls on George Osborne to revive his plans to raise the limit at which IHT is paid to £1m. He suggests that the policy would be a likely vote winner, as the threshold at which tax becomes payable at 40% has actually fallen below its 2007 level, when the Chancellor first proposed reforming the tax. However, he also notes that "for the very rich, inheritance tax is essentially voluntary," citing purchases and trust funds that can be arranged to minimise liabilities.

Jobs secured at Phones 4u
Dixons Carphone says it has secured an agreement to offer positions to 800 staff working in the 160 Phones 4u concessions in its stores following the retailer's collapse. However, a further 4,200 jobs remain at risk after the company fell into administration. Phones 4u blamed its rapid decline on EE's decision not to renew its contract, following a similar move by Vodafone earlier in September. The Times reports that a large group of senior bondholders have approached PwC, the administrator, with a plan to carry out a debt-for-equity swap that they claim could allow Phones 4u to continue. Louise Verrill of Brown Rudnick, the law firm advising the bondholders, said that they "would take a significant writedown on their debt, which would make the business commercially viable and lay foundations for the 5,596 jobs to be saved".

Irish High Court Judge Bronagh O'Hanlon has, for the first time ever, approved an order to allow a liquidator to serve a person connected with a liquidated firm with papers through the social media site LinkedIn. She permitted PKF O'Connor, Leddy and Holmes to serve papers on a person connected with the Irish Education and Research Institute. The school closed suddenly in May and the accountancy firm was unable to contact the relevant person by email, fax or postal address.

Export support for SMEs

He says recent data showing that less than one in five UK medium-sized businesses export outside the EU is "humbling". "Our export promotion body, UKEF, is widening its scheme to provide loans to overseas buyers of goods produced by UK traders. At Standard Chartered, we hold workshops for UK SMEs interested in exporting to emerging markets," he states.

ECONOMY

Unemployment drops to 2008 levels
The ONS reports that the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% in the three months to the end of July, its lowest level since the bank bailouts of October 2008. The number of people out of work declined 146,000 to 2.02m, with the number of claimants for Jobseeker's Allowance falling below 1m in August. However, wages continue to lag the current 1.5% rate of inflation, with pay including bonuses up 0.6% on an annual basis. Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said "The squeeze on households' purchasing power has eased modestly although it remains appreciable".

Murdoch considers Scottish move
The Independent claims that Rupert Murdoch will consider moving the domicile of his newspaper company News Corporation from the US to an independent Scotland. The prospect of a low corporation tax rate, being able to get away from US scrutiny over the hacking scandal, and a return to the Murdoch family's roots are all said to appeal.
