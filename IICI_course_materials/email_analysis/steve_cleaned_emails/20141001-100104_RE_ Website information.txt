Dear Chris,

 

The profit of the company is based on your income minus all costs. We suggest you include all possible costs to the company when compiling accounts.

 

Whatever profit is then left is attributed to the partners of the company, and taxed as per the partners status. The partners in your case are Seychelles IBC. Now it’s important to understand that the tax status of an IBC is where the directors reside, and no tax is levied in Seychelles itself.

 

Your accountant friend is technically correct, and you should be declaring in the partnership returns any profits received in the UK. 

You as the company owners must decide whether the companies profits have been derived from direct business in the UK or whether they have been derived elsewhere.

 

When each Seychelles partner receives its share of the profits (if you decide to disperse them – as you don’t have to) then the director must then be responsible for deciding where to declare these profit incomes. 

 

The confusion here is in separating the profit of the LLP and the profit dispersed to the partners.

 

Taxation

LLPs are ‘tax transparent’ which means that each member, not the partnership, will be assessed to tax on their share of the LLP’s income or gains. Any non-UK source profits or gains made by an LLP will not be subject to UK tax unless the members are UK resident individuals or companies.

There are no restrictions on the residence or nationality of the members of an LLP and therefore, if the members of the LLP are non-resident and the income of the LLP is non-UK source, the LLP will not be subject to UK taxation. It is therefore possible to have an LLP set up in such a way as to not be liable to any UK taxation.

There is an obligation for an LLP to file an annual partnership tax return whether the partners are taxed or not. 




If you need any further information on accounting practises for LLP’s please speak with our accountants as they are more knowledgeable.

 

Kind Regards

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte

 

OK thanks for the clarification.

 

I was speaking to an accountant friend of mine about the LLP and her said that 

 

'LLP profits would ordinarily be taxed in the UK when the partnership profits are earned if they are earned in the UK. The mere fact that they may not have been or were not going to be declared doesn't mean they are not taxable.'


​How did you propose on minimising this profit and hence the tax liability.

 

Thanks

Chris

Dear Chris,

 

The company is indeed incorporated. The issues are CH has changed the LLP filing system, meaning we aren’t currently integrated as we were before, but it is being updated.

The surest way to check is to go to www.companieshouse.gov.uk and check here for the company.

 

Many Thanks

 

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte/Steve

 

When I logon to your website and look under LLP management I get this screen.

 



 

Can you please confirm that the LLP is incorporated and that your system needs updating.

 

Thanks
