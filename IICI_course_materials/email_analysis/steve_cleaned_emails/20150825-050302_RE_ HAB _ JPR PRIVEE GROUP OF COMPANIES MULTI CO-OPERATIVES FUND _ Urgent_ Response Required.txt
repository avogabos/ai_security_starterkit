HI,
We have received a general letter via DHL for company HAB & JPR PRIVEE GROUP OF COMPANIES MULTI CO-OPERATIVES FUND at London office address.
Since this company is not using our Virtual Office services we are required to return this letter back to the sender, or you can upgrade to our Virtual Office services to receive the letter.
Please advice.
Regards
Steve
