 Good morning Steve 
 
 Please find attached a copy of
 my passport and a utility bill showing my address and name.
 
 
 I called your office last
 week to check what I needed and this was all that was asked
 for. It did say in your e mail 3 months of utility bills etc
 but the person I spoke to said it was a bill that was not
 older that 3 months you wanted.
 
 Any questions please call
