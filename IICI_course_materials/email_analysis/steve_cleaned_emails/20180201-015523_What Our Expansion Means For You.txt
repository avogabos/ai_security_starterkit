New Centres and Co-working Opportunities

One of our goals for the year ahead is to continue to grow our centre network through demand-driven development. This means we go where you need us. We've opened new centres in Chengdu (https://www.executivecentre.com/centre-page/chengdu_pingan_international_finance_centre/?mc_cid=1c89e524ae&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) and Tokyo (https://www.executivecentre.com/centre-page/jingumae-tower-building/?mc_cid=1c89e524ae&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . In the second half of the quarter we will be expanding in Hong Kong, Beijing and Dubai.

Like many of our other centres, these locations boast incredible co-working facilities and we would encourage you to take full advantage of this the next time you travel.

All the best for the rest of your week,
The Executive Centre
