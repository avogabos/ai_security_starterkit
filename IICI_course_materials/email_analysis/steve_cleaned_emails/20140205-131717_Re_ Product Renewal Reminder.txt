Hi Steve

I understand what the renewal is for.

However your company was meant to create a UK bank account for us last
year. It is still not open.

As a result we cannot make use of the offshore companies.

If I had known it would take a year to set up the bank account then we
would have created the offshore companies later and saving ourselves 1 year
of registration.

I was therefore asking if, in a gesture of goodwill you would pay for this
registration for us.

Regards
Chris

Re: Product Renewal Reminder
Hi Steve
I noticed there is a charge of £400 per company for this
renewal.
Considering that we have not been able to make use of these
companies due to the UK bank account still not being opened I presume your
company will not charge us for this renewal.
Can you confirm this.
Regards
Chris

Hi
Chris
The
renewals are for your Offshore Company’s in Seychelles.
For
Seychelles companies, you are not required to do annual filing, you only need
to renew the company registration.
You
can place the order online from your account.
