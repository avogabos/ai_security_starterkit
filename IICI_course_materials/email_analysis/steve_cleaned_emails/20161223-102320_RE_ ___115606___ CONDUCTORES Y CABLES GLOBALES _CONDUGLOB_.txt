Hi Wade, 

 

I thought we sent all the corporate documents previously and now the client is not happy. So sorry if I did miss this. 

 

Please see attached for your perusal. 

 

I am now away until the 28th December 2016

 

Have a Merry Christmas! 

 

Kind regards

Nadya

Hi Nadya

 

Unfortunately compliance will require more specific information in the partner form, about the partner and the relationship - a few sentences please, also can the client provide a agreement?

 

Thank you
