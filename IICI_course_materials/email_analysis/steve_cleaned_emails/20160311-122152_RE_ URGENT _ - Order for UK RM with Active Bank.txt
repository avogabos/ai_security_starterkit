Hi,

 

Thank you. almost there. 2 more points

 

-          Can we provide credit report before client purchase companies?

 

-          Also Oliver said that we can provide bank statement to client,
hiding the bank account number. client would like to see that, please
arrange as soon as possible.

 

 

Thank you

They are law firm, can become a very good reseller...Their query is:

 

 

 

We choose 2 ready made with bank account, can you give us your best price
for the order of two ready-made. Thank you in advance.

ONCABLE LTD
Year established: 12/11/2009
Barclays Bank Account
9500 GBP (our demand)


MATRIX DIGITAL LTD
Year established: 03/03/2010
Barclays Bank Account
8500 GBP (our demand)



Can you give us more informationon liabilities and assets of each company? I
will get the credit report if needed
If the account work?

What are the steps to take for remote redemption? Can we keep a bank account
at Barclays? They must come here to take the account with proof of id and
address, which should be in English or notarized translation

The directors will be non-UK resident but resident in Europe. Not usually a
problem

Canyou tell me if the annual domiciliation with mail forwarding is included
in the purchase ready-made package, what services are included in this
price? No, regstaered address is included for 1 yrs an the annual return
done at transfer, the VO is not but we can discount to 450 each

Because we have other offers and want to work with the best offer, and the
most professional company. This is our First order if everything is ok, we
will order the following, and we will work together throughout the year.
