Dr. Mr.
now she was very clear.
Forgive me if I ask another clarification:


1) UK ltd for anonymous it is accepted that a person does everything, both the administrator and the director is the owner of the shares then being bearer gives them to me.
And this person is still in office sensation resign (as I have suggested in other estimates).
2) With regard to the current account management, I can send my passport, or come in person, (my brother lives in London and Paris, yesterday was of london)
but because I can not open an account at HSBC (tower)?


Regarding the offshore fact, she tells me that the director / amministartore / shareholder then gives the charge, that's why I do not understand this point.


Then I asked her again the uk should have an agency contract from offshore, as provided for in uk then pay the 5% tax in uk and will be able to transfer 95% of the profits on offshore, in this regard the contract prepares him or her is prepared from its corresponding of seychelles?


thanks again
