Hi Steve

 

Thanks for your information earlier.   

 

To confirm - conference room is £25 per hr plus VAT 

Nameplate on door  no extra charge

Refreshments can also be arranged for the day

 

Please send photos of the rooms and reception area as kindly suggested.
Can you also confirm how much notice we must give prior to booking rooms?

And can you also confirm if you have an office next door or on the same
floor as the conference rooms?  If so how much would it cost to hire per
hour?

 

Thank you.  We look forward to hearing from you

 

Regards

Lorna
