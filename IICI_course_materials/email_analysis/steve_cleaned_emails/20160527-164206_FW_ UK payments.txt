Please forward to the relevant team members. thanks

 

Dear Team,

 

Following our success in getting contracts in Gabon and Cameroon, we need to
ensure we raise enough investment to support the projects, and of course
repay you all for your hard work and for your loyalty to our company.

 

In the UK, several large firms have expressed interest in funding us however
they are uncomfortable with the way in which we have paid for the
development of our IP to date.

Because we use a number of companies it makes it all rather unclear, so they
have asked us to show that we are paying out staff directly and that the
work they are doing is for our company and not another and therefore we own
the IP.

 

From this month, all salaries will be paid directly from the UK to your bank
accounts.

I am aware this may cause long term issues for some, so please be assured
this is a short term thing of maybe just a few months while we then setup a
subcompany of the uk one in Karachi for the benefit of clarity for the
investors.

 

Once the investment funds are secured we will ensure bonuses and reviews are
carried out where needed

 

Many Thanks

 

Charlotte & Darius
