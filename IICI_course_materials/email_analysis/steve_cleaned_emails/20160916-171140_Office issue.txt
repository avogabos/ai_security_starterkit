Charlotte,

 

We are facing some issues that need your attention. Please check the chat
below. The sales and support team would like to confirm the issues. Please
note that our office is in an area where you can get everything and these
days everything is a phone call away. We understand that it was a sudden
move and that the management has done a good job but the holidays are over
and by looking at the chat below it seems that he does not have a genuine
reason to give us sub standard water. Please look into it.
