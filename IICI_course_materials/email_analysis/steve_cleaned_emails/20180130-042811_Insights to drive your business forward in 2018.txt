Planning For Productivity

Work for the year has begun in earnest and we wanted to share some timely updates, advice and news.

We’re reflecting on 2017 and sharing important projections for the new year - community building and network expansion will be focal points for 2018.

All in all, we look forward to sharing more of these updates with you. We’ll also be providing more details about member events and opportunities for you to experience our global network online and offline.
