Hello,

Merry Christmas!

I've looked at the list of services, as suggested, but I could not find a
description. For example what is the list of documents that will be
apostilled in the "Apostille" and "Apostille Express" products? Do they
include a Certificate of Incumbency and Certificate of Good Standing, or
equivalent current documents required for the opening of a company bank
account? If these are ordered separately, will they be apostilled?

Regards,
Dinko Georgiev
