Hi Steve,

Hi
            Alex
Yes
it
            is correct you need to select
Annual Accountancy Service \u2013 GBP 300. You
            can pay by corporate
            card. Please note in order to pay by credit or debit card
            you need to have a 3D
            Secure code to authenticate the payment. Please collect this
            information from
            your card service provider.
Nominee
Director
            service is only available at the time of company formation
            and also
            nominee director will not involve in any company and will
            not provide any
            documents.

Re: FW: annual accounting for Staince
                Investments
Hi Steve,
We have paid for our address but for accounting service we
            have the only option
            named Annual Accountancy Service, not Value Accounting. Is
            that correct option?
            And I have another question - can we pay with our corporate
            debit card
            (Maestro)?
There is one more problem appeared lately. We have been
            requested to present a
            director resided in EU to be able to process credit cards
            for our services. We
            need to provide a proof of residence for a person who is
            listed as a director.
            So I would like to know do you provide nominee director
            services and how much
            does it cost, considering that nominee director will not be
            bothered at all
            besides requesting a proof of residence time to time.
Thanks in advance for answers.
Best regards,
Alex

Steve,
I understand about the prices (we're not overdue yet but
              close to that) but I
              asked about our account ID :) We have several accounts in
              your service and I am
              not sure which account we should use for ordering. I know
              about account IDs
              4134665, 30138628 and there are probably more. Which one
              of these is our proper
              account?
Thank you for help,

To
                process company\u2019s Annual Accounts and Tax Returns you
                need
                Value Accounting service for GBP 300. However if filing
                is overdue then you
                need to choose Extreme Accounting GBP 500.
If
                you also need assistance with filing VAT Returns then
                you
                will need Value Accounting GBP 300 and OutSource

Hi Steve,
Thank you very much for the reply. I am not sure about
                our account as we have 3
                or 4 accounts with you - we got new one every time of
                annual accounting for
                several years. So I am not sure which one is correct for
                now. Could you please
                tell me which account should we use for ordering? We
                will try to order Value
                Accounting and registered address renewal, I will ask
                for help if we get issues

Hi Alex
Thank you for your email.
We can certainly assist you in
                filing the annual returns.
For filing accounts you can place
                the order for Value
                Accounting GBP 300 using the Accounting Services section
                in your account at our
                website, make payment and then send us your transactions
                for processing. If you
                face any problem let me know and I will place the order
                for you.
Also note that you need to renew
                the registered address
                for GBP 100 ASAP.
Regards
Steve

Hi Oliver,
We have just chat with you. Our company is Staince Investments, Ltd. and
we'd like to use your service for annual accounting again. I need a bit
of help with a payment for your services (we used your service several
times and every time there is something new :)) and a template for an
accounting data - we usually send out our transactions list using your
templates and the rest is done by your company, including reports to
Companies House. I would be happy if we could do the same this time.
Thank you for care,
