Dear All Staff,

 

I hope you all had some much needed family time yesterday.

 

I am aware following Darius's email last week there are some concerns
regarding the presence of Mr Ayub Khan in Karachi at the moment

He is there visiting his mother, our grandmother, who has become sick due to
the strain A Khan and Tahir has created in their attempt to take control of
Formations House and sell it to a competitor.

 

There is a chance Mr Ayub will attempt to contact some of you to find out
more about the current business.

 

Please do not be concerned. The operation of Formations House has never been
owned by AK or Tahir, and the role of your previous employer InfiniLogic was
as an outsourced service provider.

 

The owner of InfiniLogic Mr Raheem, cause many financial issues after my
father passing as he used the company to misappropriate funds and attempt to
then sell Formations House with AK and Tahir. Due to the misappropriation of
funds, you all experienced issues in being paid. Officially InfiniLogic
actually owes you 2-3 months of salary as those salaries were eventually
paid directly from my company and not InfiniLogic.

 

Your new employment under Knowledge Path means you have no allegiance to the
previous company or Mr Khan.

 

I cannot ask anyone to not peak with Mr Khan, but I do ask out of respect to
please do not speak about the current business and our other projects.

The projects Darius and I are working on are not directly related to
Formations House but give all of you a role in the future success of the
business. These projects were signed and sealed after my father sadly passed
away and I would prefer Mr Khan was not informed of these

 

If Mr Khan approaches you, you should feel no concern as you have no
obligations to him

 

He may ask for some assistance with the administration of his company.
Please in that case take the information and send me the information for
approval before processing.

 

If anyone has any concerns please do email me or Darius

 

Kindest Regards

 

Charlotte
