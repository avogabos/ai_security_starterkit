Hi Steve,
My mistake my client would like a nominee director but will have a
shareholder with a company representative (EU resident).
To open the bank account and have the VAT registration presume that we
would have to select the management service ( silver or gold).
If we take Silver option all the costs we discussed (except buying the
ready made company) are included upfront and cover one year of service.
Please confirm.

If we agree to proceed and select one ready made company I presume that you
will need to obtain the details of the shareholder and its company
representative who is based in the EU.

Thanks
John

Steve,
thanks a lot for these details.
Actually we will have one director and a shareholder
 so no nominee service at the end.
The company will not be trading so I kept only VAT
registration and bank account  which are useful. For the bank account is
it possible to propose a
bank that the future owner would prefer i.e HSBC ?

will be the signatory for bank account and will manage company's bank account
on your behalf.
