Dear Steve,

Good Evening. Many thanks for your interest in our services.

A brief introduction to the firm. Our firm seeks to offer business advice and legal representation in all aspects of corporate, commercial and financial-legal services. One of our main strengths is our corporate and tax planning department. Furthermore, our main strength lies in the fact that our members share a common ‘can-do spirit’ and approach client matters with a positive problem-solving approach that adds value to our clients' projects.

I myself am one of the partners in charge of tax, specifically Accounting, Corporate Taxation & Direct and Indirect Tax Planning (Profile<http://www.ccmalta.com/the-firm/management_team/kac>). By way of introduction to our firm, I invite you to visit our Firm Profile<http://www.ccmalta.com/publications/cc_firm_profile>.

Furthermore in relation to company formation, please find in attachment our factsheet denoting the salient points on Malta companies. Please do feel free to look into this and revert with any clarification you may have.

In the meantime, following is a summary of our fees:

Start-up (one-time costs):
Company Formation: € 855
Official Registry Fee: € 245
Bank Accounts: € 250

Capital (in your company bank account): Minimum € 1,250 (20% paid up)

Annual Costs:
Domiciliation: € 700
Annual Registry Fee: € 100
Accounting, VAT Compliance, Tax Returns: €500 (for up to 8 hours of work)

Optional:
Fiduciary Shareholding per UBO: € 650
Company Secretary: € 500
Local Company Directors: available on request.
Additional HoldCo: Domiciliation / Registry Fee: € 800 + 100

Time frame
In relation to the timescales, as soon as we receive payment we will start preparing the incorporation documents and will guide you as to the due diligence documentation which would be required. From our end within approximately 3 working days we will prepare the documents. We will send the documents for your signature and as soon as we receive the signed originals as well as the original due diligence documents in original, we can register the company with approximately 2 working days. Following that, once the company is incorporated we will send the application forms to the bank. In relation to the duration for the bank account opening, this is highly dependent on the bank and varies on a case by case basis.

Nonetheless we would strongly suggest contacting us with a detailed scenario, so that we would be in a better position to guide you and prepare a tailor-made proposal accordingly.

I hope the above is of help, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks
Best regards, Kenneth
