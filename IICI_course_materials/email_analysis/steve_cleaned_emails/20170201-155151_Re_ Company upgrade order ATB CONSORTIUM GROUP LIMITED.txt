Steve, unfortunately there are difficltues.
Please help me.

1. I filed Confirmation Statement - there is still no any information at
companies house that it was filed.

2. Instead of this there is note that reg address was changed to
Registered office address Suite B, 29 Harley Street (#Expired#), London,
England, W1G 9QR

I did not do anything with reg address at 27th of January. I just renewed
it now.

Have no idea why it happened.


Please check about Confirmation statement. Maybe problem in payment?

We had enough money at our deposit. Please check it.


And please change address to normal Harley Street...


:(((
