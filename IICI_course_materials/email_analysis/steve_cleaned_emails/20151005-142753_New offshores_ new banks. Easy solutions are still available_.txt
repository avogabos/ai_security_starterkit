** New offshores, new banks. Easy solution are still available!
------------------------------------------------------------

It is by far a tempting decision to use a tax haven company for international business: without accounting burden, without taxes, without complex registration process. If you still would like to work with a simple offshore company, it may be a good idea to turn to a fresh jurisdiction, which would not be that notorious or over-used. Dominica IBC (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=6cb838a483&e=267b4f0486) is inexpensive and easy suggestion. Shelf companies are available momentarily at US$ 1190 (while next year fee is only US$ 800). Nominee set (Director/ Shareholder / Apostilled Power of Attorney) goes for US$ 490 per year.

------------------------------------------------------------
As more and more banks make it unbelievably hard and long to get through their compliance, and other banks simply do not open accounts for offshores, there are still reliable banks that welcome new clients. Some fresh alternatives are available with our help at EU banks:

Meridian Trade Bank AS (Latvia) ) – quick remote account opening for €500 + €250 bank commission.Apply now. (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=68dbe1522c&e=267b4f0486)
Československá obchodní banka, a.s. (ČSOB) (Czech Republic)– quick remote account opening for €1800 including bank commission. Apply now. (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=4d7195eea5&e=267b4f0486)

For those who consider banks outside the EU, we offer account opening services at Caribbean banks, which couple greatly with Dominica IBCs (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=d57006fe74&e=267b4f0486) . Our fee is US$ 1000. Apply now. (http://darwintax.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e90c5dc7917ea0a33feac0e6b&id=a4f267e077&e=267b4f0486)

! Our hint! As offshore bank account opening is often a challenging and long procedure. Thus, a good idea might be opening a quick account at one of the above EU banks for a quick start of business, which later on, can as well be kept as a supplementary account. Diversifying payments with several bank accounts is by all means a trend of the season.
