    Trading Commodities   
 Read below to learn about commodity traders   
 and the type of client that is accepted      
    A commodity is a basic good such as wheat, oil, or iron.   
 Trading paper commodities on a brokerage platform is perfectly acceptable...   
 However, when a client wants to trade physical commodities there are substantial risks involved and extensive due diligence required.   
 We are interested in providing our clients with the best possible service and value.   
 Unfortunately, that means we cannot accept clients trading physical commodities.   
 If you have an inquiry and you're not sure if the client will be accepted, we're happy to review this case with you. Simply click reply and let us know.
