Dear Mr Smith

Thank you for your enquiry regarding the aforementioned. We genuinely appreciate you contacting CFI to assist you in this matter.

To start off, we are attaching our fact-sheet on the formation, structure and management of a new Irish company, for your guidance. Please read this carefully. This is a general overview, and we are more than happy to answer any specific questions that you may have on the registration of your new company.

Preparation of Forms:

In order to avail of the Companies Office fast incorporation scheme, we will need the attached questionnaire to be completed and returned to us (this can be returned by email/fax or post).

Once we receive same, we can prepare all the necessary forms and forward to you for signature.

Incorporation Process:

When we receive these forms back, together with payment of our fees of €419 (including VAT), we will compile the incorporation papers, attend before a Commissioner for Oaths and then lodge them with the CRO.

We will then write to you confirming this, and send you a copy of the Memorandum and Articles which we have drafted on your behalf.

Providing that all the documents are in order the company will be incorporated in one to five working days from the date which they are received in our offices. (This is guaranteed by CRO.)

When this happens, we will immediately contact you by telephone, e-mail or fax and give you the Registered Number and the Date of Incorporation.

At this point we prepare, what we call your “Company Package”. This consists of

1.     The Original Certificate of Incorporation

2.     Draft Minutes of the inaugural Meeting of Directors

3.     Four Bound Copies of the Memorandum and Articles of Association

4.     Share Certificates

5.     Combined Company Register and Minute Book - fully written up.

6.     Company Seal

7.     Guidance Booklet on Duties of Directors

8.     Guidance Booklet on Role of Company Secretary

9.     First Return Form fully completed and ready for signature by the director and secretary of the company.

10.  Delivery of corporate documents to you by secure, recorded delivery

These items are all you need to open bank accounts, register for VAT, obtain Domain Names, and generally activate the company.

If you have any queries on any of the information enclosed, then please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards
