Hi Steve,

please find attached my latest Bank Statement that i got from the bank today. I also attached Endesa Contract from august, change of potencia (Endesa) contract from yesterday, printout from current balance from Endesa and my Banc Sabadell MasterCard statement printout from my internet bank.

Couple of changes, we would like to name myself as a shareholder also so if you could change that and leave Novasigma Limited out. 

Could you also please confirm what we have paid so far and what is yet top be paid? Also could you please confirm time schedule to get company established.

If you need anything else, please do not hesitate to contact me directly

Looking forward to your prompt reply

thank you in advance

Tuomo Antikainen

Dear Steve,
 
That was pdf print from electricity invoice from Endesa. My current address is indeed Rancho Miraflores A BLQ 1 102, 29649 Mijas Malaga, Espana. I will go to Endesa anyway in the morning so  i can  get some further  proof of my address or whatever you wish/need to be printed out for you? Do i need to get them to fax / email the facts for you (with stamps or something else?) or something else? 
 
You will also most likely to be able to change the address  on to my original application? The address on there was most likely my previous one (Avenida Del Sol) which was most likely taken from our CRM in a first place, where I (thats My mistake) didnt change it.
 
Please let me know how to proceed
 
Thank you

Dear Mira Luukkanen
The document provided as proof of address for Mr. Tuomo Olavi Antikainen, seems edited and Mr. Massimiliano Lacognata name is put on someone else’s name. Please attachment ‘FuntasticEvents_TuomoOlaviAntikainen_AddressProblem.jpg’ and you will see that how only the person name and address is getting highlighted and rest of text do not highlight. Which means the name and address text is not part of original document text.

AlSO, Mr. Tuomo Olavi Antikainen address mentioned on document and address mentioned on application is different. Please arrange correct document for Mr. Tuomo Olavi Antikainen so that we can further proceed with your application.
