Hi Charlotte

I spoke to Martin, all he wanted me to do was register for the Payroll Service on the website.

He knew nothing about the year-end accounts so I suggested that he spoke with you and email me with all the details I needed.

I have heard nothing from him.

Can someone please get back to me about what are the next steps as I thought these year end accounts had to be ready by the end of September and you had to do some preliminary work beforehand.

Thanks
Chris

Hi Steve

I was busy all day today, I will try and call Martin on Wednesday.

I am waiting on an answer from you or Charlotte about the year end preparation, she told me that you would need some lead time that’s why I emailed a couple of weeks ago.

Can you please let me know what there is to do

Thanks
Chris

Hi Charlotte/Steve



I called Martin Joseph at your office about a PAYE question, but I got cut off.



Can you ask him to either call me on +44 7808 774179 or better email me with this query.



I am also getting concerned about the year end accounts preparation.



Can you tell me what is the next step?



Thanks

Chris

Hi Charlotte

Is everything setup for PAYE for Advanced Cloud?

We expect the first payslip to be required in October as we are getting revenue coming in at the end of September.

Can you also prepare the invoice for the end of year accounts preparation and remind me of what you need from us.

Many thanks
Chris
