Dear Mr. Tahir, kindly update the payments for both companies for three months, I will pay by next week. It has been more than eight months I didn't visit UK due to death of my brother, I have been very much occupied in family matters.As I have to collect my new cards and make payment when I arrive there.

 

 

Thank you for your help


 

Kind Regards,
