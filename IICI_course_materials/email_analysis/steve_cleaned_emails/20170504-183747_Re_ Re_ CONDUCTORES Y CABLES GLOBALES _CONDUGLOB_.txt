Dear Angela
Please see following emails which will give you
complete details about initial price we gave you, for which service payment was
charged and when it was charged and how service was used.
On
19 August 2016
, Oliver gave you price for
company formation, apostille company documents (to be used for bank account
opening) and bank account processing:
1 BVI company + Euro Pacific Bank Account  - 1600
GBP
1 HK Company + Euro Pacific Bank account – 1000 GBP
On
31 August 2016,
I, Steve gave you message:
we
have only charge payment for company formation and applications are now in
process. Payment for bank account and apostille documents (required for bank
account) will be charged once companies are ready.
- Orderno. 190825 – GBP 690 – BVI Company Formation and Registered Address
- Orderno. 190826 – GBP 695 – Hong Kong Company Formation
and Registered Address
We already pay for apostille documents so you have to ​send them to us because we dont have anything in hard copies of this companie and we need our documents in original , apostille hard copies.
On
25 October 2016,
we received your
confirmation to charge payment for apostille and bank account processing for
Hong Kong Company.
- Bank Account : GBP 500 : Orderno. 191418
- Apostille Company Documents : GBP 300 :
Orderno. 191420
​We already pay for apostille documents so you have to ​send them to us because we dont have anything in hard copies of this companie and we need our documents in original , apostille hard copies.
On
18 January 2016
, you rejected our request to
charge payment for Apostille and bank account processing for BVI Company.
I hope you find above information with reference to
following attached emails satisfactory that:
-
We charged payment
for company formation only
and companies were registered in BVI and Hong Kong
-
We charged payment
for Hong Kong company’s apostille
and bank account processing. Apostille documents which were submitted to bank
for bank account processing, unfortunately bank account application was
rejected by bank. And as per our terms and conditions we do not guarantee bank
account and in case of rejection services charges are non-refundable.
​
THE BANK ACCOUNT IS ALREADY OPEN​
-
We did NOT charged payment
for Apostille and
Bank Account Processing for BVI Companies. And in reply to your today’s previous
email asking for Aspotille BVI documents delivery to a London address. This is
the reason Apostille documents for BVI are not available.
​​
​WE WILL WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN OUR HANDS OF THE HK COMPANY TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH THE BVI
​
​ COMPANY....YOU CAN SEND THE DOCUMENTS TO THIS ADDRES IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LONGER AVAILABLE IN LONDON
