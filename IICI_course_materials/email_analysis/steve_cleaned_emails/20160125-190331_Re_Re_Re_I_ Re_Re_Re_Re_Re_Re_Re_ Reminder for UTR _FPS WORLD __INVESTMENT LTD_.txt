Messrs,

I am sorry but I cannot contact HMRC, becouse I have not their e-mail address.


With your e-mail 22nd Jannuary, I was informed that you would require the Company UTR, please go head.


Best regards


Paolo


Dear Customer,

Thank you for your email.

According to HMRC rules and regulations it is important for a company director to contact HMRC in order to inform them about the changes.

Once you have performed the above task, kindly inform us so that we may once again make a request for UTR Number.

Kind Regards,

We will require your company UTR to update your address at HMRC. Kindly sent us the Unique Tax Reference so we may proceed accordingly. We have already mentioned in our previous  emails that we have requested your company Unique Tax Reference (UTR) on your behalf which you will  receive on your previous register address i.e. 3 Gower Street 1 Floor London WC1E 6HA.
