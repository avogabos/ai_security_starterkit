Dear Steve,

Thank you very much for the update, I have also received an update from the
bank as well about the paperwork they need from my end which I will be on
tomorrow morning and will send to them with immediate effect.

I already have provided you with  the Certified & translated Proof of
Address for the client (is there something else to be done on that agaiin?)
 I will be taking to my lawyer the Notarized Certificate of Incorporation &
Notarized Memorandum and Articles of Association and will send then back to
you accordingly.

I need you help on this: Shareholder and Director Registry. What is this
and to which company does it refer to I do not understand. Pls be kind
enough to clarify it for me.

Awaiting your response and thanking you in advance,

Kind regards,

Maria
