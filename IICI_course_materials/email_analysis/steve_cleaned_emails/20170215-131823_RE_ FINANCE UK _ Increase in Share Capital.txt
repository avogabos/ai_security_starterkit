Hi Cindy

 

Yes share transfer is complete. But we have not increase the share capital, before we increase it I just want you to know allotting maximum number of shares can cause tax liability on company at the time of annual filing and will conflict with company status which is DORMANT. 

The best option is to keep share allotment minimum to 1. Since only 1 share is issued and there are no other shareholder, so current shareholder is considered 100% owner of the company.

 

Please advice how you wish to have the share capital.

 

And there is small issue which we will get it fixed by next week but it will not affect company operations in any way, the issue is we have appointed current director as PSC but we are not able to remove our person form the PSC, it will be done by next week as Companies House and we are looking at our systems to resolve the PSC termination issue.
