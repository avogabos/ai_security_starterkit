Let me look tomorrow Chris, sometimes the credit agency system is out of date and we email them an update. But tomorrow I will see for sure. Thanks

Hi


I have just had a conversation with a finance company who had run a credit check on Advanced Cloud, they inform me that we are still marked as Dormant will zero figures in the accounts to March 31st 2015.


I thought, based on your email below that this would have altered by now, can you explain why we are still marked as Dormant


Thanks
Chris
