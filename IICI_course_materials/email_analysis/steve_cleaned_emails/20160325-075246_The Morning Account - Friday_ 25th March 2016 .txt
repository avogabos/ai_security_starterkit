Sugar tax legal challenge: George Osborne says “bring it on”

Chancellor George Osborne has told soft drinks companies to "bring it on" over reports some are considering a legal challenge to the new sugar tax. The chancellor said the government would consult on the technical details of the tax ahead of its introduction in 2018, but that firms should use that period to reformulate their products rather than waste time and money on legal challenges. It will be levied on the volume of the sugar-sweetened drinks companies produce or import, BBC News notes, and there will be two bands - one for total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 millilitres and a second, higher band, for the most sugary drinks with more than 8 grams per 100 millilitres. The £530m it is expected to raise, the government says, will be spent on primary school sports in England, with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland free to decide how to spend their share.

Sturgeon returns to 50p rate

Nicola Sturgeon has said she will consider introducing a 50p rate of income tax later in the parliament after she was criticised by Kezia Dugdale for abandoning her position as a socialist fighting against austerity. Ms Sturgeon told a Scottish leaders’ debate that she supported increasing the additional rate from 45p to 50p after the Scottish Parliament gets control over the tax next year. She said she had ruled out making the change in April 2017 in response to a civil service analysis warning it might end up losing £30m of tax as well-off people move out of Scotland. “I haven’t ruled it out for the rest of the parliament,” she said. “I think there should be a 50p top rate of tax but we don’t set tax rates if it’s going to lose you money.”

Tim Parker: Rich should pay more 

Businessman Tim Parker, whose wealth is estimated at £185m, has told Management Today that the wealthy should pay 50% income tax, and condemned excessive boardroom pay and inherited wealth. He said: "A free market system needs citizens to believe that the method of redistributing income is fair and effective. If you earn a lot, you should pay a lot in tax... There's a current perception that a small raft of executives are doing very well indeed and that causes disquiet. Paying roughly half seems entirely fair to me." Mr Parker added that there should be more discussion over inherited wealth. "If the starting points are so very unfair then that's not good," he said.

Mission-led businesses may get tax breaks 

A new campaign launched by the Cabinet Office could see almost 200,000 enterprises involved with philanthropy benefit from tax breaks and other forms of government support. Legal & General CEO Nigel Wilson will lead a study into whether "mission-led businesses" – those that have a clear aim to address social ills but are distinct from social enterprises – should be given extra help.

Fear and regulatory loathing makes America the top tax haven 

The FT reports on how the failure of the US to reciprocate tax information sharing arrangements is pushing the global rich to move funds out of Europe and to the US.

DoH pressuring trusts to fiddle their figures  

The Department of Health has asked four accountancy firms to review the way NHS Trusts report their finances, with documents seen by the Telegraph suggesting NHS finance directors are being put under pressure to be less prudent in their forecasting, according to the Nuffield Trust. Briefing documents suggest that trusts will be asked to review 19 specific areas, such as reclassifying assets so they are kept off the balance sheets, or extending their asset lives so they can be valued more highly. Documents drawn up by PwC say finance directors in the NHS will be asked to discuss their "views on prudence in accounts and changes in accounting policies" to see what differences alterations could make to the Department of Health's balance sheets. Nuffield Trust’s Sally Gainsbury said: "This definitely falls into the area of fiddles – being clever about when you book income and when you book expenditure. It pushes most of the problems into the next financial year, it does not solve them." The news comes as figures from NHS regulators show that the deficit for the first three quarters of the year is already £2.26bn - triple what it was for the whole of the previous year.

New measures to improve social mobility in the workplace 

Minister for Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, Matt Hancock, has announced government plans to develop a new measurement of socio-economic background to be used to monitor and manage social mobility in the Civil Service and wider employment in both the public and private sectors. Deloitte, Accenture, O2, Linklaters, KPMG, Barclays, EY, Baker & McKenzie, Grant Thornton, Teach First and the independent Bridge Group are all noted to have already committed to working on the project and over 150 further businesses have now been invited to contribute. Melanie Richards, vice chairman at KPMG, said: "For a number of years we have been working with the Bridge Group who have rigorously analysed our data to understand the effect socio-economic status can have on the recruitment pipeline and have developed analytical tools to help us better target and attract more diverse candidates." The Civil Service is planning to begin using the new measures in the next 12 months and the government will urge businesses and the rest of the public sector to follow suit.

Poor cost culture threatens UK’s competitiveness 

A new study by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) has found that British institutions wasted £194bn in 2015. Finance professionals polled by CIMA said cancelled projects was the most common cause of waste (55%), followed by over-payment for goods or services (43%) and unnecessary purchases (35%). Half said their organisations had no strategy to drive cost competitiveness and a third said there was no mandate to drive down costs when making day-to-day decisions. The banking sector wasted the most and CIMA found only 25% of firms have a board member tasked with maintaining cost competitiveness. Peter Spence, CIMA's head of performance management research, said: “Lack of a cost-conscious culture is a threat to UK competitiveness – we can be as innovative or as creative as we like, but if our products and services cost too much we will not be maximising our profits, and we are at risk of losing out to cheaper competitors.”

Osborne likely to give BoE powers over buy-to-let

Chancellor George Osborne has said the government is highly likely to give the Bank of England powers to regulate mortgages used by landlords to buy homes, possibly even later this year. The BoE has warned growth in the buy-to-let mortgage market poses a potential risk to UK financial stability and it wants to assess the impact of tax changes on the sector before taking any action.

UK banks approve fewer mortgages

British banks approved 45,892 mortgages for house purchases last month, down from 46,916 in January but 20% higher than in February 2015, British Bankers' Association data reveals, suggesting borrowers are continuing to try to get ahead of the forthcoming increases in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second home buyers. The BBA figures do not include lending by mutually owned building societies, which account for around one third of mortgages. The next release of the more comprehensive Bank of England lending data is due on March 31.

Businesses face £1,000 annual charge per non-EU skilled worker 

Businesses will have to pay an annual charge of £1,000 for every skilled worker brought in from outside Europe. The Home Office move, to be brought in by next April, follows a recommendation by the Migration Advisory Committee. It is one of a number of reforms to Tier 2 - the official name for the main migration route for skilled workers coming to the UK from outside Europe. The CBI warned the charge could hold businesses back from accessing talent.
