No, you don't understand. The document sent to us are covered in notary
stamps. CH don't want it like this. I want just normal id scans, I will then
certify and see if they accept that

Customer send the documents by post to us and we then scanned it, we must
have documents in our office.

 

 

Tahir emailed me the scan copies 29th April 2014 and he also mentioned that
you have the hard copies.

They sent everything back - trying to sort this out

They don't like the panama docs.

 

Ask customer to send clear scan of director id (not notarised) and we will
see if they accept our uk certification on it

 

And they don't like the fact the names of the branch is totally different to
the parent name
