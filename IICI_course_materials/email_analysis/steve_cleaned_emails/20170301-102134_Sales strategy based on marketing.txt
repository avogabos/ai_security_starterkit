Dear Team,

 

We have been budgeting for marketing over the last few months and have
implemented a number of focused marketing strategies.

The results are positive and I wanted to highlight a few results to assist
in the sales focus and open a discussion on how to move forward

 

Last week FH website was accessed 2134 times. Tuesday and Thursday were the
peak days. I have attached a chart highlighting the increases in traffic to
the site, and its clear the marketing we are doing is having a huge impact.

 

Traffic is globally increasing but there has been a slight increase in India
and Canada, however Russia France and Italy are still the most common. We
will soon be publishing a small number of the site pages in russain French
and Italian.

Key product interest is UK Ltd and the UK Value Starter Pack. Followed by
Offshore and then LLP, Readymades and then just our other services in
general.

 

Currently the increase in site traffic hasnt translated into an increase in
sales.

 

We need to start also ensuring maximum upsell, and on renewals again
ensuring we try and add on an extra service or see if there is an offer we
can make to extend services.

 

Our registered address renewal is £100, we could if you feel its closable,
offer 2 yrs combined at a discounted price, pay now for 2 years and pay
£150. Online admin we can offer at 25 with the second year at 15,

Accounting services, we need a regular report to let you know which
customers are coming up for accounts filing periods in 3 months

The auto emails we send out arent usually enough and sometimes are missed
as they go into spam, so a specific email followed by a call 3 months before
the final filing date will often succeed in a sale.

 

We must also remember and ensure you understand the various accounting
packages we have and upsell where possible to full outsourced accounts as I
know many customers say its much cheaper than other accountants.

 

Readymades we need to push. 

All agents that you have a good relationship with, remind them and tell them
about specific names, you could include a couple of companies that are a
year old, a couple that are a few years old and maybe one or two that have
active filed accounts, then maybe just state that we have some over 15yrs
old and can source older.

(I will ask Elliot to draft an email template for you to adapt to your
customers)

 

Our Virtual Office services are well priced in the market and we should
again be reminding customers that its available to use etc.

So long as we maintain good compliance we can really push these things.

 

On a side note, the terms and conditions for the website are also being
updated with specific terms for each product. This will make it easier to
handle complaints and refunds.

 

As Owais is doing such a successful job on the marketing strategy, I want to
ensure any new initiatives he wants to trial are fully supported. He may ask
each of you questions and give directions to try certain ideas, please can
you give him your support and any feedback will also be highly appreciated.
Feedback can be directly to me if you prefer, or to Owais or Elliot.

 

Thank you all for your continued support.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Charlotte Pawar
