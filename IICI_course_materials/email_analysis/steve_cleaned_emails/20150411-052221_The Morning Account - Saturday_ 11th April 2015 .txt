Non-dom plans see wealthy flee prime London market
Estate agents have said the super-rich are walking away from London’s prime property market over fears a Labour government will end their non-dom status. Douglas & Gordon said they had carried out 37 valuations in the past month for owners thinking of selling up – six times normal levels - while sales of homes worth more than £2m have dropped by 80% in the past year. Charles McDowell said two deals collapsed this week as a result of the non-dom plans while Trevor Abrahmsohn at Glentree Estates described the non-doms proposal as “completely mad” adding that 50% of clients were considering “establishing citizenship elsewhere”. However, Roarie Scarisbrick at Property Vision said the mood simply reflected normal pre-election jitters. Wealth managers, lawyers and accountants also expressed concern many non-doms could choose to move to Switzerland, Monaco, Singapore or Hong Kong.  James Hender at Saffery Champness said a tipping point was approaching where “wealthy international clients are feeling unwelcome here” while Blick Rothenberg’s Nimesh Shah said their inherent international mobility meant large numbers could depart, a view echoed by Piers Master at Charles Russell Speechlys. The Economist however, welcomes the plans, but says Labour’s problem is that its policies too often seem less about restoring equitable tax treatment than sowing discord by demonising financial success.

Osborne: Labour will bring back fuel duty escalator
The deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman has admitted that increases in fuel duty, along with rises in alcohol and tobacco taxes, would not be ruled out until Labour drew up its post-election Budget. George Osborne said the comments were proof Ed Miliband is “planning to bring back the last Labour Government's fuel duty escalator”

New tax breaks come into force
Adam Palin points out that several reliefs have come into force that will see low earners pay less tax on their income. A new "zero" rate on the first £5,000 of savings income for individuals earning less than the personal tax-free allowance will benefit retired savers in particular, he writes, while the married couples allowance could save low and middle-income households up to £212 a year.

HMRC has introduced new forms - P50Z and P53Z and P55 - which will allow people to reclaim overpaid tax on pension income payments within 30 working days. Until now reclaiming the tax would have meant waiting until the next tax year.

Interview: Gay Huey Evans
Margareta Pagana interviews Gay Huey Evans in the Standard. Ms Huey Evans is deputy chair of the Financial Reporting Council and forms part of the new Fair and Effective Markets group. She says of City culture: “There’s still a funny smell after the crash and the Libor and mis-selling scandals. It’s not just in the City - it’s a global problem. The culture got rotten and there are still rotten apples in the barrel - and we have to get rid of them. It’s vital for the UK economy that the capital markets are working efficiently and fairly.” She discusses bonuses, which she believes should be the exception rather than the norm, leadership and diversity.

Recognising revenue from historical contracts
E-commerce firm Blur Group said the company and its auditors, KPMG, are in the process of dealing with enquiries from the Financial Reporting Council regarding the inclusion of sales in its accounts that may not materialise. Projects begun in 2013 and 2014 had experienced delays, they said. Shares in the online marketplace for business services fell 30% as it warned full-year revenues would be “substantially lower than previously expected” as a result.

PENSIONS

Caution main theme of pensions changes
Several papers review the new pension rules allowing the over-55’s to withdraw cash from their savings. Scottish Widows said 2% of eligible clients had contacted the firm about withdrawals and warned people not to rush in to a decision while Fidelity reported a fifth of its customers in company pension plans wanting to cash out. They note that for wealthy individuals “tax levied on full withdrawal is only marginally higher than they would pay in drawdown on higher-rate tax.” The Guardian issues a warning over tax rates on withdrawals while the Independent talks to a businessman who was refused access to his pension by Aviva. Meanwhile, the FT’s James Pickford talks to property experts who deny there will be a rush of people cashing in their pensions to invest in buy-to-let properties.

Glencore ends diversion of Australian coal sales through Singapore
Swiss mining firm Glencore has told an Australian parliamentary inquiry that it will stop funnelling sales from its Australian coal operations through Singapore. Glencore said the decision was made following its 2013 merger with Xstrata. "Australia coal sales will now be done directly from our Australian companies to end-customers," Glencore said, now that it has integrated Xstrata's coal marketing business into its global marketing. Glencore is among 15 firms being audited by the Australian tax office over their marketing-hub units in Singapore.

EU law means credit card loyalty schemes face demise
New EU rules, which take effect in October, will see credit card issuers only able to charge shops a maximum "interchange" rate of 0.3% on credit cards or 0.2% on debit cards, down from 0.7% and 9p respectively. Capital One is the first firm to react, cutting cash back rewards for customers and removing all new reward cards from sale. The loss to card issuers could reach £2.4bn, experts say.
