Sorry this doesn't make sense

 

I think what he is saying is that he doesn't want to come to the uk for the
bank appointment, instead he wants to go in to a branch n home country, this
is possible by prior agreement but we need a lot of detail first

 

Also, FBME has its branch in Cyprus but it is not a Cypriot bank, they also
have a Tanzania branch which the account can be moved to once opened.

 

We can also do Rietumu

Hi

 

 

Please advice on following query from customer.

 

 

 

With regards to the bank, I did ask last evening with my friends fromUk and
they said FBME is not that popular and cyprus as a country is struggling
with economy and also we are aware of government freezing 10% of funds for
all account holders. this is quite un stable.

I prefer barclays or other UK banks. - I know our precence in thebank is
required only to verify accound holders identity. some company formation
firms in Uk say that it is possible to open an account in uk. but myidentity
need to be approved by the same banks foreign brach representative in any
country. or the British high commission or embassy.

Can you please verify this with the banks ( Barclays) and let me know.
