Steve,
No, no one here has applied for the online gateway pin.  In fact, when  
we first received the notices to file the Annual Returns, I went to  
the HMRC website to try and file myself because I wasn't getting  
anywhere with Formations Houses.  When I tried to register, I received  
a message saying that someone had already done that.  As our  
representative, I assume it was Formations House that did it.

Please confirm that I do not have to call HMRC, as your first email  
said.

Thank you,
Stefanie

We have received the online gateway pin from HMRC. However, we are unable to activate it as it seems that someone else has also applied for the pin. Please confirm if you have applied for HMRC online gateway pin. If yes, then please provide us with the ID and Password that you have set with the HMRC so that we can activate and submit the filings.
If this is not the case then we will re-apply for the PIN.
Waiting for your reply.
Thank you
Steve

Steve,
Thank you, again.
I have FedEx'd the 2009 return.  You mention that I will receive confirmation that it has been received.  In what form does that confirmation come?
Please update me as you get more information about the pin for the online gateway.
Regards,
Stefanie

Please submit the 2009 Tax Return to HMRC and once you receive the confirmation that it has been received by HMRC you can then call them inform that your company has been dormant and asked them to remove the penalty.
As for your Tax Returns for 2010, it will be submitted electronically by us as soon as we receive the online gateway pin for your company.
Regarding submission of Annual Returns and DCA, those have been filed to Companies House for the year 2010. And now your next annual returns and accounts are due January 2012.
And regarding CT41G, it is not necessary for a non-trading to submit the this document, you can also mention this to HMRC  when will call for penalty waiver.
Regards
Steve

Re: Company ID 8138444
Steve,
Attached are the most recent letters fro HRMC.
I have not paid the penalties for the late tax returns.  Nor have I mailed the 2009 return.   I was waiting for the 2010 return so i could send them all together with a letter requesting waiver of the penalties.
However, I will mail the 2009 returns right away.
You say DCA has  been filed.  I assume this is for 2010.
Please confirm that the Annual Return has also been filed.  That is the £15 that was paid on April 26th.
At this point, I am inclined to just pay the £100 penalty on the tax returns for each year, just to clear everything up and nothing will be outstanding any more.  However, I would prefer to pay it through the online gateway, once access is received.  Do you know if online payments are allowed?
I also have a question about the CT41G:
It was issued by HMRC, and the instructions say I am to complete it and return it to them.  But, there is also a CT41G Dormant Companies Insert, which has a line that reads "The company is dormant, I have kept form CT41G and will send it back when the company becomes active".
I am uncertain as to whether or not I should send the CT41G WITH the Dormant Company Insert, or just send the Insert.  The form does say to read the Notes for New Companies for instructions, but I do not have those instructions and don't know where to find them.
Please advise how I should handle all of these latest issues.
Thank you,
Stefanie
