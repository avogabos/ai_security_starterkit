Dear Steve,

thank you very much for your great service.

I am waiting for some reply to start the business.

About business bank account for the UK LTD: where is it possible to open it? I would like in Euro area or SEPA (UK should be ok).

Banking operations will be limited to sending and receiving - only in Eur
currency - bank wire transfer to/from suppliers/customers based in Italy: very
important will be to have Internet banking service. The wire transfer will be
ordered from me, only via Internet banking.



No financing requirements.



That transfers will be «high in number» but «low in amount», so it will be
important to have low charges for each transfer.



I would like to know if it is possible, and how it is possible to open a
business bank account with you and to know the charges/fees to open/manage the
account: especially the charges to send/receive payments (only Eur currency -
only via Internet banking), so please help me to have this information.

About proof of ID: do you will accept a valid Italian Identity Card or a valid Italian Driving Licence? 


Best Regards

Albert

That holding company should be the sole member of an US LLC.

agent to incorporate.



But as legal advisor in Italy, maybe in the future, I could have some clients
who may be interested in "The Gambia incorporation".



Best Regards
