Re: Advanced Cloud Solutions LLP suspended
Hi Steve
I have arranged the payment of Â£250 to the account below, you
should see this in your account this afternoon with the reference ACS LLP
renew.
In terms of the accounts, what form do you need the data - we have
not transacted that much last year and I have all of the information on a large
spread sheet.
Can you tell me what you need and who I should give it to.
Thanks
Chris

Hi Steve/Charlotte
I have just noticed on your system that the LLP has been
suspended.
I ordered a renewal of the LLP some time ago so why wasn't this
actioned.
Can you please tell me what needs to happen to correct this
situation.
Thanks
Chris
