Hi Oliver,

We have just chat with you. Our company is Staince Investments, Ltd. and we'd like to use your service for annual accounting again. I need a bit of help with a payment for your services (we used your service several times and every time there is something new :)) and a template for an accounting data - we usually send out our transactions list using your templates and the rest is done by your company, including reports to Companies House. I would be happy if we could do the same this time.

Thank you for care,
Alex
