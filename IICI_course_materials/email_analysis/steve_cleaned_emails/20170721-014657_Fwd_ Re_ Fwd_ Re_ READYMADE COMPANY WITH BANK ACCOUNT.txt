Dear Bettina,



Unfortunately our account services are down at the moment. While we were in the process of migrating all our data and services from our ld office in Harley Street to our new facility, there was a massive external power failure in  the stree and this brought down our servers at the key moment. we have worked non stop to bring all the services and data back online and expect most of the services to be available by the end of today



Please remind us which company you are looking for documents and we can see whether we can manually access them at our end



thanks
