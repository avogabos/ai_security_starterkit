Steve,
thanks a lot for these details.
Actually we will have one director and a shareholder  so no nominee service
at the end.
The company will not be trading so I kept only VAT registration and bank
account  which are useful. For the bank account is it possible to propose a
bank that the future owner would prefer i.e HSBC ?

I've selected the following services. Did i miss something that seems
important

wish to have company's bank account, then you will need to have our Managed

company's bank account on your behalf.
