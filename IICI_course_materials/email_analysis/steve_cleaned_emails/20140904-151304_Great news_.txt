Great news on a new weekly project

Hello,



How are you doing? I trust you had a
great summer holiday. For me the summer was one I'll never forget.
Weather reasonable and I have made some big choices in life.



First of all the great news: the first
podcast is online. Just follow this link
and you arrive on the podcast page, listen to it and send me a
message, prefered cia the website, on what you like about it and what
not. What person would you like to hear on the podcast?



On the podcast you will also find the
biggest choices I have made. 




For Aspectus the summer was one of
setting up and creating several interesting partnerships. Including a
discreet transaction, a consultancy project on filling conference
rooms and setting up some trade transactions. Progress will you find
in the podcast.



Talks with financiers for a few
projects, initiated by Aspectus, are going on. Which, hopefully will
create some employment opportunitys. All (as always) 100% legal tax
free. The way we can solve the current crisis.



As a information source, for your
research, I would like to offer you a idea source you can listen to
on your iPod. The most listenend talk radio programm of the USA. Just
