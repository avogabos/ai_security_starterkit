Hello Steve,

Wanted to wish you a happy holidays and appreciate you forwarding over the
documents to us.

I have completed the bank application form and had a few questions on
specific items that you can find below:

1. On Page 2 - Our director has never to to Cyprus, so can we leave the
dates of entry and exit of Cyprus fields blank?

2. On Page 4 - Section A with Institution Details what specifically is
supposed to be filled out here?

3. Page 7, 9, 11 - The account number is asked and do we leave this blank
for the bank, correct?

4. For the debit card what is the minimum deposit that is needed for the
card?

Thank you and once you have answered these questions for us I will email
you over the documents for review then send them to your office by express
courier.

Please let me know and do have a nice day.

Risbon Astier
