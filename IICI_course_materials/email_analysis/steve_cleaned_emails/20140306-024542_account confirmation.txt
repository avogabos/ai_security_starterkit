Hi Steve,

In order to be able to go further with our startup ideas(in business), we
would like to be sure that our LTD company has a legitimate existence in
the UK HMRC office. As a confirmation, would you be able provide us with
any valid letter(with a company tax reference number on it) from HMRC?

Would I be able to apply for business banking in UK(non-resident startup
account)?


Kind Regards,
Farkhat J.
