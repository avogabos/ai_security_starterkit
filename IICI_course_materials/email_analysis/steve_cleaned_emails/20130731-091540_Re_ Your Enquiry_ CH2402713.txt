Dear Sir

Re:  RABLO EXPORT (UK) LIMITED   No.  5684924

Thank you for your email.

To make an administrative restoration application you will need to file
the following documents, fees and late filing penalties:

1) Form RT01 with a filing fee of £100.00.

2) The annual returns for 31 January 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012
and 2013. There are no filing fees for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 annual
returns but the later returns have a filing fee of £40.00 per form.

3) Accounts for the period ending 31 January 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,
2011 and 2012.

4) A late filing penalty of £150.00 for the accounts ending 31 January
2007. There are no penalties for the later accounts as they became
outstanding after the company was dissolved.

5) A waiver letter from the Treasury Solicitors, which can be ordered
online at

Yours faithfully
