Incorporation a business in spain
Hi Steve,
We are interested in incorporating a new business entity in
Spain using the two IBC's we currently have you (Henry Weber and Dalton
Pascal).
We'd also be interested in setting up a business bank
account in Spain and if you provide a merchant account.
Please let us know if this something you can assist us with.
