Dear

Yes
we received your payment of GBP 2165/-.
‘Detailed Business Activity, Source of fund and Expected name of
countries where company might approach for business’ information is not
required if you do not want to use Nominee Director service. The reason for
asking this information is because since we act as Nominee Director we should
review this information whether to approve or reject Nominee Director
appointment.
Also Nominee Director cannot sign any document or provide due
diligence for bank account opening therefore bank account opening is not
possible with Nominee Director appointment.
Now
as per your instructions I will resubmit your order without Nominee Director
and Nominee Shareholder service. In new order I will appoint you as director
and share holder. For shareholder please provide how many shares out of
100000

following services, please approve.
