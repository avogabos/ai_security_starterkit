Dear Mr. Steve,
 
I remembered about the credit. It was 500 GBP which was given to open an account is RBS.
 
When they failed to open the account the fund was to be credited. The trailing mail of yours will confirm.
 
Kindly do the needful in this regards and oblige. 


With sincere compliments & best wishes....
