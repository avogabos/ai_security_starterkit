Steve, thanks for reply.
But price isn't suitable.
There was only one problem - annual return wasn't submitted in time. That's
why it happened I guess. Annual account was filed at June 2016 - in time.
I will wait final price but 2600 pounds - not suitable.

Hi,
I have submitted
request with company registrar to confirm exact requirements for restoration.
Normally company registrar within 3-4 working days so as soon as I have an
update I will inform you.
Please note
that minimum Restoration Charges and Service Fee is GBP 2600/- and then there
will be add on such as renewal of services, missing annual return and annual
accounts filing and maybe penalties for late filings.
I will give
you exact requirement and cost once have all the information from company
registrar.
If you
require further information or assistance you can contact us by email, by phone
or by live chat on our website.
