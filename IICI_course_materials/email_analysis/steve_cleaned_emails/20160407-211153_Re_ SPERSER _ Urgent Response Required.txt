If you need, we can transfer company SPERSER to your previous
Customer ID. Please confirm?
And regarding due diligence documents we are checking with our
due diligence department if your proof of ID (passport) is still valid then we
can use it. However for proof of residential address we need the document to be

Please arrange required document as soon as possible and also
confirm if you wish to transfer company into your previous Customer ID.

Re: SPERSER : Urgent Response Required
Hi Steve,
I pressed send before I
intended to on my previous email, I was trying to say that you should already
have my details on file, I made a mistake of creating a new account whereas I
should have used my existing one.  Can you verify my details with what you
already have on file?
Regards,
A N Rashid

Hi Steve,
Thank you for your email. 
When ordering this company formation, I completed the new user form whereas I
realised I already have an account with you and should have used that.  My
customer ID for the other account is 25625837
Can you very my ID from that
account?  As I believe you only ever need to this for your customers once.
Thanks,
Abdul Noor Rashid
