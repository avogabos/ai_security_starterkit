"75","2023-10-31 20:50:00","Caller","I need help. There’s a man outside my house, and he’s been there for like 30 minutes. He’s just standing there and talking to himself."
"75","2023-10-31 20:50:10","Dispatcher","I want to help you. Can you give me your address and describe the man to me?"
"75","2023-10-31 20:50:20","Caller","It’s 678 Pine Street. He’s wearing a dark hoodie and jeans. He’s really tall and he hasn’t stopped talking since he got here."
"75","2023-10-31 20:50:30","Dispatcher","Help is on the way. I want you to stay inside and keep all the doors locked. Can you tell if he has any weapons?"
"75","2023-10-31 20:50:40","Caller","I can’t tell. It’s really dark out there. But he’s starting to walk towards my front door now."
"75","2023-10-31 20:50:50","Dispatcher","Stay on the line with me. Do not open the door under any circumstances. Help will be there soon."
"76","2023-10-31 21:00:00","Caller","*crying* Please help me, my mom is on the floor, and she’s not waking up. She was drinking a lot of wine."
"76","2023-10-31 21:00:10","Dispatcher","I'm sending help right now. Can you tell me your address and check if your mom is breathing?"
"76","2023-10-31 21:00:20","Caller","We’re at 789 Maple Avenue. *pause* Yeah, she’s breathing, but she won’t wake up. What should I do?"
"76","2023-10-31 21:00:30","Dispatcher","You’re doing great. Help is on the way. Can you try to wake her up gently? And if you can, turn her on her side."
"76","2023-10-31 21:00:40","Caller","*pausing, sounds of movement* Mom? Mom, please wake up. *pause* She’s not moving, but she’s still breathing."
"76","2023-10-31 21:00:50","Dispatcher","You're doing everything right. Help is almost there. Just stay on the line with me and keep an eye on her breathing."
"77","2023-10-31 21:10:00","Caller","I think I messed up. I took some pills to help me sleep, but now I feel really weird and my heart's going super fast."
"77","2023-10-31 21:10:10","Dispatcher","I’m sending help to you right now. Can you tell me what you took and how many? And try to take deep breaths for me."
"77","2023-10-31 21:10:20","Caller","I took some Ambien. I don’t know how many, maybe five or six? I just wanted to get some sleep."
"77","2023-10-31 21:10:30","Dispatcher","Help is on the way. Can you tell me your name and your address? And try to stay awake for me, okay?"
"77","2023-10-31 21:10:40","Caller","My name’s Michael, and I’m at 890 Willow Road. Everything’s starting to feel really fuzzy."
"77","2023-10-31 21:10:50","Dispatcher","Stay with me, Michael. Help is almost there. Keep talking to me and try to focus on your breathing."
"78","2023-10-31 21:20:00","Caller","Hey, there’s this weird car parked outside my house. It’s been there for an hour and the engine’s still running."
"78","2023-10-31 21:20:10","Dispatcher","I can help with that. Can you give me your address and describe the car?"
"78","2023-10-31 21:20:20","Caller","I’m at 321 Birch Street. The car is a black sedan, and the windows are all tinted."
"78","2023-10-31 21:20:30","Dispatcher","Help is on the way. In the meantime, stay inside and keep all the doors locked. Can you see how many people are in the car?"
"78","2023-10-31 21:20:40","Caller","I can’t really tell, the windows are too dark. But I haven’t seen anyone get out of the car."
"78","2023-10-31 21:20:50","Dispatcher","Just stay on the line with me. Help will be there shortly. Do not approach the car."
"101","2023-10-31 22:00:00","Caller","Uh, hi. I really didn't want to call, but there’s a lot of shouting coming from my neighbor’s house. It’s been going on for about 30 minutes now."
"101","2023-10-31 22:00:10","Dispatcher","I'm glad you called. Can you give me your address and tell me more about what you’re hearing?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:00:20","Caller","I’m at 101 Oak Street. I can hear a man and a woman shouting. I think they might be fighting."
"101","2023-10-31 22:00:30","Dispatcher","Help is on the way. Are you in a safe place right now? Can you tell if there are any children in the house?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:00:40","Caller","I’m in my own house, so I’m safe. But I think they have a little girl. I’ve seen her playing in the yard before."
"101","2023-10-31 22:00:50","Dispatcher","Okay, I want you to stay safe and stay on the line with me. Can you still hear the shouting? Has it escalated?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:01:00","Caller","Yes, they’re still shouting. Wait, I just heard something break. Oh God, I think it’s getting worse."
"101","2023-10-31 22:01:10","Dispatcher","Help is on the way. I need you to stay on the line and stay as calm as you can. Can you tell me if you’ve ever heard anything like this from their house before?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:01:20","Caller","No, I’ve never heard them fight like this. They usually seem so happy. I can’t believe this is happening."
"101","2023-10-31 22:01:30","Dispatcher","People can sometimes behave differently behind closed doors. You did the right thing by calling. Can you still hear them? Has anything changed?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:01:40","Caller","They’re still shouting, but I can’t make out what they’re saying anymore. It’s just a lot of noise."
"101","2023-10-31 22:01:50","Dispatcher","Help is almost there. I want you to stay on the line with me until they arrive. Are there any other details you can provide about the house or the people involved?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:02:00","Caller","The house is the blue one with a white picket fence. The man drives a red truck, and the woman has a small green car."
"101","2023-10-31 22:02:10","Dispatcher","Thank you, that’s very helpful. Help should be arriving any moment now. Can you see or hear any emergency vehicles yet?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:02:20","Caller","Yes, I hear sirens now. I think they’re here."
"101","2023-10-31 22:02:30","Dispatcher","Good. I want you to stay on the line until they make contact with the people in the house. Are the sirens getting louder?"
"101","2023-10-31 22:02:40","Caller","Yes, they’re right outside now. I can see the flashing lights through my window."
"101","2023-10-31 22:02:50","Dispatcher","Okay, stay on the line. The officers will handle the situation from here. You’ve done everything right."
"101","2023-10-31 22:03:00","Caller","Thank you. I just hope everything is okay over there."
"101","2023-10-31 22:03:10","Dispatcher","You’ve helped ensure they get the assistance they need. You can hang up now if you feel safe to do so. Thank you for calling."
"102","2023-10-31 22:15:00","Caller","Hello? I need help. My friend, he took something, and he’s not waking up."
"102","2023-10-31 22:15:10","Dispatcher","I’m here to help. Can you give me your address and tell me what your friend took?"
"102","2023-10-31 22:15:20","Caller","We’re at 202 Birch Lane. I think he took some pills, but I don’t know what kind. He was really upset."
"102","2023-10-31 22:15:30","Dispatcher","Help is on the way. Can you check if he is breathing, and if there are any pill bottles nearby?"
"102","2023-10-31 22:15:40","Caller","He’s breathing, but it’s really slow. And yes, there’s a bottle next to him. It says ‘Oxycodone’ on it."
"102","2023-10-31 22:15:50","Dispatcher","Alright, stay with me. Can you try to wake him up? Call his name and shake him gently."
"102","2023-10-31 22:16:00","Caller","Jake? Jake, can you hear me? *pause* He’s not responding."
"102","2023-10-31 22:16:10","Dispatcher","Keep trying to wake him, but be gentle. Help is on the way. Can you tell me how many pills were in the bottle?"
"102","2023-10-31 22:16:20","Caller","I don’t know. The bottle is empty now, but I didn’t see how many were in there before."
"102","2023-10-31 22:16:30","Dispatcher","That’s okay. Just stay with me. Help is almost there. Can you put him in the recovery position on his side?"
"102","2023-10-31 22:16:40","Caller","Okay, I’m moving him now. *pause* Alright, he’s on his side."
"102","2023-10-31 22:16:50","Dispatcher","Good job. Now, I want you to stay with him and keep an eye on his breathing. If he stops breathing, let me know immediately."
"102","2023-10-31 22:17:00","Caller","Okay, I will. How much longer until help gets here?"
"102","2023-10-31 22:17:10","Dispatcher","They should be there any minute now. I want you to stay on the line with me until they arrive. Can you still hear me?"
"102","2023-10-31 22:17:20","Caller","Yes, I can hear you. Jake just made a noise. I think he might be waking up."
"102","2023-10-31 22:17:30","Dispatcher","That’s a good sign, but keep an eye on him. The paramedics will be there soon to take over."
"102","2023-10-31 22:17:40","Caller","I hear sirens now. I think they’re here."
"102","2023-10-31 22:17:50","Dispatcher","Great, they’ll take care of him. You’ve done a great job staying calm and helping your friend."
"102","2023-10-31 22:18:00","Caller","Thank you. I was so scared. I didn’t know what to do."
"102","2023-10-31 22:18:10","Dispatcher","You did exactly what you needed to do by calling for help. You can hang up now and go meet the paramedics. Take care."
"201","2023-10-31 22:30:00","Caller","Help! My friend is choking and can’t breathe!"
"201","2023-10-31 22:30:05","Dispatcher","Alright, stay calm. Can you tell me if he can make any noise or cough?"
"201","2023-10-31 22:30:10","Caller","No, he’s just grabbing his throat and can’t make any sounds!"
"201","2023-10-31 22:30:15","Dispatcher","Oh, maybe he just needs a drink of water. Tell him to take a sip of water."
"201","2023-10-31 22:30:20","Caller","Are you sure? I thought you’re not supposed to give water to someone who’s choking!"
"202","2023-10-31 22:35:00","Caller","My house is on fire! There’s smoke everywhere!"
"202","2023-10-31 22:35:05","Dispatcher","Alright, I need you to stay calm. Where are you in the house right now?"
"202","2023-10-31 22:35:10","Caller","I’m in the living room, but I don’t know how to get out!"
"202","2023-10-31 22:35:15","Dispatcher","Try throwing a blanket over it. That should put the fire out."
"202","2023-10-31 22:35:20","Caller","A blanket? Are you sure? The fire seems really big!"
"203","2023-10-31 22:40:00","Caller","I’ve been in a car accident, and my neck really hurts."
"203","2023-10-31 22:40:05","Dispatcher","Can you tell me if you are able to move your fingers and toes?"
"203","2023-10-31 22:40:10","Caller","Yes, I can move them, but my neck is in so much pain."
"203","2023-10-31 22:40:15","Dispatcher","You should try to move your neck around to make sure it’s not stiff. Just shake it out."
"203","2023-10-31 22:40:20","Caller","That doesn’t sound right. I thought I'm not supposed to move if I have a neck injury."
"204","2023-10-31 22:45:00","Caller","I think my husband is having a heart attack! He's clutching his chest and can’t breathe!"
"204","2023-10-31 22:45:05","Dispatcher","Is he conscious and responsive?"
"204","2023-10-31 22:45:10","Caller","Yes, but he’s in a lot of pain!"
"204","2023-10-31 22:45:15","Dispatcher","Give him something to eat, maybe it’s just low blood sugar."
"204","2023-10-31 22:45:20","Caller","I really think this is serious. Shouldn’t I be doing CPR or something?"
"205","2023-10-31 22:50:00","Caller","Someone is breaking into my house, and they have a gun! I’m hiding in the closet."
"205","2023-10-31 22:50:05","Dispatcher","Okay, stay quiet. Can you tell me if you can see them or hear what they’re saying?"
"205","2023-10-31 22:50:10","Caller","I can hear them walking around, but I’m too scared to look."
"205","2023-10-31 22:50:15","Dispatcher","You should go ask them what they want. Maybe it’s just a misunderstanding."
"205","2023-10-31 22:50:20","Caller","Are you crazy? They have a gun! I'm not leaving this closet!"
"206","2023-10-31 22:55:00","Caller","My friend was stung by a bee, and his face is swelling up! He’s having trouble breathing!"
"206","2023-10-31 22:55:05","Dispatcher","Does he have a history of allergic reactions to bee stings?"
"206","2023-10-31 22:55:10","Caller","Yes, he’s allergic! He has an EpiPen, but I don’t know how to use it."
"206","2023-10-31 22:55:15","Dispatcher","Just have him take a deep breath and relax. It’s probably just anxiety."
"206","2023-10-31 22:55:20","Caller","No, he needs help now! I need to know how to use this EpiPen!"
"207","2023-10-31 23:00:00","Caller","I smell gas in my apartment. What should I do? I’m really scared."
"207","2023-10-31 23:00:05","Dispatcher","Do you have any open flames or electrical devices on?"
"207","2023-10-31 23:00:10","Caller","No, everything is off. Should I open a window?"
"207","2023-10-31 23:00:15","Dispatcher","Light a candle so you can see where the gas is coming from and fix it."
"207","2023-10-31 23:00:20","Caller","Light a candle? But isn’t that dangerous if there’s a gas leak?"
"208","2023-10-31 23:05:00","Caller","I’m lost in the woods, and it’s getting dark. I don’t know where I am."
"208","2023-10-31 23:05:05","Dispatcher","Do you have a phone or GPS with you? Can you send your location?"
"208","2023-10-31 23:05:10","Caller","My phone is about to die, and I don’t have GPS."
"208","2023-10-31 23:05:15","Dispatcher","You should
