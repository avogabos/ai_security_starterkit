  "detailed_summary": "<A thorough, one-paragraph analysis that includes:
    - The specific data types present (e.g., text, integers, dates)
    - The range or distribution of values, if applicable
    - Patterns, trends, or anomalies observed in the data
    - Potential entities or concepts represented by the data
    - Possible relationships to other data in the database
