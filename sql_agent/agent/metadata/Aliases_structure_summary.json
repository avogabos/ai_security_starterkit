  "table_summary": "The 'Aliases' table is designed to store information about alternative names or pseudonyms associated with individuals. It contains three columns: 'Id', an INTEGER serving as the primary key for uniquely identifying each alias entry; 'Alias', a TEXT field that holds the actual alias or alternative name; and 'PersonId', an INTEGER that links each alias to a specific person in another table, likely representing the individual's unique identifier in the overall database schema."
