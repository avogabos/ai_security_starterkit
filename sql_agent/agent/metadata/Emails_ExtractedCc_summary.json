  "summary": "The data consists of email CC (carbon copy) fields extracted from a collection of emails, represented as text.",
  "detailed_summary": "The 'ExtractedCc' column from the 'Emails' table contains text data representing the carbon copy recipients of various emails. The values range from empty strings to email addresses and distribution lists, including both individual names and groups. Some entries are formatted as plain text names, while others include email addresses in angle brackets. Notably, some rows are completely empty, indicating either missing or non-existent CC information for those emails. There are patterns such as names followed by email addresses and semicolon-separated lists of recipients. The data appears to represent entities like individual recipients (e.g., 'Crowley, Philip J') and organizational groups (e.g., 'SES_DutyDeputies'). Potential relationships to other data in the database could include linking email addresses to user profiles or organizational roles. Data quality issues include inconsistent formatting and missing values, which could impact downstream processing and analysis."
