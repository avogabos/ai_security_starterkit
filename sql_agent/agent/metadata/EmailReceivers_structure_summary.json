  "table_summary": "The EmailReceivers table is designed to manage the relationship between email communications and their recipients. It includes three columns: 'Id', which is a unique identifier for each record, 'EmailId', which links to the specific email being sent, and 'PersonId', which identifies the recipient of the email. This structure suggests that the table is used to track which individuals have received which emails, likely for purposes such as marketing, notifications, or other forms of communication."
