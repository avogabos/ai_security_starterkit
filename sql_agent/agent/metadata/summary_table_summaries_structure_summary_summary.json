  "detailed_summary": "The dataset comprises textual data, specifically summaries that describe the structure of various tables within a database. These summaries likely include information about table names, column names, data types, and possibly constraints or relationships between tables. The text data appears to be unstructured and varies in length, suggesting a range of detail in the descriptions. Patterns observed may include repeated mentions of common data types (e.g., integers, text, dates) and frequent references to primary and foreign keys, indicating relationships between tables. Potential entities represented by the data include database tables, columns, and their attributes. The summaries might be related to metadata or schema information in the database. Data quality issues could include inconsistencies in terminology, varying levels of detail, and potential omissions or inaccuracies in the descriptions."
