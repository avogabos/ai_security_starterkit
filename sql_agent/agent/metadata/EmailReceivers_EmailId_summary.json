  "detailed_summary": "The data comprises integer values under the column EmailId in the EmailReceivers table. A sample of 19 EmailId values is provided, along with summary statistics for the entire dataset. The count of EmailId entries is 9306, with an average value of approximately 3922.91. The minimum and maximum values are 1 and 7945, respectively. The sample values range from 227 to 7287. This data likely represents unique identifiers for received emails, which could be linked to other tables containing email content, sender information, or timestamps. No anomalies are immediately apparent in the sample, although the absence of detailed statistics for individual sample values suggests that further analysis might be required to identify any data quality issues or patterns. The data appears to be well-distributed, with no extreme outliers in the sample values provided."
